@markknoller @nloquendi @BernieSanders Trump's opinion is as welcome as a fart in an elevator, when it come to Democratic Party affairs.

Twitter is easy to pick on		but there are few places where one can have as lively a conversation about public affairs with people from all sorts of perspectives.		If our town hall conversations were as vigorous in the last 20 years	I doubt we would have made the Trump mistake.
it may be good to remember Will Rogers quip about his political party:		"I belong to no organized political party.  I am a  Democrat!"		We need all of us to work together who agree on most of the issues		We can't win the Senate or POTUS divided among ourselves
It is clear from the varied reactions to Bernie Sanders presidential run that many Democrats think a smaller Democratic Tent will still win the White House.   		I believe we better embrace EVERYONE who leans our way, keep the Democratic Tent as big as possible if we want to win
@profmusgrave You're sharper than that slur
@AidenWolfe @jocowboys87 That is a special kind of ridiculousness.		The NEVER Bernie crowd is full of vitriol for him.		Don't like Bernie?  Don't vote for him. 		Which candidate(s) will you advocate positively for president?  THAT is our current concern, not how much some late any one candidate.
@Yair_Rosenberg more left-leaning Americans cannibalizing their support base for the next Democratic nominee.		There are few things sadder than Democrats embracing a fight among like-minded friends for reasons that have nothing to do with effectively governing the USA with Democratic control.

@potus		What shouts CRISIS  LOUDER		than a prez who declares a national border emergency		where none exists 		after 2 years of zero border action by his Republicans controlling Congress		THEN the prez skips town for a week of golf at his Fla club		paid for by We taxpayers?		Fraud
@xxxxm3m3 @alllibertynews @LPNational Does evidence matter?  Net migration in is at historic lows. Border cities are safer than Chicago, st louis, NYC.  Migrants commit less crimes than native born.

Bernie expanded the Democratic tent.  Those same centrists want it shrunk small enough to lose again by their actions
Bernie Sanders plans a post SOTU response as well.  Marvelous.		Since when in America can we have only one voice raised in opposition to the likes of Trump. Neither Harris nor Sanders diminishes Abrams' address in any way.  3 strong voices raising concerns about Trump is better!!
I continue to be disappointed that people looking forward to responses to the SOTU  seem to believe only one voice may be raised for that purpose.	@RoseBeckley @staceyabrams will be fabulous.   Kamala Harris apparently plans a "prequel" address.   Wonderful!!
@errollouis Why should Bernie not say his piece?   1st Amendment suspended?  Only "real" Democrats may talk in response? No one else?		The world will survive more than one SOTU response.  I look forward to remarks by Harris,  Abrams, AND Bernie.  They're all on the same side, bottom line
@maramcewin @MyGrannyTheGeek Your post re Bernie Sanders is unfair and inaccurate.  The OTHER SIDE OF TRUMP? You think that fair?		He's no saint.  But his heart and integrity are unimpeachable.

@corkerytj @realDonaldTrump Thomas, it is bad form to stuff lies into your opponent's mouths		No Democrat favors "open borders". That is a lie. Stop it		Business owners who exploit undocumented folks are Republican members of the Chamber of Commerce in great bulk, not Dems		Lying about that sucks too, fyi
@realDonaldTrump That is an unusually GROSS LIE, DONALD TRUMP,  even by your more than 8,000 strong and growing record of lying to the public.		There is no shred of evidence that your cruel inhumane separation policy deters anyone at all. You just make everything much worse doing that		Stop it!

@realDonaldTrump You gave Kim Jong-un a spot with you on the world stage,  giving the NK facist the global status he craves - and you got nothing for it.		All previous presidents were smart not to hand NK recognition without real concessions from them first.  Too bad you're not that smart
@realDonaldTrump Then why is Russia building a nuclear plant in North Korea?		US national security said that nothing's different - NK has nukes, plans to keep them, and they have hidden sites where you have no clue what's going on inside.

With those values,  he is nothing near a Democrat politically.   As @rosebeckley noted,  he sounds and smells exactly like a "cut my taxes/cut your services" Republican.		@NBCNews , @CBS, @ABC, @CNN ....  quit referring to him as a Democrat, claiming our Party is divided.   3/4
