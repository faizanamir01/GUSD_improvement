@ImMcChubby @bill4080 @KaitMarieox @bridgetbhc @ktullymcmanus Cars are required to have safety features such as ABS, traction, airbags, seat belts, padded dash, head restraints, safety glass, crash worthiness etc, etc. Owner must pass a ability to control test. Insurance. Inspections are required periodically.

@ImMcChubby @KaitMarieox @bridgetbhc @ktullymcmanus Nope don't own one. But sure let's go back to wild west by all means. Have you compared death rates per 100,000 in gun friendly versus not?
@ImMcChubby @KaitMarieox @bridgetbhc @ktullymcmanus Yes I have, shot an m60. Is that truck yours or mom's?
@ImMcChubby @KaitMarieox @bridgetbhc @ktullymcmanus Overcoming tyranny, oh that's a good one. Good luck firing at an airplane that launches missiles to you from miles away. Oh by the way all that still involves shredding people.
@KaitMarieox @bridgetbhc @ktullymcmanus Ok so you are an expert on guns. Tell me, dynamite can be used to make way for roads and basements for big buildings etc. What other use does a gun have besides shredding people?
@Shawn_2711 @dbongino Once upon a Time, a man loses 8 billion of other people's money (that we know of). Yet his networth is still 3.1 billion. What better way than give back to those people by creating a 1800+ mile concrete project and a tax cut deal.
@Battalion111 @dbongino You own a home? What is a certificate of occupancy inspection? Or how about a building department inspection?
@PShreckhise @dbongino Have any children Gramps? Green crap you speak of will hit them the hardest. Try googling or youtubing Beijing and calcutta air. Or yeah also look up NYC 1970s. https://t.co/HLwedgkiHw
@dbongino I spend so much time	Believing all the lies	To keep the dream alive	Now it makes me sad	It makes me mad at truth	For loving what was you		Eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)	Eyes without a face, got no human grace your eyes without a face
@charliekirk11 Absolutely untrue. If you have an addict sibling a) you pretend everything is ok b) keep quiet c) tell them and get help.	Guess what we are doing. Yup and that's because we love this country just like because you love the sibling.😉😎
@chuckwoolery In United States approximate wealth distribution is 90-10. Logically 10 belongs to working class. That means actual cost of plan is 10% of the 94 trillion. Rest is all profit to elite. 10% of 94T is 9.4T. YW.
@GOP Go bold? Dont You mean publicity stunt gotten way out of hand?
@LauraKn62806092 @charliekirk11 Yeah too busy throwing people's lives into chaos to get contracts for people he owes money to. (Aka wall) Riiiiiiiiggggghhhhtttttt.
@GOPChairwoman Here we go again with butting into affairs of other nations. Sending aid is fine, but let's stay out of forcing politics. Hey we didn't like the bots right, so what are we doing?
@LauraKn62806092 @charliekirk11 Aha. is that why we are paying for his golf trips? Total so far is 73 million dollars. Total cost of shutdown: 4+ billion. I don't think you understand the meaning of the word: care.
@charliekirk11 Wow how silly, seems to think world revolves around a guy who has less money than he borrowed and lost. (3.1 B net worth versus 8-9 B lost). He seems to be doing a good job on his own with other people's money
@CJTS7006 Thanks goodnight 💤
@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 @vfong @pelosi @TomSteyer Coincidentally the networth is about 30% of his losses (known ). Population that voted for him is 19% overall. What could really be hiding in those tax returns, I wonder.
@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 @vfong @pelosi @TomSteyer Lost about 8-9 billion of other people's money that we know of and has a networth of 3.1B. what he basically has is his pops name which gets him money from creditors correct? You were saying something about a basement and welfare?
@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 @vfong @pelosi @TomSteyer Ok looks like I got that wrong about the 98% rate. No apologies since I have amassed many names here. Now let's see how much $.		1991- Taj 3 B loss	916 M loss personal		1992 1.4 B		2004 - 1.8 B	2009 - 1 .2 B	Reported net worth 2018 3.1B

@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 @vfong @pelosi @TomSteyer According to what I can find, only a third of his ventures worked out. That's a little over 33%? Where do you hear these stats, inforwars maybe?
@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 National debt 2016: 19.5 trilion	                         2019: 22+ trillion	Biggest change: tax code.	Who benefits?	Who pays for all that interest?
@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 @vfong @pelosi @TomSteyer I see, so apprentice star files for bankruptcy for 1.8 billion. Stiffed students for" real estate " courses. Stiffs contractors. Would that be embezzlement or just good business practices?
@Poly_Junky @CJTS7006 @charliekirk11 I guess that's why CA is the world's 5th largest economy.

@Franklin_Graham @realDonaldTrump Actually pastor what he won by was an archaic system called electoral college in place because of slavery and because founders didn't trust direct democracy. But then you knew that right?

@SebGorka @AOC 25000 high paying jobs. In other words not for the middle class.
@charliekirk11 @BernieSanders Nobody said anything about abolishing millionaires. Instead of 90%-10% ratio, we will settle for 50-50. That is 50% of wealth is owned by 10% of population while other 50% wealth is owned by the 90% of population. Fair enough?

@GOPChairwoman All ya all speaking so highly of a Stockholm situation, why is it that your supreme leader can't just bring it as a bill and vote on it? Besides his highness already received 1.6 billion for it. ( Spituinggg)
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump They were holding a fundraiser stupid, something they shouldn't have to do if we gave them humanitarian aid like Florida got.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump But not healthcare for those dying? How compassionate.
@charliekirk11 They already gave 21.5 billion for border security + 1.6 billion for the wall, you clueless dipshit.
@senatemajldr Are you worried about your wife getting fired sir? Because you sound like a scared high school kid. All three branches are peers remember that? Checks and balances remember that? You don't need a bathroom pass from your supreme leader to do your job.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump 21.5 billion already given for border security. Dunning-Kruger in chief asked for 1.6 more for wall. They gave it. Dk came back and said 5.7. this is where the standoff is. No explanation for how the 5.7 will be spent. So all of U empathyless pretenders STFU.
@SandraTXAS @God_USA_Trump Tell me something. If we add up the corporate welfare, will it be more or less than we spend on so called illegals? How about all the corporate workers who are  paid meager wages who depend on welfare because of it? Can you figure it for us?

@senatemajldr Brazil is laughing at us. Just like the steam engine, pure capitalism's prime time is approaching the end. You are just kicking a tired horse now. It's time to look towards Japan, denmark, Australia etc.
@senatemajldr  it's time to put aside differences and put the country first. Holding your own citizens hostage is not negotiations. It's being bullyish, arrogant and I, the jury. It's easy to destroy but super hard to build. Soybean market is lost.
@senatemajldr remember why the Pilgrim braved an unknown seas in basically a plank of wood with a sail? *Freedom* At this rate, all will turn into basically tyranny. It means the whole country will be a prison with a warden. Have you no vision at all sir?

@GOP Those of you screaming socialism, please explain how car insurance works when you file a claim and whose money pays for it.
@charliekirk11 That three billion is really in rubles or dollars?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I didn't see any words relating to quality jobs.
@charliekirk11 Here is an idea. Make corporations and churches pay their fair share of taxes. Eliminate all corporate welfare. Then we can talk about who is really a burden to the system.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump She lost the election due to a bunch of rural states with out of reality unedumacated people.

@charliekirk11 Pro life and blocking healthcare is not logical.	History says Republican party changed sides.	Perspective is thinking global not walls.	Science is not bringing back asbestos.	Reason is not pushing divisionism.	Facts is not breathbutt, faux news or icky wars.	Math is not tax cuts
@StephenMilIer The fact that golf lover is an insomniac may explain some of the erratic behavior.

@SonyaSmith @LLLolly @larryelder Rich folks don't build anything, they retain ownership and control. That's their skill. Nothing else. They work hard is a myth. Problem with them is they don't know how to share a little. They want to keep everything and make all else live in poverty.
@SonyaSmith @LLLolly @larryelder This concept traces back to dark ages where manual labor was higher priority than skill. Basically this is what religion and slavery is all about. "Without rich man, you are nothing". It's a condescending statement that says you get what I say you do, me the rich person.

@LLLolly @larryelder Sad truth is America has lost ability to have empathy. Hopefully we won't become an authoritarian state because of that. Goodnight.
@LLLolly @larryelder A land becomes a great country by the way it treats the people. Particularly-poor, sick, elderly, women, children, veterans, workforce. Right now we fail in many of those aspects in order to please the rich. Lots of wealthy, military might, walls does not make a land great.
@LLLolly @larryelder Then I would say you lack a basic human quality: empathy. Just like giving birth doesn't make you a mother.
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump For a pastor, you act a lot like a politician.
@LLLolly @larryelder Let me put it in a different way. If an employer makes $ 275 million a day, but his employees are dirt poor, on welfare living in the parking lot, what is that called?
@LLLolly @larryelder You watch a lot of faux news channel don't you? You have it stuck in your mind that socialism means taking everything from rich.

@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump And the 73 million he spent on golf? Income from foreign govt owned property?
@charliekirk11 Hey Charlie, what would we find if we look in Cayman and swiss banks?

@FoxNews @MonicaCrowley @IngrahamAngle Let me correct that for you: not Flint, not Puerto Rico, but where my supporters are.
@GOP Reason for that is excessive cuts to middle class while costs are going way up. 'You people' didn't know how to keep feather plucking the golden goose under control. Congratulations, 'you' are your own enemy.

@BlackSunPMC @starcrosswolf @sabine_durden @KamalaHarris I really am glad that things worked out the way intended. To me though a carjacker's main focus is the car and getting away quickly, so the first thing is get people away from it, in this case the kids and woman. Hanging around in a crowd is not.
@BlackSunPMC @starcrosswolf @sabine_durden @KamalaHarris Ok he has a gun, you have one, and what if a police officer enters scene at the moment you fired? How does he decide who's who?
@BlackSunPMC @starcrosswolf @sabine_durden @KamalaHarris Ok so crowded parking lot, how did you ID the perpetrator and his intentions?
@GovMikeHuckabee All due respect sir, the man is doing his job, not playing golf. Benghazi cost: 8 million, 2.5 years, zero indictments. Let the man finish his job. Right now our country is nothing more than a puppy mudbogging in a puddle.
@BlackSunPMC @starcrosswolf @sabine_durden @KamalaHarris That's commendable sir, saving a life. tell us about scenario with three gunfights. The carjacker scenario, how many bystanders?
@BlackSunPMC @starcrosswolf @sabine_durden @KamalaHarris No I haven't, I'm guessing you have. What is the reason you started shooting?

@bonniemurphy @God_USA_Trump If that's what's called free stuff, so is  a subsidy, profit, an insurance claim, use of public property such as a road, research by government, utilities delivery and so on...... A lot of the medicine research  tax payer funded by the way.

@KaitMarieox Its sad that we first recognize plastic waste as a threat to humanity before we recognize the need for gun regulation. Take all the time you need to ponder.
@FoxNews We take things from the rest of the world by force or manipulation. We are either directly or indirectly responsible for poverty and refugees. Grow some humanity.
@wwmguy @AnnCoulter You fought for this country sir, you have my utmost respect for having bigger, hairier kohones than me or the president. But you didn't fight for just one group, you fought for the whole country correct?
@wwmguy @AnnCoulter So please, tell me then what a subsidy is, profit is, an overseas account is and emoluments clause is. What is the cause of poverty is.
@wwmguy @AnnCoulter Retired huh? How do you think your benefits are now paid? You may need to remove your glasses once in a while sir.
Electoral college overhaul: add all 4 yrs income from states in taxes to federal government after all subsidies etc are substracted. All who take more than they pay are disqualified from having votes. Remaining states get a vote based on taxes  percentage.
@Cernovich  https://t.co/V40ihXOizu
@charliekirk11  https://t.co/m0gmbv48Pa
@FoxNews Charge traffic tickets by a percentage of income. People such as Warren Buffett, Jeff bezos, bill gates should pay 10% of their wealth toward worker benefits, education and healthcare. Eliminate all corporate money in politics.
@FoxNews Cap CEO pay at 16 to 1 worker. Corporate tax 50% or more. Close all tax loopholes that facilitate over seas money hoarding. Priviledge tax for property transactions worth over 1 million. Higher taxes for wealthy neighborhoods and waterfront exclusive.
@JoyceMeyer  https://t.co/WAuzPPunzV
@FoxNews Instead of giving tax cuts to people who don't need it, reinvest in the country for jobs and tax income. Go back to 50% tax bracket for people earning 250000 or more, repeal the social security earning cap.
@RealJamesWoods  https://t.co/ubRepi6EEX
@BryanJFischer @lawcrimenews OJ is a fine husband I hear.
@AnnCoulter So let me get this straight. Healthcare for sick, low cost education, job training, clean air, well maintained infrastructure, clean water, protection for elderly, feeble and living wage is wrecking the country? I see.
@DannyTarkanian @SusieLeeNV So please tell us why the deficit is over 1 trillion, unemployment is over 4% and who pays all that interest on the deficit to china, Ireland and Brazil? Whole picture please.

@Cernovich So how is the unemployment and deficit? Up or down?
@ggreenwald @Cernovich Oh? I thought you didn't want too much government intervention.

@BoycottBertha @campbosco Crook Obama is my cue to leave. Goodnight.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha Looks like you finally hit the point.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha That question was for the person with the machine in profile pic.
@BoycottBertha @campbosco Ok then just tell me the difference between socialism and capitalism. Should be simple for you.
@BoycottBertha @campbosco You still haven't answered my question about the boring machine.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha So you are saying being sick is does not concern welfare?
@campbosco @BoycottBertha I do understand the competition part, but letting the market decide is how we ended up in 2008.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha Do you drive? Do you think companies will add emission controls on their own? How about safety features like ABS, traction, airbags, crumple zones? Nope, only because they have to. Like it or not government is the reason we have them.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha You see that welfare part? Do you think less regulation will achieve that? https://t.co/a16tCBLfib
@campbosco @BoycottBertha This is where the haze is. Remember I started out saying hybrid? Taking good parts of both. Right now we have extreme capitalism where 1 percent controls more than  80%. That's not a problem for you? Where is the competition in that?
@campbosco @BoycottBertha Wow they did a good job on you. have you read the preamble yet?
@campbosco @BoycottBertha No matter how you spin it teach, bottom line is there is only so much room at the top. Whole issue is capitalism gladly takes 750 from a sick person that only takes few dollars to produce. Takes subsidies but don't want to pay taxes. It knows no bounds.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha 😂😂😂😂 ok then teach have a nice day.
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 Do you live in city or in an airstream?
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 So you are ok with paying taxes on money you put into social security when old?
@codycr6 @KaitMarieox Oh I see, are you saying we can get rid of the categories that kill most altogether,  keep just rifles? That does make sense.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha Then let me bring you up to speed, teach. capitalism is profit. Profit is taking something from someone else while doing nothing for it, and making a collection of it. Capitalism cannot exist without poverty. It's the opposite end of communism. Extremities.
@campbosco @BoycottBertha Ok then old person, please explain to me the basis of capitalism.
@EdKrassen Except he is in way over his head now and everyone in the wagon is playing him for the guinea pig. Does he have a clue?
@JMichaelWaller @Cernovich Lol you are actually saying people with money should receive attention first.
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 Reagan reduced taxes on top earners from 70% to 50% in 1981. 50-28 in 1986. Guess how he made up for the lost revenue? By taxing social security. Still think rich folks don't get freebies?
@BoycottBertha That giant boring machine in your picture, how was it financed, please tell us.
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 See that 'doesn't matter to me' line? That's a clue to the level of your brainwashed thinking. Good luck with your future ventures.
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 A corporate subsidy is money paid out from taxes. https://t.co/9BWRuLcmqQ
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 You are type of naive person the reason 1 percent exists. Since you are already convinced that democratic socialism can't work, please do stop using roads, bridges, dams, sewer, airports, public transportation etc.
@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 Please do check your bank account balance to determine which of the trump supporter you are. Rich or brainwashed. Paul Ryan himself said 450k is middle class. Which means anyone making less is not under consideration of the system.
@PittsburghGal1 @BoydCrowder15 @Ocasio2018 If you file an insurance claim, whose money are you using? Come on seriously.
@PittsburghGal1 @BoydCrowder15 @Ocasio2018 ?? What is taxes??

@BoydCrowder15 @PittsburghGal1 @Ocasio2018 Please explain why funding is not lacking?
@PittsburghGal1 @BoydCrowder15 @Ocasio2018 You are right, that is why democratic is in front of it. It is basically a mixture of capitalism and socialism. Just like porn can teach you to practice pull out which heightens repetitive pleasure with a single partner. Nobody is looking for extremity.
RT @Mikel_Jollett: Let's just cut the shit. 		If you think health care and education are "socialist" then so are:		Police departments	Fire…
@PittsburghGal1 @BoydCrowder15 @Ocasio2018 The socialism you speak of in Venezuela is actually a failed version of communism that gave too much subsidies based on oil income. But we liberals are actually looking at countries like Canada, sweden, Japan.... You seem to not see the difference.
@Thomashines93 @Ocasio2018 Nothing is free in socialism or not. Someone has to pay. Like we pay for certain golf trips. We pay for bankruptcies and deficit. Its Like car insurance. Difference is who has to start paying in socialism versus capitalism.
@jovaneyashman @Ocasio2018 You just described capitalism.
@beta420 @Ocasio2018 Your profile picture explains everything.
@BoydCrowder15 @Ocasio2018 Let me translate that for you into plain English: profit margin is way too thin with socialism. You are welcome.
@WeSupport45 @Ocasio2018 @SenSanders Communism: everything is owned by state	Socialism: everything is owned collectively. Less profit, more social well being.	Capitalism: 1 percent owns, controls everything. divisionism and distraction is standard operating procedure.
@BryanJFischer Why do you mention a specific group sir? For example I can think of Nazi sympathizers. Why no mention of that?
@RealCandaceO @ivanka If it really happened why wait 500 days? And how about the father?
@senjudiciary @ChuckGrassley We tax payers fund golf trips, kerosene for airfaux 1, secret service,  subsidies, interest payments on deficit and defense. What's the question again?
@codycr6 @KaitMarieox Oh sorry, thanks for clarifying that. I'm sure death by handguns are no big deal.

@charliekirk11 Why are there 50 homeless shelters in lemont Illinois, with 16k population sir? 😶
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump Ever heard of ladders and tunnels? Relatively speaking whole purpose is to create a revenue machine for people involved in building it. Its not for what you think it is. Like wars are.
@GOP If it's working so well sir, why does the deficit keep rising?
@larryelder you people are really good at pairing people with jobs. Rats? Get a person who knows about population control. Not a business man.

@NBCNews Charrrrrrrrrrrrge. What are we in 1620?
@KaitMarieox @BernieSanders @Ocasio2018 Please explain to me the difference between: socialism, fascism, communism and capitalism (aka profiteerism)

@charliekirk11 All you have to do is bring back 70%  tax rate for rich, like before 1980. Space shuttle program started in 1972. What major projects have we started after 1980 sir? Those poor is the reason we have ultra rich.

@marklutchman Dude seriously? Queen of England is symbolic. Besides that she is 92 years old. Treating an old woman respectfully is called bowing? Yikes. Can you people please learn to hug each other.😕
@Cernovich And you sir can't protect young boys from priests. Tell me again who are the bad people?
@RyanAFournier I get your point but then again we are not the ones going to a Starbucks with rifle and glocks. Might you be expecting to fight the resistance there?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Hey Ted, you might as well talk to a tree, at least tree will give you oxygen.
@KaitMarieox I always hear you people defending 2A in case of tyranny. But curiously it is also you people pushing one side into power which will help form a tyrannical government. Hmmm.
@mikeys327 @deathdragon007 @NRA @realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/NzdGTgtmzV
@mikeys327 @deathdragon007 @NRA @realDonaldTrump Well I sure do hope I'm wrong for once young man. But it's upto people like you to make sure it doesn't happen and nobody can tell you which video game to play. We sometimes take things like that for granted.
@mikeys327 @deathdragon007 @NRA @realDonaldTrump How do you think they got their start? By convincing a group of people to turn on the other. If you think it can't happen here, pay attention to how some groups are turning against others. Delusional or Keen eyed? I already went 51 nice years, and you?
@deathdragon007 @mikeys327 @NRA @realDonaldTrump I'm glad it hit you because living with a dictator is not going to be a joke, I guarantee you. If you need first hand experience, just visit Otto wambier's grave.
@MarkSimoneNY Please check his bank account and computer for bitcoins first.
@ABC Well then, did somebody say irony?
@deathdragon007 @mikeys327 @NRA @realDonaldTrump Please practice rubber or pull out at all times. Please do not practice direct deposit at any time for the sake of mankind.
@mikeys327 @deathdragon007 @NRA @realDonaldTrump Now we know well fed people can't even use Google correctly. Please set course for re-entry back to mother Earth. Yikes. https://t.co/NrbdT9kHwL
@RealJamesWoods Why don't you ask the father bush?
@NRA @realDonaldTrump You people make me laugh. We need #2 in case of a tyrannical government comes for us. Helps form a tyrannical government by pushing one side into power at the same time.
@kelliwardaz @USATODAY Why do you think that these people are trying to come here doc? Could it be because someone took everything in their country out and left nothing behind?
@BryanJFischer Do you mean the time mitchy was stalling for 8 months or other times he was being bullied?
@RealJamesWoods Are you that afraid of women Mr. Woody? Perhaps you should practice with a plastic puffy and some slippery liquid.
@charliekirk11 Look up how many people needs to be in poverty for McDonald's CEO to make millions. Same with Walmart Amazon. What would you call that?
@RealCandaceO Problems sweetheart are this: there will be too much of one side in power. No half and half. Then there is religion trying to creep into politics. Remember #2? Well this is how tyranny gets started, in case you were not paying attention.
@sahilkapur Sahil, conciliatory my deep tanned hairy brown a$$. He stalled for 8 months. What the hell are you talking about?
@business Thieve's mother won't give him up either. Just saying.
@replouiegohmert How's that saying go: drowning people will even grab straws right?
@Imamofpeace It's 2018 and some women just now beginning to drive. Hmmm.
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Pastor, would you like to post your churche's financials here? How much of it actually went to help people?
@GOP Then again DNA testing was not required either.
@WhiteHouse @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump Like how we are enforcing the sanctions?
@HouseGOP Why aren't you mentioning the higher interest payments to china and Brazil because of this?
@dbongino If you mean forest fire on dead vegetation?
@Cernovich You forgot about repubics afraid of NRA,  blocking everything. Also mega money wasted on things like benghazi.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You mean advance business freedom don't you sir?
@RealAlexJones Also Alexa: what is manifest destiny? A name invented to legitimatize land stealing.
@ROHLL5 @God_USA_Trump  https://t.co/nTZacjAX86
@mitchellvii How much was the Benghazi with zero indictments? I'm senile sometimes, refresh my memory.
@DonaldJTrumpJr How is that clearance coming along sir?
@GOP Kind of like Mitch the taiwanese puffy lover obstructing for 8 months?
@Cernovich Fantas(y)tic logic
@CRSvensson @NWB78 @RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Alright, tell me all the 'legal' means of entering this country. One I know is called EB-5 visa which requires a minimum of 1 million dollars 'investment'
@SteveSGoddard @God_USA_Trump Are you serious? Please look at ice chunks melting videos in YouTube and guess the size of the ice. Please do not spread illiteracy about our planet for profit. Thank you.
@CRSvensson @NWB78 @RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What you describe as defying is commonly known as vigilantism.
@CRSvensson @NWB78 @RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So why exactly do you think that these people left everything they know and go to a foreign land?
@CRSvensson @NWB78 @RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sarcasm for swastika
@LamNewbie @BreitbartNews I don't know about you, but when I was in HS back in 1984, it was literally in books that's the role we wanted to play. Our population is 5% of the world, but we use more than 25% of all resources. Nothing wrong with giving back.
@amandacarpenter Can you turn the back truck around and run by me again? If you are accepting Russians are involved, how do you know the election results are legitimate? What is the reason that they put all that effort in the first place? Just to leave crop marks??
@RudyGiuliani I don't follow your logic sir. If the Russians are involved, how do you know the election results are an accurate reflection of American people's choice?
@NWB78 @CRSvensson @RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Method to these pardons should concern you. They are issued to people who ignore the law. Kind of how rolling zz got it's start way back in 1940's
@NWB78 @CRSvensson @RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Backup the truck. So you are saying, the man was found guilty of not following the law that he is supposed to be upholding, cool to have a free pass?
@RealSheriffJoe @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You mean gratitude for the pardon sir?
@dbongino When you say police-state, is that like Mike pence wanting to run state -media like er you know North Korea?
@CBSNews @POTUS Can anyone tell me what EB-5 visa is?
@SenateGOP Don't you mean when confirmed by Republicans?
@BreitbartNews I thought people like him pick up arms to defend those are not able to defend themselves. I guess that's why we pardoned domestic terrorists?
@IAmBritishreal @POTUS Well I guess small balloons are abundant across pond too.
@charliekirk11 Sir, don't you mean love of money versus love of America? Perhaps you think it's one and the same. However, it's not. Just like some people confuse lust for love.

@PrisonPlanet you mean private companies are doing better job of lawmakers?
@Cernovich Who started that?
@charliekirk11 But you forgot about company making the machines and people writing the software for them
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov Where did you get that from Breitbart or Fox noise?
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov So please, then tell me what is the purpose of the rules?
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov Sure like we plow through sovereign land of the natives for dinosaur juice?
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov Is that the same reasoning behind keeping kids behind cages or just watching them get shot? Profiting off misery? Pretending to uphold constitution but suspend rules to take votes?
@HeidiHeitkamp No senator, ya all in capital Hill needs to stop this I only answer to whoever bullcrap. Your state takes farm subsidies? Well who the hell do you think foots that? Think in whole, please. Did I say please?
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov Hit a nerve did I? No amount of reasons doesn't change what it is. Land taken from rightful owners. What you just said is no different than manifest destiny.
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov Of course you don't, language of this land is not English. Lot of you are forgetting the true owners of this country
@nypost You mean the company they say is building backdoors into everything they manufacture? Wow we are getting so smarter everyday.
@WillDavisDBA @God_USA_Trump @OccupyICEPDX @ICEgov Sounds like you are able to speak cherokee fluently, you know the language this land
@axios @AppropsDems Well there is a surprise. Did anyone say NRA contributions?
@WeSupport45 @realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters @ImpeachMaxine Well now we know the reason women couldn't vote until 1920's. They scare the hell out of some people heheheee
@RealCandaceO You have disagreement confused with hate. Hate is openly cheating on wife, letting children go without bath for three months, promoting divisionism and destroying hard built things.
@Cernovich Health, you know the one thing that 50+ bills were written by GOP to block.
@charliekirk11 You forgot unlimited funds and influence on admission
@aaronjcarpenter @RyanAFournier @charliekirk11 @TrumpStudents @TPUSA Why does it always look the same? well fed people banding up to take away from those who don't? Hmmm
@GOP Really? what would you call suspending rules at the floor, dear uphold the constitution party?
@NRATV Tell me sir, you speak of obstructionism. What does suspend rules to take vote on the floor means?
@NRA  https://t.co/tDcOZFxd1g
@charliekirk11 hatred is all you know it seems. We don't hate him, we just don't like to be taken for a ride.

@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Kids die by guns nothing happens with rules. Two people want to be with each other, all kinds of ways to kill it. Have you people never been hugged?
@krassenstein They suspend rules to take votes. The party that upholds the constitution. Lol.
@BuckSexton @SebGorka Really? Then why do you sound urgent?
@JosephJFlynn1 @WeSupport45 @GOP @realDonaldTrump @RealOmarNavarro Hispanos for GOP is like poor people supporting private jet deductions.
@Sean_K_Davis @SebGorka @dbongino @seanhannity @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewsvideo Would you be referring to the american people who disagree with you on profiteerism, two seconds after you said America first, as enemies? Getting harder tell what your patriotism means.
@WeSupport45 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters @ImpeachMaxine She scares you that much like Hillary?
@realDonaldTrump @God_USA_Trump Oh he shook the hands, well okay then.
@Cernovich Is that a PSA from the NRA sir?
@charliekirk11 You are not very smart sir, by your own words, Trump then won by fraud. Do you think at all with that squash lodged in your skull?
@KaitMarieox You do realize those 2020 posters are made in- surprise-surprise-china
@USATODAY What about all that interest we pay to them on the debt?
@RealJamesWoods Don't you mean we only want immigrants with $1 million or more to invest here?
@NBCNews I think he means anyone with $1 million or more are very welcome here to emigrate.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Don't you mean we will suspend the rules for our guy?
@ResistanceNOW77 You are traveling through another dimension. There is a sign post up ahead. Your next stop: the profiteerism.
@TomiLahren Does that include suspending rules at the floor to take votes?
Party that upholds the constitution hard at work. https://t.co/ejqMcFa98X

@BreitbartNews Do you mean to imply that she is your nightmare? Please check definition below https://t.co/dizPbBELgL
@SarahPalinUSA Does grab them by the puffy also qualify?
@joemouawad You do realize you are talking about somebody's mother there right? Do you have one that loves you sir?
@RealAlexJones Also Alexa: That red plastic cup is made possible by Alexander parks, a british inventor.
@SenTedCruz Are you not Cuban sir?
@rising_serpent @God_USA_Trump If you mean taking money from foreign governments while in power, disregard social welfare, increase and reinforce  profit mechanisms and promote divisinism, you are correct sir.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Please tell me what emoluments clause is, delaying an appointment for 8 months is and taking contributions from NRA and  standing idly by while kids die.
@DuszaLukasz That kid is well fed, lives in a nice house, wears nice clothes, nice haircut and lotion. Probably haven't even heard of the word struggle or develop.
@RepDianeBlack @townhallcom A sad reminder of what America has become, take all and fluck all. Monkeys exhibit better empathy.
@AshMcGonigal @RepDianeBlack @townhallcom Nah not gonna happen because that kills profit, just like universal healthcare would kill profiting off misery.
@AndrewCMcCarthy Did you read what you wrote sir? What do you think progressive means? Going back to 1950?
@usminority @God_USA_Trump @adorama Dude aren't you promoting #walkaway? That's divide and conquer/rule at it's best. Hope you realize that a camera is made of more than one part.

@KatiePavlich How many times have you been hungry sweetheart? Or ever slept without heat or AC? Run for your life with fear? You talk big because  you got a silver spoon and a safety cocoon.
@TPCarney @amandacarpenter Don't you mean ability to continuously take from poor?
@HouseGOP And more interest payments to china and Brazil.
@charliekirk11 If you mean: violent rhetoric, coal, 57 environmental rules out, Flint Michigan, Puerto Rico, 50 bills to kill ACA, infrastructure, tariffs, emoluments clause, endless golfing, hooker payments, revolving door at white house, growing indictmens, yes.
@SenateMajLdr Is that why you stalled Obama for 8 months sir?

@bbahorsehotel @justdoingmyjob @realDonaldTrump Good then fix your own stuff without federal grants which come from taxes of large states.
@KatiePavlich Please do describe what the right thing is.
@charliekirk11 Loss of popular vote is still burning you eh?
@chuckwoolery So would getting rid of environmental protections.
@HeidiHeitkamp Please explain this cheating in global trading as you call it.
@SurvivalNat You people never ceases to amaze me. That's literally how insurance works. Please use that butt pocket device other than to watch Fox noise.

@TomiLahren All of ya for life until it turns out to be gay, sick or needs help.

@tea7cher @Franklin_Graham Last I checked, nature is full of tsunamis, mudslides, sinkholes, storms, floods, earthquake etc. Plus everything your body needs is not found in any one place. You need a 75000hp icebreaker to get to 2/3 of all fresh water. Not intelligent.
@stillswaggon @thegoldenpanda7 @RobinCia1 @CuKitz7 @Animal40312470 @Franklin_Graham @ConcernedAmeri2 Oh snap.
@cbeckman53 @Franklin_Graham All he has to do is come down in a shiny new motto Gucci and walk on water. Wine will do too.
@RobinCia1 @Franklin_Graham @ConcernedAmeri2 Why is it that he simply didn't tell them not to be there? He is all knowing after all.
@christinaLW28 @tjpowell2008 @lbroskay @Franklin_Graham If he gave you free will then how can he have a plan for you also? Oh snap.
@CryptoMob @HouseGOP I don't have a problem with them, all they have to do is pay taxes and carry their burden. If they really did, there would be no need for offshore bank accounts. Rich folks enjoy the best of the earth, so they should pay a higher price. Not lower.
@RealCandaceO You look like still has milk breath. All of the things around you that you enjoy are things that others are either making or left behind. You probably think  it's  easy because you probably never experienced any difficulty like hunger. I have.
@CryptoMob @HouseGOP I know you are being sarcastic but just for clarification, rich to poor is a ratio. You have to take it from someone else to be rich. Can't exist any other way.
@akoilinc @HouseGOP Rofl 😂😂😂😋😋

@indycolts1956 @RichNoyes @newsbusters Lol ok then, thanks you too.
@indycolts1956 @RichNoyes @newsbusters Aren't you basically saying it's ok when I do it, but not when someone else is doing the same thing because I now changed what its called? How do you people sleep?
@indycolts1956 @RichNoyes @newsbusters So you came and settled on someone else's land and it's not illegal immigration?
@indycolts1956 @RichNoyes @newsbusters So please, explain to me the difference between people coming here as you say 500 years ago and illegal immigration.
@indycolts1956 @RichNoyes @newsbusters You seriously think settlers were nice people? Brave yes, nice I don't think so. Now I know this guy was elected.
@indycolts1956 @RichNoyes @newsbusters So right now we want to build a wall and deport all illegal immigration. What makes you think a bunch of people already living here was going to let a bunch of strangers take over the land without any problems?
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Where  do you think the lost revenue from tax cuts will be taken out of?
@charliekirk11 Please tell me about the companies that are forced to go to china. Then tell me how you are going to make them produce something with blindfolds on them. When you are stirring the pot, try using a pair of gloves.

@jojoh888 Does that include ignoring the emoluments clause? You preach justice represented by flag, yet people in Detroit are drinking contaminated water. 67 environment rules are on the way out. 50+ bills to kill ACA. Does selective patriotism ring a bell?
@RealJamesWoods Dude what happened to you? I (used to ) love your movies. Now you are spreading anti humanism. Why? Who do you think made you rich?
There is a folk saying in my Homeland. You can 1 or 2 feathers off the golden goose. Can get away with even 5. Try taking 5 or more and the goose will bite you and never come back. Hint to all rich folks who don't want to pay taxes and get rich off misery.

@MarcusFHollow4y @KaitMarieox I take active shooter classes for work premises. Average for most Mass shootings, time is 2 minutes or less. You can't shoot 80 people in under two minutes with a gun designed to hold only 6 bullets. Loading time allows people to scramble and/or fight back.
@MarcusFHollow4y @KaitMarieox Thank you for the clarification of differences. Here is the point: most people can pull the trigger continuously for around 40-50 times per minute. 40-50 dead, reload, assuming barrel is not warped 40 more. 80-100 under 2m. We just want regulation into that.
@KaitMarieox Please tell me how to attach a 100 round clip to a pistol. https://t.co/3HwleRaL80

@charliekirk11 Lol you mean people who want regulation of guns. Yes we want control, no we didn't say take it from trained people.
@RealCandaceO Don't you mean the leader of the minority? Majority of us voted for the smart woman. 2.9 million more votes in fact.
@charliekirk11 And where did you get these statistics sir, your friend circle and two people walking down the street perhaps?
@Lyt4X5Dcli7lYTP Are you sure about that ma'am? How did you come to conclude who the cronies are? Car companies for example, will bash another company they want to surpass and/or crush. Any chance that's happening here?
@GOP Official Trump store huh? What happened to the emoluments clause?
@KaitMarieox Please tell me how kids dying from gun violence is justice that the blue in flag stands for.

@YoungDems4Trump Don't you really mean you are happy that a woman is not president?
@RealAlexJones Of course we are happy to take their resources, but not help them. How humanitarian.
@BryanJFischer Jesus was virgin born as your good book says. Since no direct deposit from a male was involved, Jesus only has x chromosome. Therefore Jesus is born a girl and lived as a man. Which means Jesus is trans and should use the girls bathroom, beard and all.

@KaitMarieox 1. Disagreeing isn't harrassment or threatening. 2. Free speech is #1 remember? 3. Nobody wants to confiscate all your precious toys. We just want access restricted and regulated like you can't have a car before 16. Not unreasonable right?
@charliekirk11 You just called a group of  Americans who disagree with your profiteerism enemies. Is that a correct observation sir?
@SecretaryCarson @ACUConservative Translation: profit maximizers are working nicely.
@HouseGOP When will ivanka Trump clothing line be produced entirely in America sir?
@DLHay @Franco85886695 @KaitMarieox Agreed, and you are right it is two different things. Just for clarification, people like myself are not calling for a communist country. What we actually want is democratic socialism. It simply calls for reduced emphasis on profit and more emphasis on social well being.
@PrisonPlanet If a person drives drunk, high, erratic and at high speed= I say soon crash. But you are saying hey person still in control. If you can't see it coming, it will be too late to do anything. Just saying.
@Franco85886695 @KaitMarieox Socialism and communism is not one and the same. America already has socialism. Guess what interstate highway system is? https://t.co/qJiuzKV3gg

@jpinkglasses @Linda_Hali There in lies the basic predicament of mainstream America. Which ' individual' do we follow and how do we decide? Because you are saying nationalism right? So that implies all following one.
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump The disconnect you mention probably is the basic difference in how you perceive empathy vesus how i perceive empathy.
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump Let me ask you a bit of history. Can you tell me when and where the largest genocide occurred?
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump Latter, what you think is the serious issue?
@jpinkglasses @Linda_Hali Oh I see. So you are saying  that Justice is what the dominating party decides?

@jpinkglasses @SusieM97111274 May I ask why you use the term blue?
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump Not like computers? Brain uses detectable electrical pulses, different regions for different tasks, muscles are activated by electrical pulses sent by brain, oh and yes we do compute.
@jpinkglasses @TLCampb3 @marklutchman Why shouldn't the guns be regulated? Let's allow anybody to fly anything they want in the sky while you are below. How well do you think that will work?
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump There is your problem: no idea how your life is better than a pilgrim on a covered wagon smelling horse crap on the way to work.
@jpinkglasses @Linda_Hali Please define Justice for me.
@jpinkglasses @BryanJFischer Ok then please correct me
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump Instincts are like bios in a motherboard. Bios code is much simpler than the operating system. However Motherboard cannot function  without it. Renders the entire computer  useless.
@jpinkglasses @063_lisa @God_USA_Trump Got polio no? Thank the eastern European decendant. Got computers? thank the gay atheist British guy. Mount Rushmore - sculpted by Danish decendant. Statue of liberty is sculpted by french guy after a Muslim woman. Things we seem to be forgetting.
