@mayawiley @womensmarch I don’t disagree. I’m embarrassed and angry someone would use an African-American like Meadows did. It’s like a slave Master strutting out a slave and make them say they like what they do.

@LynnePatton you said you were “proud of defending Trump” to @Yamiche yes? Let me correct the record: you were USED to defend Trump. A minority being an associate of a racist doesn’t in anyway nullify the person’s status as a racist. https://t.co/kDhfvIPouL
I am PISSED about this. https://t.co/ElkMvvhh76
The fact is that color is seen. Otherwise he wouldn’t make the derogatory remark about African countries. Also it would be nice if she could answer how many black employees there are in Trump org. https://t.co/5w6LxsQyLL
Cohen brought up a point that @LynnePatton WOEFULLY failed to answer. How many black employees are there at the Trump organization. 	Please tell us Lynne. How many black employees are there in Trump org? https://t.co/Jt1aFXNQ5t
They just quoted a filing in which Trump was called an unindicted co-conspirator. 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/zPHwZe0qQJ

@HieronymusMcG @HieronymusMcG right. 	For all we know his phone was taken and someone was in Prague in his place or there was another Cohen there.
I disagree with Ken Dilanian the Russian collusion investigation took a blow due to Cohen saying he “Never went to Prague” and “Not aware of Russian collusion”. He was aware of DNC hacked emails and said Trump would go to any extent to win.

@KFILE @yashar They’re both horrible.
@girlsreallyrule @mattgaetz He was “testing” Cohen. Ya know, the way you have a husband defending mariticide by saying “I wasn’t trying to stab her to death; I was testing the kitchen knife to see if it was sharp. Damn shame my wife didn’t come out okay though.”
@mattgaetz 	You can join him in prison FYI. People in congress aren’t protected from being indicted. https://t.co/HsJ2LafFac

Phew and I am done. These are the Q’s at top of my head I strongly recommend being asked at Wednesday’s hearing.
25/End 	Q30: Did Trump org lobby U.S allies or U.S adversaries to stay at their hotel in exchange for foreign policy favors?
24/ Q29: Has Trump org ever tried to bribe officials in NY to ignore their tax violations? Has Trump org used National Enquirer to collect blackmail on law enforcement to avoid trouble?
23/Q27: To the best of your knowledge are you aware of Trump partaking in crimes like Robert Kraft owner of the Patriots; soliciting sex at undercover brothels? 	Q28: Does Trump know about the prior criminal of the people (like Manafort, Gates) before hiring them?
22/Q26: Are NDAs used by Trump org also meant to prevent employees from speaking about illegalities like falsifying undocumented workers papers? Have undocumented workers at Trump properties also signed NDAs?
21/ Q25: Recalling every piece of information related to individual investigation of DT and speaking in a general sense would you say that Donald Trump is not working on behalf of the American people?
20/Q23: Currently, Trump has plunged America into a trade war with China and put tariffs on U.S allies. Would you say this is similar to the shakedown negotiating tactics used when running Trump org?	Q24: Did the Trump family signal they would use presidency to enrich itself?
19/Q22: In a biography by a former Trump associate, Trump talks about hating black workers counting his money and calls Blacks “lazy”. Before 2018 midterms you said he used the “****holes” about places run by African Americans. Just verifying , you consider DT racist?
18/Q20: Based on the man you used to work for would you say his non-response to Saudi Arabian government dismembering a journalist is an internalization of the business relationship?	Q21: Prior to his presidency did Trump say he would still stay in touch with his business?
17/Q19: @AnibalRomeroLaw the lawyer for Undocumented workers of Trump golf properties called the Trump organization a “criminal enterprise”. Do you agree that assessment?
16/Q18: Early last year the Trump tower in Panama was closed down due to controversy over organized crime using the hotel to launder money. Are the Trump towers in NY or D.C being used to do the same? Also did the Trump org and DT know about this?
15/Q17: Has Trump regularly paid hush money to women he has had relations with?
14/Q16: Has anyone in Trump’s circle reached out and made threats to you or your family?
13/Q15: After the search warrant conducted by FBI last year on your office+hotel Trump called it “An attack on our country.” Was his response because they were beneficial in Campaign finance probe, NY tax crimes, Russia probe or all three?
12/Q14: Two wks ago House Oversight cmte notified WH that Trump lawyers Sheri Dillon and Stefan Passantino provided false statements. Besides yourself, has Trump used atty-client privilege to conceal fraud or have his lawyers lie on his behalf?
11/Q13: The day the FBI carried out a search warrant on your office and hotel Trump called you. In that call did he promise you a pardon?
11/Q12: The day the FBI carried out a search warrant on your office and hotel Trump called you. In that call did he promise you a pardon?
10/Q12: On January 23rd @DonnyDeutsch on @DeadlineWH said that he called you after Trump made his inflammatory threats about your father-in-law. Recount the events of that day please?
9/ Q11: Along with the recently closed Trump foundation are there any other charities that had its money funneled to personally enrich the Trump family?
8/ Q10: An @nytimes article back in October (https://t.co/jeTJ0Y8Czv) gave an overwhelmingly detailed account of Donald Trump’s violation of NY tax laws via tax dodging. Is DT still doing this and has his children(Don jr, Eric and Ivanka) engaged in the same misconduct?
7/ Q9: Based on the man you know, do you think he would hesitate to use the Natl Enquirer to dig up dirt on Dems or Repubs in congress? Did he ever hint he wanted to do so prior or during presidency?
6/ Q8: In an article from the @thedailybeast (https://t.co/eeEjPcvhey) It said that Kushner took over your job of serving as a liaison to the National Enquirer. Can you confirm this?
5/ Q6: Donald Trump during his presidency has made threats against Democrats. Do you have documents showing he did the same using individuals (other than yourself) to do this?	Q7: Trump has been called a mob boss for calling you “a rat”. Based on Trump org practices do you agree?
4/ Q5: Around the beginning of his presidency Trump demanded loyalty from former FBI Comey. Is the demand of loyalty from Trump your former boss’s way of doing things no matter how unethical or illegal? Is it the norm in Trump org?
3/ Q3: Trump has repeatedly said he has no business or investments in Russia. When Congress subpoenas his tax returns will it show otherwise? 	Q4: Has Trump’s business relationship w/Saudi govt factored into inaction against MBS for WaPo journalist murder?
3/ Q3: Despite Trump’s racist and inflammatory language against immigrants he hires undocumented workers. Have you seen first-hand account of him denigrating then? Also based on your decade long relationship would you call Donald Trump a racist?
2/ Q2: According to articles from the  Washingtonpost Trump golf properties hired undocumented immigrants and helped them falsify their documents. How many people in Trump family involved in the business were aware of the practice of falsifying documents?
1/	Q1: Trump’s media ally the Natl Enquirer and it’s chairmen David Pecker aided Trump in hush money payment of 2016 and tried to extort Jeff Bezos 2/7. Has Trump used Natl Enquirer services to blackmail pre presidency and would he use them post-presidency?

@johndbuell @tinydancerz90 @SethAbramson Trump publicly sympathizing Flynn and Manafort comes off as very eyebrow raising.	Even though the former is cooperating he has never referred to him as a “rat” and according to articles behind the scenes Trump has told lawyers he wants to pardon him. That’s very telling.
@swin24 I had a traumatizing experience w/ a cat. The kitty  wiped it’s ass on the carpet after using its litter box. That said, I still find SOME cute.😉
Reminder: Manafort’s lies were about the collusion/conspiracy aspect of Mueller’s investigation. If they weren’t elaborated on in this memo Mueller had a good reason.	 The Mueller memo had a singular purpose: highlighting Manafort’s criminal career. https://t.co/4DR4mY1Nic

To reiterate what @NicolleDWallace said months ago “How the hell did no on Trump campaign use Google search before hiring Manafort?” https://t.co/c115oeXgT3
Trump and Putin’s secret love child is going insane. https://t.co/4LrE9NtKUE
@JoyceWhiteVance To further expand on Joyce’s point: not withstanding the gravity of the “conspiracy to defraud U.S” it’s more practical to recount the Manafort’s exhaustingly long criminal history. That effectively quantifies his nature as a criminal offender.
If @realDonaldTrump pardons Manafort his Wikipedia’s Page should have the alias “Career criminal lover” on it since that’s what prosecutors explicitly call Manafort in the court filings.😂 https://t.co/sTum6V4bOG
@joshgerstein @lrozen @FoxNews Holy shit! Fox News was the sire of a group by a career criminal?😱
Reporters should ask Orwell Huckleberry/Press Sec how Trump has any credibility in condemning criminal acts when his campaign manager is effectively being called an unrepentant criminal. https://t.co/87V95hRcO8
Probably just me— retrospectively speaking, it should be concluded that @realDonaldTrump lacks credibility to call out ANYONE (let alone Maduro, Assad Smollet) for their heinous actions when he hired a CAREER CRIMINAL, like Manafort run his campaign. https://t.co/87V95hRcO8
🖕to everyone who thinks Mueller was obligated to show whether he has evidence of conspiracy/collusion in final filing. This was about Manafort and why he should do hard time in prison.	If want equivalent of the conspiracy charge tho- look no further than Ukraine. https://t.co/O69QLWMrUn

It would be irresponsible of Mueller’s team if they only dropped bits of the conspiracy/collusion and didn’t adequately elaborate on it. It would probably distract direction of the memo if it was listed in the doc. https://t.co/Ng0SeC0Zsd
Just so we’re clear everyone: Mueller’s team needed to clarify why Manafort is a danger to society in the sentencing memo. Adding tidbits about conspiracy/collusion would take up the bulk of the memo. The goal was illustrating depth of Manafort criminality. https://t.co/3x6Bvhrl6D

@kurtbardella @realDonaldTrump Hey @realDonaldTrump 	Care to explain how nearly EVERYONE connected to you is a criminal?
@davidmweissman https://t.co/kUIfCN5TBR
As I mentioned before here’s the conspiracy evidence thus far	•Polling data	•Kilimnik meeting	•Contacting Wikileaks 	•Cohen talking with Russians	It likely Mueller didn’t want to add this to Manafort filing. https://t.co/GzA7WdApT2
@SansMerci86 I like this one even better! Gorgeous and defiant! Two great mixes!
Here’s the collusion aspects in last Mueller filings:	•Polling data (Manafort filing)	•Cigar shop mtg w/Kilimnik (Manafort filing)	•HRC email release timed for maximum damage (cc: Stone filing) 	It likely Mueller didn’t want to release it YET. https://t.co/FsvUPcSfms
Besides the “polling data” bit mentioned by @KenDilanianNBC  	There’s also Mueller’s team rebuttal to Stone saying “I’m not involved” with the GRU officers indicted last summer. In Mueller filing it was said that the emails were “timed”. https://t.co/CnjYrSolwQ
@TeaPainUSA @JoyceWhiteVance Preach!
@mayawiley @sarahkendzior @amjoyshow On another note: the polling data bit reinforces the conspiracy charge towards the Trump team.
My take: Mueller was focused solely on pointing out what an irredeemable criminal Manafort is. This is why they didn’t want to put anything regarding conspiracy in the document. https://t.co/j2RhqhlwGx
@davidmweissman @chrissyteigen Lol good morning Chrissy.
Anyone want to speculate why Russia isn’t mentioned much in Manafort’s document?

@sam_vinograd @realDonaldTrump Roger Stone vouched for Manafort. It wouldn’t surprise me if he knew about his connections to Russia and the way Stone got Trump to pick him was because of his connections to Russian oligarchs.
What Manafort did in Ukraine is no different than what he did with Trump. He sought to install a Putin stooge both here and there. https://t.co/JQebS8RU10
In response to what was stated by legal commentators on @kendisgibson just because Russia wasn’t mentioned in the filing doesn’t mean that there wasn’t any collusion/conspiracy.	There’s Kilimnik and polling data incident. https://t.co/Fyj3BxahZy
@Tom_Winter Awwwww there was nothing new in Manafort doc.😖

@kylegriffin1 https://t.co/ogs5t60xGY
@davidcicilline Please please yes!
@SpicyFiles Agrees with @SpicyFiles 	Avenatti’s insatiable desire to oust Trump is classic  Friedrich Nietzsche “He who fights monsters” example. Mueller would NEVER dabble in these unsavory actions.
@AOC The millionaires owned by billionaires crowd sicking their pets on AOC.
@kim Seems like perfect way to describe @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @LouDobbs #MOBB
Rachel got new documents? https://t.co/7YTeZJeAFh
@Peter_Wehner Fox News is a cancer on America.
@ShimonPro @ShimonPro CNN has staked out Mueller’s grand jury right?
What happened to it going to DOJ next week? https://t.co/MertriIzOY
@kazweida Lol that possible. I betted on a week.
@BrianKarem Ughhhhh sickening. These fools are living in the sunken place.

@MarshallCohen Ouch. She kneecapped the hell out of him.
@lauraapollo @dsamuelsohn @brooklynmarie Everyone keep an eye on that Stone Twitter account.
@AriMelber @TheBeatWithAri 	@MSNBC @CNN @CNNSitRoom 	Here’s the written gag order for Stone!😂 https://t.co/1nT5jeeOAq
@FoxNews 	We already had a cost guard officer prepare for a massive terrorist Attack and yet you’re okay with letting violence instigator like Digenova claim “There’s a civil war coming up.” https://t.co/fWpAXU1KwV
@feministabulous Lol yuppers.
@FoxNews 	This is irresponsible as hell Fox. Simply, IRRESPONSIBLE! https://t.co/FPyHlO0wkj
@mmfa OMFG...
@TheRickWilson https://t.co/WPzCOOBRZB
@eliehonig Follow up on the commentary on @CNNSitRoom 	The cross-examining today was a preview of the trial. ABJ tore him apart.
@eshap @MarkHarrisNC9 Him wanting a new election don’t mean dick to me.
@ZerlinaMaxwell @K_JeanPierre I thank my mother for me being compassionate to everyone regardless if their claim was false.
@PaulLeeTicks @PaulLeeTicks The last time was limited gag order. This is a full one. No talk on her or his case.
@Mimirocah1 @meg_Y12 While I’m disappointed he won’t be sent to jail till trial, the full blown gag order is the best sort of punishment for Stone.
@Mimirocah1 @meg_Y12 At least she made it clear next time she will show no mercy.
@MarshallCohen Stone’s situation is quite laughable. 🤣
RT @politico: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he expects to make a springtime trip to New Hampshire as he weighs a 2020 challenge to Donal…
@azarilaw This is awesome. That judge wrecked the hell out of Stone.
@kylegriffin1 This is just as bad as his bail being revoked. Stone is effectively neutered.
@tribelaw @lrozen This is basically a fate worse than death for Stone.
@SpicyFiles Only a matter of time until he violates this gag order.
@Heidimoconnor @4everNeverTrump @ShimonPro My money is also on a week.
@KatiePhang How’s it feel being neutered by the judge Roger? https://t.co/65vEBSoRmh
@JoyceWhiteVance https://t.co/AdxbpZtkp5
@alexzfinley Okay, this won’t last long then.
Mark Harris should go to jail for election fraud though. https://t.co/LeQeAg91rv
@matthewamiller They’re basically hellspawn of Trump. They have no ability to control himself.
@dcpoll Goddammit!
@4everNeverTrump @ShimonPro Time to make bets on when he’ll violate this gag order.
If he violates this gag order he’s going to jail. Soooo likely by next week he’ll be in jail. https://t.co/a9jZgT59O9
@jimsciutto Geez Jim are calling us stupid? Of course we know what a Celtic cross looks like!
@ananavarro 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
STONE IS BONED! https://t.co/X9YzB5GFO2
@DeadlineWH @MSNBC 	Stone got himself a full blown gag order!!! https://t.co/qhG2z8PCEC
@ZoeTillman Awwwwwwww he’s not going to jail?!?!
@samstein Freaking awesome!
@ShimonPro @DavidLarter Send him to jail!
Send him to jail! https://t.co/1ksLwS6FZo

Of course it does! https://t.co/jVMmJvwYvc
@ryanjreilly Do it Judge! Do ittt!!
@4everNeverTrump @ryanjreilly I’m getting giddy!
@ryanjreilly Oh ho ho ho ho!!
@jonallendc @BradMossEsq lol lol lol she kicking his ass!
@whatiknownow_ @ryanjreilly Are you going to revoke his bail??
@ryanjreilly Of corse he does!
@4everNeverTrump @ryanjreilly Do itttt! Do ittt!!
@ShimonPro Oh boy oh boy oh boy
@ZoeTillman Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
The judge is back! https://t.co/rVYREefYWT
@girlsreallyrule @ZoeTillman Just put him in jail. He lacks self-control.
@ShimonPro Just lol @ the lying on the stand.
@JuddLegum And here I thought Stone squirming was hilarious.
@girlsreallyrule Aye. Stone getting a full blown gag order will prevent him from getting paid until the trial? Okay he can lose his bail and go to jail.
@BradMossEsq The homeless shelter?
@ErikaAndiola More gestapo-esque conduct by ICE.
@girlsreallyrule Time to go to prison Mark Harris.
@ZoeTillman His accumulating money through speaking at political events is irrelevant if he gets a full blown gag order.
@JuddLegum Just wow...if there’s a new election he definitely ain’t gonna be included in it. He can go to prison and @McCreadyForNC can participate in next election.
@Mimirocah1 Glorious watching prosecutors and the judge chop Stone’s testimony to bits.😁
@JuddLegum Lol lol @ the pansy saying “I’m too sick of listening to my crimes! Spare me!”
@ShimonPro The order should be he can’t talk about the case, the judge or anything related to it in general.
RT @BradMossEsq: Want some cheese with that whine? https://t.co/Trw8C25k9I
@kylegriffin1 Lol @ this lying POS.
He had plenty of time to shut his mouth and understand what he did was wrong. He didn’t. Instead he lashed out the media and accused them of misconstruing what he posted. https://t.co/CItD1hoP2O
@girlsreallyrule @NBCNews Oh no doubt there will be criminal charges.
@ZoeTillman A full blown gag order would be just as satisfactory as revoked bail.
@ryanjreilly Exactly. She showed him mercy and took into account his need for media tours and he essentially disregarded the good faith she showed him. He can either have his bail revoked or a tighter gag order.
@selectedwisdom Not believable in the least bit.
Hey Mangolini what happened to the national emergency? https://t.co/UuYhEbjNnH
@ZoeTillman Stronger gag order! Stronger gag order! Stronger gag order!
@ZoeTillman Lol @ them thinking “no change” will fly. He admitted to posting an inflammatory image about judge Jackson. His ass should go to jail or get stronger gag order.
Stone clearly lacks self control.	So here’s an ultimatum:	Stronger gag order or go to jail until the trial. https://t.co/eLJWgKM3nJ
@BradMossEsq Lol lol. Did the deep state wipe his mind and make him forget the name of his assistants?
@ShimonPro “May be”..🙄	Lol this is a disaster.
Happy birthday @repjohnlewis ! https://t.co/AwquPj42Mw
@ryanjreilly Those poor volunteers left out.
@PoliticusSarah I remember that time I posted a cross hair of Trump. Me and friends got drunk and we’re talking shit about Trump. 😃 oh wait that never happened!
@ryanjreilly Him saying he didn’t “Have an idea of who sent it to him.” Is only making his case worse.
@ZoeTillman @integrity4USA If the word “sorry” solved everything then we would all be fine and dandy.
@ZoeTillman @integrity4USA That judge is wiping the floor with Stone and I am loving it.
@kylegriffin1 Scumbag.
@kathrynw5 @ClareHymes22 Trespass is the wrong word.
@BradMossEsq The glorified trickster done ****ed up.
@charles_gaba This is what Celtic cross looks like	It looks nothing like that target symbol Stone posted. https://t.co/cdAQ31klgG
@charles_gaba Really? Like really?!
@BradMossEsq He could always write an apology letter and have his lawyers give it to the judge. He’s already contradicting himself on the stand.
@ryanjreilly She is really, really, really, REALLY pissed.
OMFG...😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/Wi3ewlYCGj
@SpicyFiles @ZoeTillman @BritainEakin It’s like going to an officer to go **** himself and when you’re arrested saying the reason you did it is because you don’t like police.
Lol okay so I know what I was sick with on Sunday. I had a cold and now my mom has it.😅
Here’s my thoughts on Roger Stone’s apology: 🖕	Get bent cuck. https://t.co/buQ7yWzw12
@KatiePhang She’s kicking his ass.
@BritainEakin I’m not buying this apology.
@SpicyFiles @ZoeTillman @BritainEakin ...Really? So just because he’s worried about being raped in jail he decided to attack the judge?
@BradMossEsq That’s an insult to the court and an insult to all Americans that know EXACTLY what that symbol is.
“How hard is it to find an image that doesn’t have crosshairs?” https://t.co/GMnTX62rw3
Another opportunity that he’ll likely squander. https://t.co/htcvoA9ROS

@ryanjreilly Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison! 	Send him to prison!
@jmk_bnr @KenDilanianNBC @JoyceWhiteVance @mitchellreports @jmk_bnr @KenDilanianNBC isn’t a lawyer but @JoyceWhiteVance is. Investigators are going to look at everything Trump has done and take it into account.
@AndrewFeinberg @BetoORourke @AndrewFeinberg I bet you got three cavities.
@ZerlinaMaxwell MAGAts don’t understand black people!
@AynRandPaulRyan @FoxNews Sup snowflakes!  Didn’t want this aired cuz ya didn’t want viewers to see your golden boy taken to task?🤣
@AnushayHossain Finally watched and just wow...😂😂😂😂
Along with the impending Russian asset charges from Mueller there already enough reason to begin impeachment hearings for individual-1. https://t.co/bT4Em5ozGb

@ZerlinaMaxwell 😂😂😂
@AuthorKimberley @LibsInAmerica Stone going to prison would the biggest treat of the day.
The Republicans crying of voter fraud is a parody in itself considering how Mark Harris participated in it. The only reason they claim voting fraud is a bigger deal than hacking is so they can cheat voting laws. https://t.co/Al8rrv6HH9
@NightlyPolitics @joncoopertweets Good. Let the fear consume you.
@TimHannan I forgive repentant former MAGA like @davidmweissman but those that continue to make lies for this horrendous, vile, racist, stochastic terrorist radicalizing, xenophobic,anti-Semitic white supremacist scumbag needs to get bent. He’s a danger to the country.
RT @ZoeTillman: There are now legal challenges to Trump's national emergency declaration pending in three circuits – DC, the 9th, and the 5…

@JoyceWhiteVance If @realDonaldTrump didn’t inspire #MagaBomber and responsible for torrent of attacks on the press his condemnation would be okay. The reality is that Trump is part of the problem.

@rebeccaballhaus Awwwww Senate intel gets first crack?! Boo!
@politicususa Cool he’s committing perjury now too.
@kazweida And here comes the fake outrage from Earth 2/Fox News.
@MiekeEoyang Trump should be impeached if Mueller report shows he’s a Russian agent.
@Vernam @emilyjanefox Eh that works when they’re in the country.
RT @mcspocky: #MakeMeCringeIn4Words Agolf Twitler leads America https://t.co/ZSXt8lYHN7
@1IronMan2020 Seriously,he stole this election. It needs to be nullified and either @McCreadyForNC declared winner or a whole new election called.
@kazweida Me either. In the same week that Smollet is indicted for filing a false police report a loony Coast guard officer is arrested for plotting to commit a domestic terrorist attack.
