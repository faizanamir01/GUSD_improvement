Our public school system is, in many places, irreparably broken.
@BerkmanAlex @IkeWeLike @WillisJermane @CovCathColonels @JD_Tuccille We're just going to have to agree to disagree.  I understand why your honing in on, and trying to make the discussion about CHARTER schools, but from the beginning of this discussion I've been advocating for school CHOICE.

@BerkmanAlex @IkeWeLike @WillisJermane @CovCathColonels @JD_Tuccille This article doesn't support, or even address, a single assertion you've made...  it focuses on so called 'discrimination' by private schools, which I'm not opposed to.

My question, exactly https://t.co/VnatwyFaku
This is interesting... https://t.co/I7nf7rzueb
@OurRepublic12 @Elizabethbryso5 @FrankLuntz Again, I pretty much agree.  But... does it mean something that most believed Trump vs HRC?  The bottom line is the DNC could have ran my daily Subway sandwich guy in '16 and beat Trump.  They were 1st &amp; 2nd, the two most unlikable candidates in the history of the US.
@OurRepublic12 @Elizabethbryso5 @FrankLuntz Agreed it's not lies.  Agreed it was conning.  But I (think) we can both agree the conning is to the level we would expect from any political candidate?  Don't make me do it but I can spend an hour or two finding PLENTY of dems saying crazy shit (and you know it).
@OurRepublic12 @Elizabethbryso5 @FrankLuntz Uhmm, let step back a re-read this string. To refute your freewheeling claim, I posted a source, from the most conservative of conservative publications, stating that Trump is the most conservative president the US has ever had.  You replied with...  hyperbole?

@luanne_j I agree!  And follow both side for the same reason.  Being able to curate our own news cycle is definitely not helping our society.
@luanne_j I believe it... we have the opposite problem here in Washington State... either way it is a problem.  		That said, NYT really does bill itself as "non-partisan", which events like #CurtainGate reveal to be nonsense.  That's all I was pushing back on here.
@luanne_j (or in this case, the left doing it... even though the headline led one to believe that the right was doing it)

@JonahNRO I'm thinking that the "senior official" isn't quite as senior as he/she wants to think they are.  And the NYT is happy to oblige them.  There was nothing to be gained by it's publication (other than to potentially boost the career / publicity of a low-level player in the admin?)
