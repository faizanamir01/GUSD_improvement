@_ZacharyMiller @benshapiro Thankfully Harry is dropping further and further down the line to the throne, so he and Megan will become increasingly irrelevant (especially when they inevitably get divorced). William and Kate seem to be very traditional, which is good if you care about the monarchy.

@Radguy1 @Rossputin @AOC So you’re arguing for an entire overhaul of the United States healthcare system because of your own anecdotal experience. Seems...naive
@Radguy1 @Rossputin @AOC The problem here is that you’re guilty of relying on extreme solutions. You make assumptions about others’ views on health care, and for you the only possible solution to problems in our health care system is a complete systematical overhaul.
@Rossputin @Radguy1 @AOC Or that a private system that exists is comparable (along metrics such as costs and mortality rate) to a phantom public system that doesn’t exist?
@Rossputin @AOC For the radical Left, they’ve shown time and time again that they see no difference between money in your pocket and money in theirs. Bernie’s continual rhetoric about “healthcare costs” proves that

@redsteeze @SuperAndrea Just another attempt to make wealth “inequality” a matter of immorality. @AOC’s assumption of moral leadership is staggering
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon See my later message. I agree that this policy isn’t good, but instead of making it another argument against the apparent immorality of wealth inequality (which is exactly the point she is trying to make), just don’t allow people to hold spots.
@kzap333 @CLK55 @AOC @Wimbledon You’re claiming that this isn’t an argument of morality, and yet the language used throughout this thread regarding fairness and money is inherently a moral argument. Again we’re not going to agree.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon However, I don’t think it’s immoral as people can queue, entrance to the event is free, and people are voluntarily holding a single place in line in return for payment. If people are basing immorality on the money element, then just demand that people cannot hold spaces.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon It’s pretty clear we’re not going to agree. I just think we need to have a more specific definition of immorality, and not just believe that everything we might not like as inherently immoral. I’m not a fan of that practice either, and have never claimed to be an advocate.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon I’ve never stepped off topic. My issue throughout is the assumption of immorality based on something being viewed as bad behavior. The difference is that seats are presumably free, so it’s first come first serve. If people want to go, they can queue. Tickets require a fee.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon 3) now, if homeless people can make money holding a single place; why is this bad IF there is nothing stopping anyone else from also waiting in line? This is an absurd accusation of immorality.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon 2) loving the use of Wimbledon as an example by the way. Certainly an excellent example of fair, accessible and affordable sporting events...
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon 1) You’re synonymizing holding someone’s place in line with allowing them to join with the person waiting. If there’s nothing physically stopping people from queuing, and the person swaps out so no places behind them are replaced, it’s not the same as cutting in line.

@BillyM_92 @morganisawizard @NotEricWagner Pro-life is anti-abortion, so those views can easily be mutually exclusive from vaccines. It’s just a weak attempt to merge two ideologies as a quick argument.

@VickiMcKenna @LearnedToCode @jczarling Willingness to raise an unwanted child has nothing to do with being pro- or anti-abortion. This is an illogical argument to use as a deflection instead of debating the true issue, which is when life begins.
@Rabbi224 @IlhanMN Both. Always both.
@LahavHarkov It’s just playing the intersectional game on level 10. It’s disgusting that candidates who ran in part on the fact they provided diversity to Congress are using that diversity as a shield against legitimate criticism of bigotry.

@RubinReport Not even subtle anymore.
@Rossputin @IlhanMN This is just a slightly more wordy “sorry not sorry”.
@NuanceBro @RubinReport In all honesty, I’d have to look into Ron Paul more deeply as I have quite patchy knowledge of his history, and don’t feel comfortable to jump to yes/no on anti-semitism. Is he an example, for you, of misassigned antisemitism by @RubinReport?
@NuanceBro @RubinReport 2) at worst, yes from my limited knowledge of him, his words and actions could definitely be defined as anti-Semitic in the same way that many on the Left are.
@NuanceBro @RubinReport 1) In the context of the cartoon, if it was his staffer who tweeted it, one must assume they’ve been fired. If it was him, it was either anti-Semitic (as well as racist) or stupid, or both. On a general level, he’s at best heavily involved with anti-semites.
@NuanceBro @RubinReport Regarding that cartoon he posted and deleted?
@morganisawizard @NotEricWagner We need more clarification regarding what “mandatory” means. Is it “must be vaccinated to attend public school”? Or is it “will be forced to vaccinate”? This is crucial context. Regardless, I fail to see how this is in any way related to being or not being pro-life...

@Ostrov_A @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @IlhanMN I’m gonna guess no.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom So you’re not answering my answer to your concern. Endless deflection from the issue of whether BDS applies a double standard and whether the one-state solution is bigoted. You’re not worth my time.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Then I hope they’ll be advocating for the same from Egypt and Jordan, if they’re not focused on a double standard for Jews? It’s clear you’re not listening to what I’m saying, and just focussed on deflecting from my concern of consistency of criticism. Not worth my time.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom You’re not reading what I’m saying. I agree with you that not all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. But if the only criticism is of the one Jewish state, and worse countries are never mentioned, that’s concerning no?
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I didn’t say support Palestine over Israel. I said openly support BDS and one-state solution. A one-state solution, implemented by a state that cries “from the river to the sea”, and by Hamas’ charter which calls for the murder of Jews, won’t cause death?
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Interesting that there is no such boycott or protest against Egypt or Jordan for persecution. Just a thought.
@Ataur005 @Ehmashoes @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom If you noticed, I stated that BDS is bigoted. You’re not defending that, just trying to deflect by forcing me to argue that Zionism isn’t bigoted. Not going to waste my time on an argument I wasn’t even posing because you can’t defend BDS.
@CJEriksen @ewarren I don’t think there’s a huge difference. Individual policies often go hand-in-hand with popular sentiments if they’re of certain topics. For example, welfare state + taxes + class warfare against the wealthy.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I don’t know what your personal views are on the matter, but for characters like Omar and Tlaib to openly and consistently criticize Israel while advocating for BDS (which is based on bigoted lies) and the one-state solution (which would result in genocide) is not reasonable.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I’m sure you’re honest enough to see that. But before I waste time on this, are you going to reject any borderline-AS things Ilhan Omar has done, or just flower behind the “Israel isn’t Judaism” argument? Because if it’s the latter, no “evidence” will change your mind anyway.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Maybe because the boycott is based on bigotry alone?
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I agree that Israel doesn’t ALWAYS equal Judaism. But at the same time, anti-Israel or anti-Zionism is not mutually exclusive from anti-semitism. If applied inconsistently, for example, against Israel and no other countries, then it’s targeting the one Jewish state.
@ewarren Celebrating populism...awesome...
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom And if this one tweet was made, I’d be less inclined to jump to “anti-semitism”. But it’s not the first, and it won’t be the last.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Which would be fine if #IlhamOmar consistently made the same comments regarding other PACs. But she doesn’t. She’s consistently targeting Israel.
To be fair, I can’t help but giggle every time say “Hezbollah”...what’s hilarious is she opens by talking about sound bites out of context...and then laughs about Hezbollah... https://t.co/3ZBb7BdAcv
@Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Yes I realize that. It’s a joke how a comment that could have been about Israel was actually just another standard anti-Semitic trope about Jewish conspiracies and money-based power
@TheRealDSuggs Despicable.
@Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN It’s all about those Benjamins. She was talking about Netanyahu, right? Right? No? Oh...
@sjs856 @breakfastclubam @HowardU Thanks for talking about it though, I found it interesting even if we don’t agree.
@sjs856 @breakfastclubam @HowardU However, for me, I find it hard to take her seriously as the “progressive” icon she’s claiming to be when her history is mixed at best along these lines. The primaries will be interesting when she’s tested on those lines for sure.
@sjs856 @breakfastclubam @HowardU 1) Does appealing the ruling re: the death penalty fall under that? There are multiple issues with her past as DA/AG that are far from progressive, but I understand if you base that on things you care about.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 3) but it’s also clear that the ability to check for contagious diseases should be part of any immigration control system, and so the influx of any illegal immigrants carries the obvious risk of preventable diseases that are prevelant elsewhere. This also holds for travel.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 2) and regarding immigration, I think it’s both difficult data to get hold of, and also not the entire problem by a long shot. I think we should be careful to focus on the issue of reduced vaccination rates, rather than just laying the blame squarely at the feet of immigration.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 1) I’d like to look into how many parents abstain from vaccination and don’t send their children to public school for related or unrelated reasons.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 2) ...to then argue about conservatism. If it was to stop children from attending public school, I have zero problem with this. If people are thrown in jail, then I agree more with your reasoning. So I guess we need more specificity regarding the bill and enforcement/outcomes.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 1) I think it’s an interesting argument, but one that is trying to use basic conservatism as a loop hole as opposed to logical reasoning. The bill’s goal was to disallow non-vaccination for “philosophical” reasons. I’d like to see more info regarding the outcome of this...
@KayFellowz I wrote an article about precisely this for the @FDRLST. You can choose not to vaccinate, but you should isolate yourself from those you would put in harms way. Every choice has consequences. https://t.co/pkZSDB8cHU
@KayFellowz @ChuckEChaves If you choose not to vaccinate, then you should isolate yourself from society. It is not your right to choose not to protect yourself and others and then willingly put yourself and others at risk without their consent. You can have either, but not both.
Omg no way. #shutdown2.0  https://t.co/uBqHwbuBA0
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU So that’s not really answering my question, it’s just providing a promise of legitimacy which means nothing to someone who has a difference of opinion. Not sure we’re going to get anywhere here, but I appreciate the conversation.
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU And so it becomes an issue of how many “non-progressive” things are needed to no longer be non-progressive? Seems highly subjective. If someone does one anti-Semitic thing, for example, and lots of non anti-Semitic things, are they anti-Semitic? How about two/three/four?
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU And again, Back on Track isn’t fully positive (i.e. had some significant criticisms regarding illegal immigration) while being objectively positive in general. But there are instances of her career that are thoroughly non-progressive
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU What are your thoughts on the number of people who are disagreeing that she is the progressive she suddenly claims to be? Such as the argument posed here: https://t.co/1Q4d9l5I2Z not looking for a “gotcha”, but I am genuinely tired of politicians reinventing themselves as needed
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU While it’s almost certain she did a lot of good if she was a prosecutor, there is a lot of evidence that she’s not the progressive prosecutor she is now claiming to have been.
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU Then I guess all of the conflicting “information” isn’t free?

@Hillarymark @duncanrobinson @Rossputin @chrisgreybrexit Because there is no agreement amongst the “People’s Vote” community for this, and many who advocate for a “People’s Vote” are doing so in order to achieve Remain. If the vote was based on previous decisions, I.e. withdrawal agreement or no deal, then it would be more agreeable.

@duncanrobinson @Hillarymark @Rossputin @chrisgreybrexit Then the “People’s Vote” is a false choice - Withdrawal Agreement or Remain.
@Hillarymark @Rossputin @duncanrobinson @chrisgreybrexit So you’re basing that on one man who was hell-bent on leaving Europe, not the result of the first “People’s Vote”? The concept of “checking” is absurd, regardless of whether the result is what you’d personally want or not.
@Rossputin @duncanrobinson @chrisgreybrexit Would we be checking had the vote been for Remain? I doubt it. The People’s Vote is simply a way to manipulate the electorate to achieve the desired result.

@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel So, overall 1) cut out emotion, 2) focus on the key argument, 3) use their set of core beliefs about the value of a human
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel The key part is to play by the logical rules of the person you want to influence, and not by your set of assumptions. It’s like trying to convince an atheist that god exists by citing the Bible, when they don’t believe that the Bible is of any historical value
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel So then I focus on the key point of disagreement, which is whether unborn life is life, and whether that life is morally human. Since we can all agree that killing a human life is wrong, that leaves us with the single task of deciding when life begins
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel The main tactic I use (which has been successful in at least starting a dialogue) is approaching it with no emotional arguments. Abortion is so naturally emotional that it often means that logical arguments are lost very quickly

@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel If we got rid of all of the emotional arguments that distract from this core point, I think the pro-life movement would be more successful
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel Except you’d then have to make the argument that the parasite is of same moral value as a human, which comes down the the same core argument that we get to every time. Is an unborn baby/fetus/embryo a human.
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel Like yours if someone calls a baby a parasite, for example
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel The issue with the abortion debate is it’s trying to STOP something, and so the debate will always change and reasons to keep it will evolve, so it’s the responsibility of the pro-life movement to approach each new reason with logical and objective arguments
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel You started by saying that those who deny that abortion is murder are like flat-earthers. That’s unlikely to open a dialogue with anyone who may change their mind, even if it’s one person, and that one person decides against having an abortion, if it is murder, isn’t it worth it?
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel Ok, then what’s the gameplan? Yes, many can’t defend their position, because it’s often based on flawed logic. Yes, many refuse to hear other opinions. But some may be willing, and so if abortion is worth fighting against, then it’s worth using persuasive tactics.
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel It’s certainly a good response to the “it’s a parasite” logic!

@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel You might be right, but the issue is that calling someone ignorant is usually an unsuccessful way of getting them to change their mind...
@Sara_Rose_G Is neither an option?
@ZeldaAGabriel I would much rather focus on the core principle of when life begins rather than calling abortion a Holocaust, for instance, since (as a general society) we already believe murder is wrong, and so the key step is believing that unborn life is life
@ZeldaAGabriel I think we both agree in that case. I’m fine with using both, but just talking about the dehumanizing aspect is divisive, and regardless of whether it’s true, is more likely to deter people who might otherwise change their minds about abortion
@ZeldaAGabriel Again, this is ignoring my entire point. If I agree with you, then it’s a waste of time because we both agree. If I disagree with you, then you’re doing nothing to change my mind except for purely emotional arguments based on the belief that others may not hold
@ZeldaAGabriel But if they are or aren’t, these statements are meaningless through the eyes of someone who disagrees - which is my point. If someone doesn’t think unborn life is life, the objective is to persuade them that it is life, not just call abortion murder or slavery.
@ZeldaAGabriel And so while your comment regarding the comparison is understandable, it won’t change anyone’s mind who disagrees with you.
@ZeldaAGabriel Not at all. I made the point that instead of two sides shouting “it’s murder” or “it’s a choice”, those who are pro-life need to focus on why unborn life constitutes life. That should be the repeated focus as it’s the point of core disagreement.
@ZeldaAGabriel Read what I’ve said without your quick assumption that I’m simply a pro-choicer, and see it from a different perspective
@ZeldaAGabriel You’re really not reading what I’m writing, and assuming that I’m pro-choice. My point is that you need to engage with those who disagree by focusing on why their core assumptions are wrong, instead of saying “you’re wrong”, IF you want change
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn’t agree with the comparison.
@steve_stout_ @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn’t agree with the comparison.
@steve_stout_ @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel I think there are reasons regarding personal responsibility, and then whether or not it should be funded with public money
@JasonHa63444912 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn’t agree with the comparison.
@ZeldaAGabriel @LiveAction My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn’t agree with the comparison.
@LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel This is only true if one’s reason for “hating” abortion is the belief that abortion is murder. In that case, this argument holds. If not, then it’s not equivalent to the other examples, because they’re all based on the premise of life. We must be specific and honest.

@YDlavine78 @bikesalsa @bariweiss Conversely, I also think it’s wrong to label all critics of Israel as “anti-Zionist” or “anti-Israel”. Specificity of language on both sides would help.
@KayaJones Details
@SadMusketeer @hegelwaswrong @bikesalsa @bariweiss There are several Israeli policies which I disagree with, with varying levels of concern, but to blindly label them as an apartheid state and the sole cause for the suffering of the Palestinian people is a violent lie.
@SadMusketeer @hegelwaswrong @bikesalsa @bariweiss And that’s assuming (falsely) that Israel is even comparable to Hamas or Hezbollah. General ignorance of the entire Israel/Palestine conflict is hugely beneficial when driving anti-Israel rhetoric, which often has deep ties with anti-Semitic ideology.
@SadMusketeer @hegelwaswrong @bikesalsa @bariweiss When it comes to Israel, my first step in deciding whether it’s anti-semitic or not is to question consistency.

@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Which I do reject on the basis of being Jewish. While you’re right that there are a small number of far-right Israeli political groups, they are also based on ethno-nationalism, and the vast majority of European far-right parties are deeply AS
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G And then for some reason that got categorized as Nazi/far-right apologists
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G I apologize, I misread your last sentence. My point regarding the Nazis was that, while they have some far-right traits when it comes to ethno-nationalism, they also have far-left traits such as state-level control of industry and means of production. So it’s not a simple as L/R
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G And that’s not what I’ve tried to so, so your comment is irrelevant.
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Again, you’re just accusing me of being far-right with ZERO evidence. 👋
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Indeed, Hitler himself denied that the Nazis were Left or Right. They don’t fit into this convenient spectrum which allow people to bash anyone with vaguely conservative viewpoints
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Side-note/advice. If you want to argue that the Nazis are far-right, that’s fine. But doing so by recharacterizing my statement as an attempt to do something immoral in order to avoid having to provide any evidence of your own is just lazy.

@Sara_Rose_G Israel is a gift to anti-semites in as much as it gives a platform for AS which can be justified as criticism of a country, not a people. Pour all AS into anti-Israel and voila.
@Sara_Rose_G Especially when “contemporary” AS is now thinly-veiled as “anti-Zionist”, made complicated by the fact that criticism of Israel may or may not be AS
@Sara_Rose_G A big issue is the belief in anti-Conservative rhetoric which implies that AS has always come from the right. Partnered with the fact that most people don’t know about AS beyond the Holocaust, and think that the Nazis were far-right, it seems unthinkable that AS exists elsewhere

@clc3099 @Slate Two things can be true at once...it can be bad when said by both sides. Don’t assume my view in order to justify your own.
For the record. “Palestine from the river to the sea” is #antisemitic. It was coined by the #PLO, a terrorist organization, and is still used by #Hamas, a terrorist organization. Both call for the expulsion of extermination of #Jews. THAT IS ANTISEMITIC. #antisemitism #israel
@childofeternity @Slate The account that has a BDS image as it’s background always provides a true objective definition of what is anti-semitic.
@Slate Calling for the destruction of Israel, and therefore the expulsion or extermination of Jews, is obvious anti-semitism. You can criticize Israel without being anti-semitic, but don’t hide anti-semitism behind your ridiculous logic.

@BernieSanders Are some rich people greedy, yes. But some are not, and it’s wrong to label an entire portion of society as inherently evil due to their wealth.
@BernieSanders Are you seriously all arguing that NO gains have ever been as a result of charity by the rich and powerful? Chan Zuckerberg gave $25mil to combat Ebola, The Gates Foundation gives billions in support of social initiatives, and George Soros gave huge funds to fight apartheid.
@BernieSanders That’s completely false. Plenty of gains in the world have been fueled by the rich and powerful. Your rhetoric is based on politics of envy.

@CatrinNye @eddiemarsan @nazirafzal @VictoriaLIVE Unfortunately, it’s clear that the victims of these awful crimes are just pawns for political gain. If Tommy Robinson truly cared, he wouldn’t be jeopardizing existing trials
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy Not worth any more of my time. Please try and question the unshakeable support of Tommy Robinson. It’s obviously a good thing to try and combat these awful crimes, but that doesn’t justify blind support of someone of his character, history, or temperament.
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy Two things can be true at once, and that’s the point you don’t understand. I can want these atrocities to end, as I hope the majority of people do, AND think Tommy is not the man to lead this fight. You only understand binary arguments it seems
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy Do you perhaps think that I’m trying to make a difference by pointing out that Tommy is not the hero he’s held up to be, and not a conservative thought leader? Or are the only acceptable actions mimicking Tommy by screaming bigoted rhetoric in the street or breaking the law?
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy 😂 you’re hilariously illogical. The police are the ones who handle this, and they clearly are given that he was outside an ongoing trial. I, on the other hand, am NOT on trial, and you won’t bully me or deflect from the original comments made.
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy This is such lazy logic. Don’t criticize Tommy, otherwise you want children to be raped. SO lazy, so immoral.
@jme2020 Nice attempt at deflection. Try and force me to agree with you, otherwise you accuse me of supporting child rape. That’s such lazy logic, and it won’t work. It’s just the kind of disgusting generalizations that can be expected from those who think what he’s doing is ethical.
@jme2020 Spurious? He went to jail for all of these things...
@Johnwadey @BBCNews Fair treatment for everyone means rights to a fair trial, too. If he wants to expose, then focus on exposing the unexposed, not jumping onto an existing court case and trying to get thrown in jail to act as a martyr.
@ganais_anais They’re ignoring it SO much that the alleged rapists were exposed OUTSIDE THEIR TRIAL. You can’t expose someone who is already charged and in court.
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy He wants to use obviously emotional and dreadful crimes to further his own narrative and political ambitions. He’s not exposing people if they’re already charged and facing trial. He’s just jeopardizing the trials, and therefore the chance of justice for actual victims.

@AndrewLawton Knowing #TommyRobinson and his history, he probably has a prison bag by the door every day.
@H2O_Nick Was he arrested for reporting on gangs that weren’t being charged? Did he spark those investigations and charges? OR did he jump on these cases as they’re divisive and emotive, and fit well with his narrative? He’s had no impact.

@CassandraRules For a man who hates being in prison so much, he’s really bad at obeying the law. He’s not a hero. He willingly risked justice for the victims of the gang rape trials in pursuit of furthering his own brand.
With #TommyRobinson facing his retrial today, remember that he risked justice for true victims while furthering his own selfish aims. His attempt to become a hooligan-turned-martyr must be rejected. #oldbailey
@DVATW How do you expose gangs who have already been charged with the crimes? He’s not punished for reporting on uncharged gangs. His list of errors is quite significant.
@DVATW 1) what political bucket would he fall into, if not the far right? 2) it’s amazing how we are talking about justice for Tommy when he willingly risked the justice of the ACTUAL victims. He defied court orders, he’s not blameless and therefore justice involves consequences.

@conservmillen @TheRealDSuggs It’s like American cable tv. Sex and violence is fine, bad language is not.
@Olly4Northfield @K_Niemietz I also don’t see what your question has to do with my comment. You’re deflecting from the comment by trying to label me as someone who supports sexual assault.

@Olly4Northfield @K_Niemietz It’s a matter of idealism versus realism. Idealistically, everyone should be safe regardless what steps they take or don’t take. However, that’s not the reality of the world we live in, where you cannot account for the immorality of others.
@Olly4Northfield @K_Niemietz While it’s certainly awful that this is even something we have to discuss, I don’t think it’s right to mock the police advising people how to stay safe. The truth is that there are bad people in the world, and we are also responsible for our own safety.
@andrealeadsom I hope that this is a good first step down the road of encouraging us to acknowledge mental health, address the impact it has on so many, and remove the stigma that surrounds it.
@katiet121 No joke. It’s the simple next step in an attempt to label anyone who isn’t vocally Democrat as anti-women advocates for rape.

@KassyDillon I’m learning so much this week. APPARENTLY Ben Shapiro is a white supremicist? Exciting news for diversity, the KKK are now accepting Jews! It’s a victory for us.
@ElishaKrauss @benshapiro The #resist stuff is so ridiculous if you aren’t even stepping outside your own bubble. Endlessly preaching to the choir just makes them feel like their view is the only view.
@ElishaKrauss @benshapiro “Haha Republicans suck!” is an acceptable type of discrimination it seems. Also...what’s the point in door-knocking on people who are already voting Dem??
@korlando2251 @BridgetPhetasy Agree. I think that while some of what some Dems have been doing (accusations of sexual assault with no evidence) can be defined as evil, it’s wrong to label the entire ideology as evil or satanic. It’s also unproductive if we want to repair division.
@TomiLahren The value of protest is linked directly with the reality of what is being protested.
@DVATW I disagree wholeheartedly. The #MeToo movement has been abused and hijacked, but to label the movement like this is appalling.
@BridgetPhetasy Absolutely. I’m certainly not one to assume the moral high ground for any politicians! But I think it’s been very much the Dem talking point of recent times to beat all opposing arguments down with accusations of immorality, rather than addressing points of disagreement
@BridgetPhetasy I think the key issue is that many Democrats claim complete ownership of morality, meaning that anyone who disagrees with them is inherently immoral as a result
@BridgetPhetasy The self-censoring is another weapon of the more radical Left. Bully those into ultimately being afraid of voicing reasonable, rational opinions.

@lyndseyfifield The details really don’t matter apart from “person assaults another person”. His excuse for being an advocate for pro-choice does a disservice to the law-abiding people who hold pro-choice views, and implies that violence against pro-life viewpoints is in any way justified.

@OkeyMor57 @Slate If this only applied to homosexual couples, it would clearly be discriminatory. However, it doesn’t, and so the headline is very misleading. The basic rule is now “no visas for non-married partner if you are able to be legally married in your country of origin”
@OkeyMor57 @Slate I’m saying that this article is implying it’s discrimination based on sexual orientation, which it is not. If you are from a country that allows gay marriage, you must be married to get a visa. For homo-/hetero-sexual couples alike, they can only get visas if married (if legal)
@Slate This is false. They’re denying all non-married partners for heterosexual and homosexual couples. If you are married; you can get a visa. If you are from a country which does not allow gay marriage; you can get a visa.
@kayleighmcenany @SenBooker Got to admire his honesty that it doesn’t matter to the Dems whether he’s innocent or not...in a way...hmm maybe not.

@KellyAngard @LouiseMensch @DarcieChan @thespybrief @realDonaldTrump I do think there’s a legitimate problem in partisan politics where you condemn/condone based on personal bias, so this is a fair comment.

@Daniel_Sugarman @SkyNews Agree. Giving someone who is nothing more than a race-hate stirrer any kind of platform is only helping legitimize him as a so-called “Conservative” voice, when he’s just a racist criminal.

@Strontiumdog500 @jeremycorbyn I don’t...but last time I checked it’s possible to both a) not like killing Arab children, and b) think Hamas are evil for wanting to kill Israeli children. But standard tactic, call me a murderer because I dare to question dear old Corbin. 👋
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @POTUS https://t.co/0DzECxlZiN
@deniseisabroad You assume I disagree with you! The problem is, is that this is a chicken or the egg question of not playing by the rules, and the first to play by the rules again will be destroyed politically
@jeremycorbyn How much did your Hamas holidays cost? Asking for a friend.
@CNNPolitics I don’t think they are raising doubts about her story, but it’s perfectly legitimate to question motives for delaying the process.
@AsheSchow These are also very conservative man-spreads. Barely 30 degrees. I think we should be limiting serious complaints to 160 degrees and greater.
@Paintmeblue33 @AsheSchow That’s what people should be focused on. The lack of evidence. Not silly things like mystery envelopes
@Paintmeblue33 @AsheSchow Is what I’m saying
@Paintmeblue33 @AsheSchow There is no evidence
@Paintmeblue33 @AsheSchow I think we are on the same page. Let me reword it: what matters is that there is not enough evidence supporting the truth of the accusations
@Paintmeblue33 @AsheSchow What I said is correct. You’re reading it as if I said “...the lack of evidence, which proves the accusations are true”. Gosh I love punctuation 😂
@trussliz Solid Rocky Horror pun.
@IIIpercent1776 @AsheSchow What do you mean? There isn’t sufficient evidence of the accusations being true...
@AsheSchow What’s frustrating is people’s willingness to get distracted by everything that doesn’t matter, rather than focusing on what does matter - the lack of evidence which proves the accusations are true. That. Is. It. I don’t care about envelopes.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC It’s important that conservatives stand by what is right. https://t.co/0DzECxlZiN
@AsheSchow Smear! Slander! She was a bully! And vanished! In all seriousness, yes. They were respectful and objective questions.

@benshapiro The Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool is starting to really pile up with people the Republicans have killed off during this process
@TheAtlantic @russellberman You’re not on trial. Yes, because she’s not the accused. It’s not a trial SO the Dems can breeze past that pesky old “innocent until proven guilty” roadblock.
@gal_feisty @SenGillibrand I agree, an investigation is reasonable. But the dems could have asked for an investigation when the accusations were made. Delaying it seems like justice isn’t their primary concern, no?
@katiet121 Hopefully more people will feel this way, regardless of how they personally feel about the Kavanaugh/Ford issue.
@anneapplebaum I’d question that millions of ordinary people are globalists. I think the majority of world leaders either are globalists or pretend to be globalists because, you know, caring about other people etc.
@1776Stonewall “The Senate Judiciary Committee needs to slow down and postpone its vote until after the Midterms. Then who cares”
@gal_feisty @SenGillibrand 1) you can be reasonably frustrated by Garland being blocked from the SC. 2) Garland’s life wasn’t destroyed by accusations with no evidence. To claim they’re the same, or to excuse one with the other, is intellectually dishonest. I could have just responded “Clarence Thomas”
@Slate This is not about whether these KINDS of things happen. It’s about whether Kavanaugh did these kinds of things. Specificity is crucial, we are dealing with individuals.
@morganisawizard I guess that’s a compliment? I guess she’s distracted you for 3 hours from warmongering?
@morganisawizard Given the stuff that’s been said today, this is friendly banter!
@USANEWS007 @SenFeinstein I didn’t know she drove herself to work!
@larryelder She thinks &lt;insert whatever opinion is now popular&gt;, obviously.
@EyeOnPolitics @johnhawkinsrwn This is fantastic. Terrible that it was necessary, but fantastic to see. The destruction of people’s lives for political gain based on no evidence should never be permitted, whether Republican or Democrat.
@bennyjohnson Oh Jim. He thinks he’s so deeply insightful, while he continually misses the obvious.
@MMFlint And if he wasn’t emotional, you’d be accusing him of being sociopathically calm. Analyze the evidence
@SenGillibrand What are you talking about? If you wanted truth, you would have called for an investigation when the accusations were first made. Want the truth? Press charges. This is about stalling until the mid-terms, and you’re willing to destroy a possibly-innocent man for it.
@jimmy_wales Because allowing a man who hasn’t been proven guilty by any corroborated evidence to be left out to dry is morally wrong.
@ElishaKrauss Cory Booker is the character you hated in season 1 who just WON’T leave
@DevinSenaUI It’s beyond me how you can make such broad statements about vast parts of the population who agree with specific parts of what you advocate for, but whom you alienate with your overly inflammatory language and sweeping generalizations.
@KamalaHarris Calling on the accused to call for themselves to be investigated is absurd, and you know it. If you want the investigation, press charges. Otherwise, stop grandstanding for 2020.
If we sit and permit someone to be bullied into asking for an investigation into themselves, something no-one is required to do, we’ve lost something significant.
@ElishaKrauss @LindseyGrahamSC @nikkihaley With @benshapiro as Press Secretary, just for kicks.
Accidentally played @benshapiro podcast on 2x speed. It’s like listening to a chipmunk. Not making that mistake again! #benshapiro
Good for you #LindseyGraham. Good for you.
@CoryBooker So file charges.
@MMFlint According to the photo, the best way to see Fahrenheit 11/9 seems to be to stare at your phone during the entire movie.
@nevancik1 @Slate And what does this have to do with my criticism of the headline claiming that Kavanaugh is presenting himself as a choir boy?
@Slate This is fundamentally false reporting. He denied having sex while at High School, but did admit to drinking, but not to excess and that he could remember his actions. These headlines are blasted out so you can then label him as a liar. Despicable.
@Slate But it’s not, is it.
@KassyDillon @nikkihaley #2024

@xan_desanctis Just...wow.
@Slate Who needs the FBI when you have “journalists” like Seth Meyers on the case!
@QudsNen @StandWithUs @Twitter @jack Define “forever”
@USANEWS007 Even if he is proven innocent, it won’t matter, because then the Democrats will move to claiming that it’s true of a broader narrative that goes beyond Kavanaugh individually.
@nikkihaley You’re doing a great job @nikkihaley! 2024 can’t come soon enough.
@JackPosobiec Just insane. Unfortunately, this mirrors an exciting TV show, and so people won’t remember this as a ridiculous abuse of due process and basic lawful rights. Instead it’ll be another reality show that is soon forgotten, along with the lessons that could have been learned.
@KassyDillon This reminds me of FIFA claiming that soccer fans don’t want goal line technology, because it’s more exciting to watch goals be allowed/disallowed regardless of truth. That, but not soccer. Something that actually matters.
@ElishaKrauss But that would be after mid-terms, @ElishaKrauss!!!!!!!...!!!
@BridgetPhetasy @Ricochet When I have more than a few hundred Twitter followers, I hope I can share my story of being a British person but not actually liking tea all that much. It’s a daily struggle.
@BridgetPhetasy @Ricochet Awesome! What will the topics be?
@donnabrazile @jdforward Jewish relatives? Oh no!! That's relevant.
@LouiseMensch "Kavanaugh's (and the SC's) every decision &amp; good name will be forever tainted". This is the Dem's political back-up plan. If he's proven guilty, then he is (quite rightly) disqualified. If not because of lack of evidence, they can demean every decision he makes.
@RealMarkKennedy Please, that was SO last news cycle.
#Haircut pro-tip: When asked "How long would you like your sideburns?", do not reply "Please could you trim them where they start getting thin?". This is an arrogant assumption of hair symmetry that can backfire.
@DailyCaller None of this is relevant. What is relevant is the complete lack of evidence or witnesses supporting her accusations. That’s it.
@KTHopkins @DonnaChivingto2 For a husband to a caring wife and three kids, who you claim miss him so much, he doesn’t seem to mind repeatedly breaking the law and spending time away from them in jail.
@dbongino Well said! https://t.co/0DzECxlZiN
@Ocasio2018 Defending the indefensible. Who hasn’t been proven guilty in any way. But yeah, get people to text. Good job.
@Kathleen_in_NE @IngrahamAngle None of this matters. What matters is that there is no evidence, no witnesses. So people shouldn’t be focusing on anything else that only dilutes the fact that her claims are, currently, completely uncorroborated.
@johnhawkinsrwn @ellencarmichael Yes. Exactly.
@ellencarmichael @johnhawkinsrwn These kind of reports, which are aimed at discrediting the accuser, are irrelevant. What is relevant is the evidence, or lack thereof. That’s enough. That should be the focus.
@IngrahamAngle “Lawyer” autocorrects to “Lower than low”. Interesting.

@AsheSchow Extreme anonymity. Huh.
@SenGillibrand @realDonaldTrump And what you’ve made clear is that you do believe women, as long as they follow a political narrative you approve of and have no supporting evidence that can be used to prove the accusations.
@TwitchyTeam But we all know he won’t. He’s a grandstanding sleaze whose self-interest is all that matters. He’s a perfect politician!

@SenGillibrand God forbid you try and gather actual supporting evidence so charges can be filed against Kavanaugh, or is it job-done for you if his nomination is dropped?
Yes, these new accusations are horrible. Yes, if true and specified, they should disqualify #Kavanaugh. However, witnesses are needed to corroborate the stories, and that’s what should be focused on. Evidence
@autumnhklein This is the WEIRDEST headline ever. “Accuser with Jewish Relatives” either aims to support validity because...Jews...or don’t support the validity because...Jews....?!?!
@KamalaHarris You’re right that enough is enough. Enough “guilty before proven innocent” and enough “prove you’re innocent” and enough “let’s investigate despite no evidence and no witnesses”. This is disgusting.
RT @redwhitebluex2: @robbysoave And this is why they shouldn’t withdraw. You are effectively calling for Kavanaugh’s life to be ruined base…
@TC_in_TDot @BridgetPhetasy You’re simply not acknowledging that evidence is needed to justify an investigations. Accusations are not enough if there is no evidence. And unfortunately, it being all about winning regardless of truth is just as much of a problem with the Dems, so let’s not pretend otherwise.
@TC_in_TDot @BridgetPhetasy But you have to have evidence to JUSTIFY an investigation. That’s what is being willingly ignored
@robbysoave And this is why they shouldn’t withdraw. You are effectively calling for Kavanaugh’s life to be ruined based on zero evidence because it is easier politically. That’s giving in to blackmail, and will just signal to the Dems that it works. This. is. Wrong.
@BridgetPhetasy You missed “even if it wasn’t you specifically, it’s true for some people, so even if you’re innocent, it’s true of a broader narrative” 🤮
@robsmithonline Peoples complete ignorance of the historic significance of words is....concerning....
@irritatedwoman He’s talking as it if the “past” was millennia ago. The past he’s talking about are within most peoples’ lifetimes. This is disgusting
@prageru Lack of knowledge should make you uncomfortable about voting , so get more knowledge. It’s like talking about the new season of Game of Thrones without knowing who the Lannisters are.
@TC_in_TDot @BridgetPhetasy “If you have nothing to hide” is a term used by police states to abuse the rights of an individual. Presumption of innocence is completely ignored if you can just investigate people based on “he drank at college”. Historically, this doesn’t end well.

@Kbkev78 @crustysails @politico Polygraph isn’t admissible and court, and we don’t know the questions. All witnesses have either denied it happening or say they weren’t there. The FBI is not a hail-Mary you call to look for evidence. You need evidence to justify an investigation.

@political_ellie @autumnhklein Absolutely. Focus on the evidence alone. Making excuses not only admits guilt when there is no corroborated evidence, but also demeans other cases of assault or harassment by making them excusable. If they occurred, they are simply not excusable using such statements.
@Slate And I assume by “diminish” you mean attempt to reduce the importance of, not the occurrence of, sexual violence?
@Slate This is absurd. Hillary Clinton diminished sexual violence, as she smeared those with evidence of harassment or assault. Ford, regardless of whether her accounts are accurate or not, is not supported by any corroborated evidence, yet the court of public opinion has ruled guilty.

@chuckwoolery It’s absurd. How can the accused go first when they’re not aware of the details of what they’re being accused of?! It’s insane.
@Slate The fact is that this is occurring, as we all know, during a high-level federal proceeding, and so it’s natural and logical to have deadlines, otherwise this could (and would) be dragged out for months, for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons.
@chuckwoolery Unfortunately, it looks like the bluff was called. We should hold the hearing, analyze the evidence, and make a decision, not let this charade of the court of public opinion and biased smearing on both sides continue any further.

@Mendelpol Agree in rule of law completely, there has to be a consistent metric. I think trials for such things are difficult, but if there’s sufficient evidence that you’ve engaged in military activity with enemies of the state, you should be either barred or arrested on re-entry.
@RStomel @Daniel_Sugarman Jews are selectively white or Zionist, often to the advantage of those who wish to criticize them based on membership of either supposed “non-victim” groups
@Mendelpol The fact that they have any chance of an option to come back is ridiculous. Fighting for enemy states is literally treasonous

@TianaTheFirst And that’s the problem. People assume these two are mutually exclusive, and to take an allegation seriously is to assign blame, and to assume innocence is to disregard an allegation.
@SenGillibrand And yet you’re happy to smear Kavanaugh before the evidence has been heard and judged. Smearing either characters is objectively bad, so why don’t we look solely at the evidence and THEN judge?

@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein That’s fair enough 🙂
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein But again, I say that in the article. If the goal is to change people’s mind, then using needlessly inflammatory, emotive, aggressive terminology seems counterproductive.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I use “the Holocaust” at all times. I don’t think terms like the Holocaust should be off limits. They should be off limits when you are a) trying to change minds, b) based on logical premises that both sides agree upon. Otherwise it’s just divisive and inflammatory. https://t.co/XpdaHPbG8a
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein And I feel we’ve come full circle, I’ve addressed all of this in the article.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein See part 2! 😂
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein 2) and I’d be a little more willing to accept the usage of “holocaust” if the context of its usage wasn’t genocide-related or “The Holocaust”, which unfortunately is how it’s used in a lot of cases.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein 1) Ah sorry I didn’t realize it was specific to Holocaust. In that case, I think the word has enough modern connection with “The Holocaust” that it’s reasonable to assume that when it’s used, it’s referring to the event and not the original definition.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I think it is, regardless of opinions held. An extreme example of this: there is a debate regarding whether the world is flat or round, despite most believe it is clearly round. However, saying “there’s no debate” isn’t a way of proving a flat-worlder wrong in a logical way.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I agree that “most” is an exaggeration, but by most I meant it’s possible to make an argument for most, not that most are, if that makes sense. Again, I think the dehumanization argument is a logically sound argument, but again  that doesn’t mean genocide.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein And here’s the problem. I wasn’t entering a pro-life/pro-choice debate. None of the article included an opinion on abortion. Just questioning the logic and effectiveness of using such language to advocate for pro-life views.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein “Most” and “can be” are he important parts in my sentence. Punching someone can be seen as an act of assumed superiority. And yes, the word was used before. But so were many words that now have inflammatory meanings, and doesn’t counter the article’s argument.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein Then this works both ways, it’s possible for pro-lifers to criticize abortion in isolation without having to compare to genocide or The Holocaust. It’s really the logical leap to that comparison that I have a problem with, not general pro/anti abortion opinions.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein But there is a real widespread medical debate regarding what constitutes life, while there is no legitimate medical debate regarding standards within post-birth humans.	Again, I understand the arguments, but it’s too large a leap to jump to genocide.
@JodiKoberinski @MarkDice Well then Bailey’s seems much more appropriate!
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I can understand that viewpoint, but I still think it’s too large a leap from that to “The Holocaust” or “genocide”. Really most physical crimes against a person can be defined as dehumanizing or assertion of superiority.
@SenGillibrand The FBI make the decision whether they should investigate or not, and since the accusations are not a federal crime, they are not obligated to investigate, so implying that this is tantamount to silencing Dr. Ford is incorrect, regardless of whether her accusations are true.
@Rlynnd1 @michaeljknowles I expected no less. I also expected no more. Writing nothing seems to be @michaeljknowles calling. 😂

@HashCigarette Clearly I’m not assimilated enough into American vocab...I didn’t realize that following someone who was willing to engage in conversation even though it’s clear we disagree on a fundamental level had such implications....
@HashCigarette Base?
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro I can see that we’re not going to find a middle point that’s sufficient, given that you excuse everything bad about socialism with capitalism. Yet another “socialism has never been tried” view that I disagree with at a foundational level. I did enjoy talking though! 😊
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro The problem I have is that people ignore that no true socialist society has ever achieved anything except death and poverty. Racist cartoons are clearly bad, but I haven’t advocated for that, and nor does capitalism. Socialism results have been shown to be devastating every time.
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro And yes the “full gone” was a brain fart 😂😂
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro And your assumption that socialism and communism have no connection to racism is nothing short of naive...
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro I’m afraid that I do; which is why I’m pretty vocally against it.
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro Firstly, the “how” is the immoral part. Secondly, I think it’s not a full gone conclusion that those are good things. Certainly the lack of the bad sides of states and a class system are bad. But the advantages of a hierarchy are that you can climb it, as opposed to stagnating
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro Ah there we’ll have to disagree there. I think communism is immoral on a large scale if forced upon everyone, which it is by necessity it groups larger than families in most instances
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro Oh I see. I made a comment about socialism, and that turned into a “socialism or communism” conversation.
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro I think patriotism can be positive. However, my statement was not engaging in a conversation about the pros/cons of nationalism, as I’m not a nationalist, so I’m yet to hear an argument regarding my original statement
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro What I was going to say was “...I don’t understand why I’m being pushed as an advocate for nationalism by criticizing socialism, which is what I said in my first response”.
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro I’m very sorry, I began typing, had to put my phone down, and accidentally sent the tweet. It came across as dismissive and disrespectful, and for that I apologize.
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro ...
@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro What people have to learn is that not everything should be a binary choice. Yes, parts of nationalism are bad. That’s a completely illogical argument to use in favor of socialism.
@Fair_and_Biased @harleykesselman @autumnhklein Thank you @Fair_and_Biased for being so open to listening to the reasons! It’s honestly refreshing, I’ve been accused of being a “pro-deather” because I’ve criticized the use of “Holocaust” or “genocide” while expressing no pro-life OR pro-choice views.
@sherpayy @benshapiro Socialism is the road to communism, and is based on the same immoral principles

@duncaninla @stephenpollard Ironic use of the word “shrill”...I think? I’m not sure I understand irony.
@cam_wallaceee Why?
@MacKurva @SenFeinstein I disagree there. There shouldn’t be a statue of limitations for reporting the assault. However, there is no reason for Feinstein to withhold the information except for political. There’s a difference. Feinstein is not an alleged victim.
@NuncVideo @KassyDillon Well how kind of you to take over both the meaning of the photos she chooses to post and her future! Even if your trolling, this is just silly.
@NuncVideo I’m not going to try and speak for @KassyDillon obviously, but her photo is clearly to counter the view that ARs shouldn’t be sold, not as a dating photo...?
@BrianTubbs @AsheSchow The word “believe” is subjective, but important in cases of accusations of sexual assault. It seems like research shows that not being believed is a barrier to many reporting their attack, so the language used is important. You can believe the accusation and then investigate.
@KayFellowz Agreed. The abuse of the movement by those who should be its biggest advocates is in no way representative of the movement itself.
@JamalDajani @meirohana1 Do you have links to examples of a Palestinian civilian being stabbed to death by an Israeli civilian and being portrayed by Israeli media as a militant? Just curious.
@KassyDillon His later claim is that if the roles were reversed (i.e. it was a Palestinian “militant” that was killed), the militancy would have been reported. W...t...f nothing like casual justification of murder of a civilian
@SenFeinstein We shouldn’t dispute the accusations and should look into this legally, as we should with all such accusations. However, maybe if you’d shared the information you had in July they’d have more time? Oh wait...
@Jim252525 @BrianTubbs @AsheSchow What’s a pro-deather?
@BrianTubbs @AsheSchow Huh? Believe the accuser means not dismissing their accusation and following legal procedures of investigation...none of that impacts the presumption of innocence.
@glitterelf @Tranny_Bane @cam_wallaceee We need to acknowledge that it’s possible to believe the accuser and follow procedure AND question Feinstein’s motives and choice of timing.
@TomiLahren What people aren’t considering is that both can be true. The accusations can be true, but Feinstein’s timing can be political.
@RAMRANTS @AsheSchow The key point is that there will be a large enough group of people who think lie detector tests are legally admissible because they’re used in CSI or SVU.
@AinsleyBBrown I agree. It’s bad regardless of what element of history is being removed.
@AsheSchow I think the lines are being blurred here. We should be able to follow legal process and believe the accuser and address evidence, while also questioning Feinstein’s choice to withhold accusations for political reasons.
@diva3102 @ElishaKrauss For Feinstein to delay the accusations for any amount of time opens legitimate questions about her political tactics. This can be true while also believing the alleged victim and investigating. The speed of the process is not relevant when evidence is withheld for such crimes.
@benshapiro Exactly. It’s possible to both believe the accusations while waiting for evidence AND question Feinstein’s timing and motives for concealing such an accusation.
@benshapiro Which is exactly what both sides need to do. Evidence is what matters. When people start to make excuses based on his age at the time of the alleged assault, it implies guilt. We should also be able to listen to the accuser while also questioning Feinstein’s choice of timing.

@ElishaKrauss What’s disappointing here is the timing. If the accusations are true (and I think we need to remain ethical and believe all accusations with evidence) then Feinstein’s delay in releasing the information is troubling. If the accusations are false, then it damages #MeToo.

@Muddlebrick @davidallengreen The continual request for evidence when there is a huge amount of evidence already provided is nothing but an indication of the deep-seeded denial regarding Corbyn and #LabourAntisemitism

@CNNPolitics So he genuinely apologized, and yet people are still demonizing him, after calling for him to publicly apologize.
@KayFellowz Agreed. This is bad regardless of the perpetrator of victim. I think the solution is for the individuals targeted to vocally reject the bullying, viewers to stand up regardless of whether they agree with the victim’s views, and for companies to stand up also.
@haaretzcom While it’s legitimate to say “Five times Trump made decisions that Palestinians (or certainly Palestinian leadership) didn’t agree with”, using the word “targeted” is very subjective, especially regarding point 1 - US embassy.

@lyndseyfifield There are key details missing for people to gain enough perception of what happened to gauge guilt, certainly. But the detail that the shooter was in someone else’s home uninvited is quite different, unique enough to be of interest.

The implication is clear - socialism isn’t bad. Yes, they have socialist policies based on hugely successful capitalism. That’s not socialism.
@NoahPollak It’s also historically ignorant as shekels are an ancient unit of currency used by many cultures. You can’t just label someone as antisemitic because they use a commonly used, and non-derogatory, word as a term for “money”.
@daveanthony @RedwoodGirl Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden are not socialist countries. They’re capitalist countries. China, and Venezuela are socialist, however.
@KevinSMayfield @xan_desanctis Oh it wasn’t any implication on my part of an excuse. It was a question of why “off-duty” was used. This seems beyond awful if the report is true. Just awful.
@PardesSeleh @LisaAMoyer That’s a pretty common phrase, and isn’t anti-Semitic because shekels are an ancient unit of currency used by multiple cultures. I’m all out for calling out anti-semitism when it exists, or indeed all racism, but there has to be evidence. The word “shekels” is not evidence.
@RealSaavedra He's, like, so bad. https://t.co/U2E69VFw3X
@KayaJones While some in Hollywood may be racist, it’s hard to believe they’re the most racist people to work for...the KKK come to mind for instance.
@1776Stonewall To be fair, it’s just efficiency. If they criticize him now, they save so much time in the future to criticize other things that may or may not happen!
@xan_desanctis Off-duty means, I assume, not in uniform?
@BernieSanders To be fair, this is nothing new. GoFundMe is effectively a way of providing charity, and charity has been a way of supporting vulnerable people for a long time. So, in short, GoFundMe didn’t invent charity to support the medically in-need

@jordylancaster Law enforcement is a necessity for any successful democratic civilization that values the protection of an individuals rights, whereas some other government agencies are not. This isn’t to say skepticism isn’t important, but a reason why it’s not on the same level.

@MillerBombz @gbsedillo21 @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY I’m waiting to see if it will pay off 😉
@lizzywol Fearmongering, outrage-stirring, and worst: lies.
@MillerBombz @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Overall, I wish we had italics for Twitter instead of capitalization. It sounds less like screaming!!
@MillerBombz @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Fine thanks. I saw Trump use all capitals the other day and thought it looked fun 😂
@MillerBombz @GaryGoddmn @Ocasio2018 You literally pay for spending increases by increasing taxes...I agree that you have to talk about “paying” if you lower taxes but don’t lower spending. Personally I am not a fan of the tax cut IF partnered with stable or increased spending.
@MillerBombz @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Gillibrand or Clinton would be proud of that selective quote! I said the target IF NOT EXPLICITLY PROVIDED is irrelevant. She’s accusing SOME GROUP of being hateful without either evidence or specific naming of that group or individuals.
RT @redwhitebluex2: @montie @LowTaxChloe A Barrister...blaming the victim...awesome.
@medwoman1 @daren_barnett @kenjKage @SenGillibrand I think this is especially true when it comes to abortion, because the true core of the issue (from my understanding) is the definition of life. All arguments stem from that focal point of disagreement, and so talking about souls or choice etc don’t always apply across sides.
@medwoman1 @daren_barnett @kenjKage @SenGillibrand I think this is a case of arguing over issues that make assumptions for which there is no agreement. There’s no point arguing with/without the assumption of God if not all parties agree (for example) that God exists.
@MillerBombz @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY I think the target, if not explicitly provided, is irrelevant. It’s a competitive political post, so it’s fair to assume that the “they” are her political opponents, unless otherwise stated.
@medwoman1 @daren_barnett @kenjKage @SenGillibrand Again, this is a distraction from the original point. Your arguments are based on your assumptions of life, however, and aren’t a legitimate counter to anyone who disagrees on that assumption. It’s like arguing an atheist by citing the Bible.
@medwoman1 @kenjKage @daren_barnett @SenGillibrand But paths, by nature of their design, have limits and constrictions. The whole point of general law and order in a civilized society is to define these limits fairly to enable liberty for individuals without impacting other freedoms unnecessarily.
@Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Are you agreeing or disagreeing...? What I’m saying is that making a blanket statement about an entire “other”, I.e. “they”, are hateful is itself hateful because you are negatively labeling an entire group of individuals, something the Democrats correctly criticize.
@medwoman1 @kenjKage @daren_barnett @SenGillibrand I think this being warped into a debate on abortion is missing the original point. It’s not enough to follow your own views of morality because it opens the door for complete subjective morality to every obvious extreme. What’s important is not to assume moral superiority.
@nevvyz @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Why not? It’s a sweeping statement implying that a faceless “They” are hateful.
@the_edwin_mix @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY No it’s not. It’s a specific criticism of making general statements like “They hate”. I.e. broad accusation of general hatred.
RT @redwhitebluex2: @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Broad accusation of general hatred IS hatred.
@Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Broad accusation of general hatred IS hatred.
@ElishaKrauss @emzanotti I wrote an article along these lines! https://t.co/VDOUxzBj9z
@xan_desanctis The fact this has been so widely debunked and she STILL shamelessly writes this garbage is exactly why she lost.
@DavidAFrench It’s completely shameless. Sharing this days after the lie was first made, with so many resources showing it to be false. She’s a liar, and clearly incompetent!
@montie @LowTaxChloe A Barrister...blaming the victim...awesome.
@IngrahamAngle The competition for that position is fierce
@HillaryClinton You are willingly spreading lies about this entire event. He was citing a case, which you know. He was discussing the morning-after pill, which can prevent pregnancy post-fertilization. Stop spreading lies in the hope of outrage leading to your eventual power.
@xan_desanctis The second part - the fact he was citing - should be enough, regardless of the science. If we are in a world where quoting someone else means the same as saying it for yourself, every history class is in trouble.
@jenniferm_q She knows. That’s the scary part.
@xan_desanctis Imagine a world where high-ranking political figures don’t willingly spread lies in the pursuit of stirring up outrage, and instead focus on actual political policies....
@tom_watson @LowTaxChloe When many of the aggressive players in the political arena label everything as a “fight”, “war” or “battle”, or opposing viewpoints as violent, then violence or at least threat of violence begins to become acceptable, because it’s fighting violence with violence. It’s disgusting.
@robsmithonline When the aim is to spark outrage regardless of truth, you know their entire political strategy.
@xan_desanctis I just commented on this on her Instagram. Instead of focusing on legitimate areas of criticism, Hillary is trying to keep herself relevant by jumping on the train of spreading lies to spark outrage instead of providing actual political positions
@eddiemarsan Absolutely, this is the largest problem in every area of discourse today. It’s a battle for the assumption of moral superiority, regardless of actual views or data.
@skestenbaum My memory of the part of the Torah where Abraham leads Isaac to be sacrificed definitely included a stop at the local beer garden, and when they found the ram, they found a goat and let it jump on them while doing random poses. 🙄 you can’t sacrifice respect for membership.
@JSmithpolitics1 Seems like a pretty tenuous link, a rather desperate attempt some would say. Childhood rabbis aren’t usually the best source for up-to-date insights into the psyche of their once students...

@Ocasio2018 1) You don’t pay for tax cuts. They’re cuts. 2) True fiscal conservatives usually pair tax cuts with spending cuts because...basic economics. If you insist on continuing or raising spending, that’s when you need to be asking that question!
@bandlersbanter Even if we are enforcing censorship rules on things deemed to be facts, that’s not the fault of the fact they’re facts!!

@Alaynacalverley @ahlamhey I’m honestly not trying to argue your point, I would like to think this is quite a small number of people if we were able to look at real numbers.
@TheJordanRachel Absolutely. Spot on.
@DevinSenaUI In a slightly less abusive way than other replies, I agree that these are not similar enough to enough people to lump together with an equal level of venom, especially assisted suicide, which if anything gives the individual MORE rights than they currently hold.
@morganisawizard Plus you weren’t nearly angry or aggressive enough for that. I like my young-person legislation in the form of screaming
@morganisawizard SO TRUE 😂
@morganisawizard That sounds like someone who should be suggesting gun policy!!!
@rachel_morgan97 This is really just a horribly disrespectful example of Whataboutism.
@ahlamhey I’d be willing to bet that this is a pretty sweeping statement that does a disservice to many people who both associate “Never Forget” with 9/11 and don’t deflect segregation, racism, and slavery with such disrespectful language. Not on Twitter of course, but in reality.

@prageru @yoalexrapz @JimCarrey While vastly wealthy elites spouting the joys of socialism is ironic, I feel we fall into a trap by calling for them to donate all their money. Socialism is not charity, it’s government-enforced wealth distribution, and needs to be criticized as such, not cheap class warfare.
@TomiLahren These aren’t really related, and is bordering on blanket politicization of a tragedy.

@lolaa1956 @kenjKage @SenGillibrand To be fair, I didn’t accuse you personally of anything. Regarding your comment on “libtards”, it’s just as bad. I actually wrote an article on this that you might find interesting, basically don’t abuse people if you want to change their mind :) https://t.co/S4u2sZm7Ed
@xan_desanctis That’s a reliable source if ever I saw one!
@politicalelle Also the use of critical thinking to judge the value and goals of the protest, not just to blindly become outraged when instructed to do so.
@xan_desanctis The fact that it’s now fine to say that quoting a view is the same as having that view is INSANE.
@lolaa1956 @kenjKage @SenGillibrand I think what conservatives are tired of is being labeled as scum by many on the left, and then being expected to take their opinions seriously.
To all the people accusing me of being a #Nazi, or #AltRight, or a white supremacist this week...I’m signing off for #RoshHashanah. #ShanaTova, and see you on Tuesday!
Context: people are claiming that Kavanaugh thinks all birth control are abortion-inducing. He was actually quoting someone else, who had a problem with the morning-after pill. Primary sources are important. https://t.co/HSJeid7js5
Today I discovered that proving that #Kavanaugh did not say that all birth control are abortion-inducing meant it was acceptable to call be a white male who wants to control the genitals of women. Who needs evidence?! https://t.co/2rYCo3e3Wy
@UppityWomanBlog @SenGillibrand Classic Leftist tactic. Misquote someone, when you’re corrected, divert by accusing me of being someone who isn’t sympathetic for rape victims. This deflection and bullying tactic won’t work.
Shana Tovah to all my fellow Jews. May you have a sweet and healthy new year. #ShanaTovah #RoshHashanah
@UppityWomanBlog @SenGillibrand Debunked. The drugs being discussed were the morning-after pill. Primary sources are good. https://t.co/HSJeid7js5
@UppityWomanBlog @SenGillibrand Reminder: quoting someone else is not saying it yourself. If I said “Dan said ‘I like pie’”, we all know that does not mean I like pie.

@carl_laur @mzemilycain @Concordia This is bullying and extortion all in one. It’s absurd.
@zorro7787 @SenGillibrand While Rice Krispies University sounds amazing, does my lack of law school credentials in your opinion justify the abuse of the judicial system for legislative purposes? If the Supreme Court wasn’t abused by legislators, no-one would care about Kavanaugh.
@fuglydug @SenGillibrand One word for you: Whataboutism. The rules are the abuse of the SC to push through lesislation. I believe this regardless of whether the government is on the Left or Right. That’s not the purpose of the judicial system. You’re assuming I’m biased, but I am not.
@zorro7787 @SenGillibrand Hence legislation being pushed through by legislators. If it’s illegal by law, it can’t be done. If it’s legal by law, it can. But don’t force legislative matters to the SC to avoid responsibility. It’s an abuse of the judicial system.
@fran13641 @kenjKage @SenGillibrand Is this statement based on reliable statistics, or are you just speaking for a vast proportion of the population without evidence?
After more polite conversation regarding Palestinian aid with @TheFrauBlau, Craig added me to another threatening list. I hate to block people, but he’s now blocked. It says a lot that I’m added to these kinds of lists when I’m expressing moderate conservative views... https://t.co/1Q16Ch2pIW
@LaciWilliams10 In all seriousness, I’m not a fan of these nano news cycles. Nothing matters for very long; which tends to mean nothing really matters...
@BarryMoskow @MDScienceMom @medwoman1 @SenGillibrand If we focused on my second point, which is for legislators to legislate and judges to judge, no-one would have anything to be so concerned or faux-outraged about. You can’t abuse a system to your benefit and then be enraged when it might not go your way. The system is broken.
@xan_desanctis This entire mess is a result of losing sight of what the judicial branch is for. It’s been treated as a legislation cheat-code for decades, and for legislators to avoid taking any responsibility or risk
@AymanM These two cuts are not comparable. Objectivity and context is important here. The first cuts are justifiable due to the politicization of refugee status and misuse of funds. The second cuts are, in my opinion, hard to justify.
@LaciWilliams10 It’s certainly busy work for our thumbs!

@bailnicole Can you provide context? What does better treatment mean, and who is being talked about with regards to “more pay”?
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman Universally true!!!
@RoamingMil I think this is an excellent point. In my mind, it depends on the severity and frequency of their extremism. If someone has a mixture of reasonable and controversial statements, yes. However, if the agreeable statement is alone in a sea of garbage, no.
While @TheFrauBlau and I have respectful and civil discussion, I’m apparently a terrorist. Glad @CraigY704 was there to tell me! Or maybe it’s just a list of people who might be interested in watches for terrorists? Who knows at this point 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/owyI3RbgSO
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman 👍🏻 My impression has been that some cuts have been more justified than others. For example, I was generally supportive of the UNRWA cuts based on demonstrated fund misuse, but this new example seems far less justifiable at first glance.
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman Absolutely, while I’m generally pro-Israel, it would be wrong not to acknowledge that there are real victims on both sides of this hugely complex situation. Thank you for the link, I’ll read it later, and thank you for the genuine civility.
@KayaJones Literally not the definition of treason. It can be bad politically, but criticizing Trump is not treason. He’s not King.
@xan_desanctis Is that your opinion or are you quoting someone else’s statement? Who am I kidding, it doesn’t matter apparently.
@realannapaulina Can you provide some more context?
@RagingGayCons Seagulls aren’t arrogant enough for that analogy. Try a peacock or a flamingo.
@trilll_nate @Kesterdaughter Certainly a lack of sympathy
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman I have no doubt that people are suffering as a results of these cuts. If you have the sources you’ve read, I’d be genuinely interested in reading them for more info and context. However, there’s also a reason Arafat was a multi-millionaire while his people lived in poverty.
@BrittMcHenry What were her statements? Some more context would be helpful
@SarahKSilverman So @SenFeinstein got the political stunt she wanted.
@endofanerajc Drugs can kill you. But statements are made for a reason, and statements like that given the context and timing are more than the words alone. @bailnicole understands this, and is just a provocateur.
@nypost It’s possible to both criticize Serena’s behavior during the game AND commend her for congratulating her opponent in defeat. She wasn’t a sore loser.
@trilll_nate @Kesterdaughter These kind of “serves you right” comments are just so needlessly inflammatory. Got to wonder what the purpose of them is.
@KamalaHarris But you said you wouldn’t vote for him regardless, do you think these documents will change your mind? Also, were you concerned when the Democrats abuses the Supreme Court to force through legislation?
@marklutchman He’d also have better passing stats than Kaepernick too...
@SarahKSilverman The PLO calling this poliical blackmail is the height of irony given their history regarding the use of foreign funds. While I feel truly terrible for the people who are affected by these cuts, some money doesn’t go to these people. It is at least part-funding continued violence.

@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump This type of “ergo decedo” argument doesn’t actually solve anything. It’s important for conservatives that we debate specific issues openly. Telling people to get out isn’t a way of growing conservatism. It’s a way of alienating people who disagree.
@bailnicole I have to disagree. While prison is indeed meant to punish, there is a difference between government-approved punishment that follows rules and chaotic anarchy that leaves people to fend for themselves. Doesn’t make us much better if we disregard the rights of the vulnerable.
@redsteeze “Checks and balances blah blah blah, now let’s abuse the judicial system to force through legislation”
@endofanerajc In what context? Not being snarky, just interested in more info
@SenGillibrand Firstly, there is no evidence of this. Secondly, this should be a lesson to push legislation through legislators and not the judiciary. You made the most of a Left-leaning Supreme Court, you have to play by the rules of the game you’ve abused.

@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I won’t be bullied. This is your trick. To force me to defend myself based on no evidence. Nothing I have said relates to black lives, racism or hatred of women. I will not be bullied by an angry person who throws disgusting and irrelevant accusations. Goodbye!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Accusations aren’t evidence. I know my own views. My own views are very clear, as you yourself has sad. I’m proud to own my views.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I know my own views. My own views are very clear, as you yourself has sad. I’m proud to own my views.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 😂 what are you asking me? Copy paste as much as you want, but I’m fairly sure anything I say will be unacceptable to you. How do I prove to you that I’m not racist when there’s no evidence that I am in the first place?
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Well you’re the expert. Until today I didn’t know I was a racist sexist bigot homophobe who hates everyone. I’m pretty lost. I’m certainly not ashamed of my views as there’s nothing to be ashamed by.

@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I know. This is amazing for my daily stats. Every time you say you’re going to leave is great news for me because I know 20 comments are coming in a few minutes.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 What are you asking me? Am I a Trump supporter? No I’m not. I’m a conservative. None of my replies on this entire thread have been about Trump. Or racism. Or sexism. Or women. Or any of the other things you’ve accused me of.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I’m amazed my rating from you is that high. Thank you again!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Thanks for reading my stuff though!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Remind me how it’s racist to mock Kaepernick for being bad at a sport or laughing when Zina Bash is accused of being a white supremicist for scratching her arm? Surely you can’t see that this is mildy absurd
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I thought you left the conversation two times. I’m not going to defend myself against bullying or misinformed insults. Looking forward for your third return! What will I be accused of next week, ladies and gentlemen? Killing puppies?
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 This is embarrassing. I truly hope you’re a troll. To accuse me of all of these things with zero evidence is ridiculous

@michaeljknowles I went to Disney Land once. I’m therefore Mickey Mouse.
@chris08018 @shaynaEjames Yeah it’s a big problem. The ability to deal with views you disagree with calmly is crucial
@chris08018 @shaynaEjames I think many Leftists (not all, which is important to remember) definitely get aggressive when ideas are questioned, because every idea is based on the personal assumption of the moral high-ground. I’ll keep trying because it’s important that arguments are logical and objective!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 This is why progress is so hard. I genuinely do want discussion, and nowhere have I talked about my or your pro-life or pro-choice views, just the logic that arguments are based upon. But you just want a fight, and label me as someone who is trolling you. It’s a real pity.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I’ve watched Planet of the Apes. Caesar is pretty darn clever after all
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Wait, I thought we were done? Maybe you could define what you meant by Trumpanzee to clear up any confusion? I took it as a Trump voter/supporter (I am neither), with the intellectual capacity of a chimpanzee (which is probably false, depending on the chimpanzee).
@CassandraRules @JacobAWohl He’s definitely the best on CNN.
@chris08018 @shaynaEjames It’s just bait. I didn’t rise to it. Because I really DO care about real discussion.
@shaynaEjames As said on our other conversation: Goodbye. I’m disappointed that you weren’t able to see what I was saying through your assumptions about who I am, what I believe, and why I’m taking the time to talk to you.
@shaynaEjames Goodbye. I’m disappointed that you weren’t able to see what I was saying through your assumptions about who I am, what I believe, and why I’m taking the time to talk to you.
It’s a shame as I’m actually interested in real discussion. But apparently I’m a twat who voted for Trump (can’t vote - 🇬🇧) who hates women. This is going to be an uphill battle but I’m going to keep trying. Real, respectful discussion is the route to change. #redwhitebluex2 https://t.co/CoTxz9o2pZ
@shaynaEjames Ultimately, a debate can exist as long as there are multiple viewpoints on a topic, without making any valuations on validity of the debate arguments. For example, the world is flat. A debate exists because some believe the world is flat, even though my feelings are pretty set 🌎
@shaynaEjames I can understand why you feel that way. But many reasonable debates DO exist as there are undeniably people who disagree with you. The fact you don’t respect their views doesn’t make the debate not exist. Thank you for being slightly less rude, we might be getting somewhere!
@cam_wallaceee This type of grandstanding is beyond ridiculous. If you want laws, push them through legislature. Don’t use the judiciary as a political cheat-code and then be annoyed when the Republicans get the controller!

@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand And trust me, as a Jew, I might have a grasp of what it’s like to be discriminated against. However, that doesn’t make my views right or wrong! You think I think I’m a victim. My words are what I stand behind, not my intersectional group.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand The subject was Gillibrand’s comment that no debate exists due to safety provided by abortion. I said that a debate does exist. You start talking about women controlling their bodies. I would love to stay on topic.
@shaynaEjames Call me all the names you want. A debate exists when there are sides who disagree. This is a logical fact, not a political opinion. So to say a debate doesn’t exist is absolutist. Yes I’m a fragile Jewish white man...doesn’t make me wrong.
@shaynaEjames Oh, and that I’m some horrible person who doesn’t care about maternal death rates. So I guess I can throw “mother killer” into the mix. None of this is relevant to my original statement which wasn’t even pro-life or pro-choice!
@shaynaEjames So let me get this...I said that a debate exists...because there are people who disagree. You’ve called me “you men”, “obtuse”, “white guys”, “fragile”, “tool”...and I haven’t been aggressive to you personally once, but I’m disrespectful? 😂
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand Classic Left-ist tactic there. Assume I don’t care, regardless of any evidence that supports your claim. You are making one other key assumption. You’re assuming I’m pro-life, when I’ve said nothing of the sort. Acknowledging that a debate exists is not the same as disagreeing!
@autumnhopeklein So much neuroticism...
@shaynaEjames I also think that “you women” could be deemed offensive by some, given that “you X” is offensive in many scenarios; such as “You Jews”. It’s making a sweeping statement about an entire group...which personally I think isn’t all that acceptable
@shaynaEjames Wait, so I’m Jewish. What intersectional box do I fit into? I’m not being fragile, I’m making pretty objective and respectful statements, and all you’re trying to do is distract and attack. My original statement was referring to Gillibrand’s statement.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand I’m trying to improve the narrative and speak respectfully with people about such a difficult and emotive topic. Being disrespectful, and quite frankly sexist, to me makes that quite difficult.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand 4) @autumnhopeklein saw this debate earlier. I, nor my sex, are legislating anything. Legislation based on abortion obviously applies to biological females because biological females CAN have abortions while biological men can’t.	5) all of these are facts without being pro-life.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand 1) you’re assuming my position on abortion, when all I did was question someone’s absolutist view. 2) yes I am aware, but that’s also an illogical argument - using the rare and specific to legislate the broad and general. 3) many women are pro-life...
“You men” should be as unacceptable as “you women”. They are both derogatory terms that I would never consider using. What’s even more ridiculous is that I wasn’t even stating a view about abortion! #EqualityforAll #Feminism https://t.co/cSAEQXdbZh
@JSmithpolitics1 @DailyCaller (I actually live in the US) 😂 I’m not sure I’d agree they need a Donald Trump figure. I’m not a giant fan of fighting fire with fire, because all it leads to is each side rushing towards radicalism. It is hard to see an alternative in the current climate sometimes though.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand Two problems. Firstly, I was responding to Gillibrand’s assertion that abortion is to protect their lives, yet you’re posing a different debate regarding control of their bodies, which I made no statement about. Secondly, “you men”?
@JSmithpolitics1 @DailyCaller I truly hope so. UK politics is becoming increasingly far-Left too. It’s deeply worrying
@DailyCaller @JSmithpolitics1 The problem is, are they embarrassing themselves? What worries me more is that while we on the Right are laughing, a lot of those on the far-Left are digging their heels in, becoming more radical, more outraged, more extreme.
@heyyitsbev_ Some pretty strong America-centric arrogance from the Left there...
@ElishaKrauss @realDailyWire @michaeljknowles @benshapiro Some things are just going too far. This is almost as offensive as the original with Kaepernick 😂
@TheEllenShow @cher @ellentube Or do what Cher did. Buy a new butt.
@andrewjaygreene @BretBaier The Eagles won the super bowl last year. I watched it happen. Does that mean I am the reason they won? Not the most solid logical argument Barack...
@ChrisWrightActs @autumnhopeklein It’s important not to get off-topic. Technically, the cells forming are a combination of the father and mother’s cells...so it’s at least slightly more complicated than a single cell-ownership situation
@benshapiro Haha! Stupid men. 🙄
@KamalaHarris This is why legislators should legislate and judges should judge. Your fear of losing Roe v Wade was caused by the abuse of the judicial system to force through legislation outside of the proper channels. The SC isn’t a weapon to wield to create law.
@SenGillibrand There is a debate. Being so absolutist and then demonizing those who are equally absolutist just furthers divisions on an already divisive topic. Acknowledge there is a debate and then discuss!
@austentatious24 @HeyItsSteveYo @DevinSenaUI No worries! Thanks for listening
@HeyItsSteveYo @austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI No problem. :) my comment should have been more clear. Glad we can be civil, go us!
@austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI I’m agreeing with @DevinSenaUI that the arguments people use are lazy and illogical!
@austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI No not at all, just the logical argument of “if you don’t like X, don’t do X”, because you can care about issues beyond your own actions. I’m agreeing with @DevinSenaUI!
@HeyItsSteveYo @austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI You’re trying to bait and deflect by implying I think the comparison of abortion and slavery is illogical. If you read what I said, it was pointing out that the “don’t get one” is illogical. You can care about an issue BEYOND your own actions. Are those words small enough?
@KamalaHarris Stop telling everyone what to do...?
@autumnhopeklein Because he’s a sanctimonious hypocrite.
@dianeeldredge99 I don’t know, he just HIT his daughter on national TV! The guy has no shame!
@BernieSanders Pandering time!
@autumnhopeklein Unfortunately, it’s not childish, but more of a commonly used strategy to deflect and destroy debates. Bring an entire broad area down based on specific and rare scenarios.
Suck it, #harvard. Beautiful day in @UniofOxford @WorcCollegeOx . #oxford #oxforduniversity #worcestercollege https://t.co/PMgPsopYCB
@ChrisWrightActs @autumnhopeklein This kind of logic, regardless of what side of the abortion debate you fall, is irrelevant, and over simplified. The issue is clearly not the woman or the uterus. The issue is clearly what is in the uterus. This logic tries to dismiss specific and relevant debate
@ARmastrangelo Agree completely. Ideology needs to be consistent, otherwise we’re in the scenario of “I’m ok with a dictator as long as they do what I want”
@iwasid @ThisIsGaZa @AsaWinstanley I’m responding directly to the exact language, and you’re not responding to what I’m saying, just following the same old phrases. Unfortunately, this is not worth my time.
@DevinSenaUI It's a very lazy and illogical argument. I think this is one example of a political flip-issue - the Left want no government involvement based on impacting an individual's rights, and the Right want government involvement based on enforcing an individual's rights.
@iwasid @ThisIsGaZa @AsaWinstanley You’re deliberately misconstruing what I’m saying. There is a difference between racism existing in a country, and a country being based on racism. They’re clearly different, and you’re willingly ignoring that key difference
@jeremycorbyn This would be more exciting if it hadn’t previously been under public ownership, and with such disastrous results. The complete lack of investment or maintainence still affects us today
@Migraine_nay @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI No worries! I know a lot of people on Twitter are out to argue, so I know I’m slightly unusual for just being genuinely interested 😃
@Migraine_nay @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI Yes but I wasn’t disputing it’s validity, I was asking about the gospels specifically because the gospels were used to define whether you could believe in abortion.
Trololololololololol https://t.co/p8AejVe9Zh
@ElishaKrauss True mastery. 👌🏻 you know what’s amazing though? So many people won’t get the joke. “She’s admitting she’s a white supremacist!”
@TianaTheFirst This is pretty much unbeatable trolling
@BernieSanders More fear mongering based on no evidence whatsoever. It’s like you all planned for a crazy, rapist-cult, Nazi, so when #Kavanaugh showed up, you couldn’t be bothered to come up with a new plan so just went with it anyway
@TheDailyShow @Trevornoah Wrong emojis. You meant 🐂💩
@LaciWilliams10 @rep_md2016 The real issue is that he is a direct demonstration of how virtue signaling is what many people now value. Just be outraged, emotional, and aggressive in so-called defense, and people will rally to you. It’s bizarre
@LaciWilliams10 All wonderful choices of course 😱😱😱
@LaciWilliams10 No, luckily he’s just doing some major PR stunt work. It’s between Sanders, Harris, Booker and Warren.
@LaciWilliams10 Remember. Linda Sarsour could also run. Or Avenetti. My money, however, is on Stormy Daniels
@LaciWilliams10 I see your Booker and I raise you an Ocasio-Cortez
@rep_md2016 @LaciWilliams10 Haha! You’re right, that’s even worse.
@LaciWilliams10 This metaphor will come to life if Booker gets to the presidential run and has to debate Trump. It’ll be brutal
@LaciWilliams10 He was actually the kid who thought he was cool because he broke rules...rules that were removed the night before
@Acosta Are you upset that the #KavanaghHearing is literally stealing all of your thunder?
@chrislhayes We should be truly thankful for the 140 character limit at times...
@RealJamesWoods The “chewing gum” words can be removed and this statement remains the same.
@BernieSanders The redefinition of undocumented/illegal immigrants as “immigrants” is offensive to legal immigrants. It doesn’t harm your overall case of a compassionate position if you use the correct terminology. It may prevent the division you yourself are causing.
@sienknox Some things you just can’t say. 😭
@RubYaWrong @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI This is a general problem with debating outside of the same religion or with those who don’t believe in a religion. Using your own religious texts as proof isn’t the best way of making others change their mind. It’s like me quoting the Talmud to you.
Hey gang. Remember @OMAROSA? Me neither. Cool. #Omarosa #newscycle
@jdawsey1 Nothing more heroic than assault on an innocent person...🙄🙄🙄
@SenGillibrand ...But until we can do these things, let’s just form online mobs and bully people into submission. Maybe accuse people at random of being members of rapist cults, or better yet, full-on Nazis!
@RubYaWrong @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI 😂 kind of hard to quote both the Old and New Testament as evidence, and then try and convince me to eat bacon which the Old Testament forbids. Let’s avoid that!
@josh_hammer He’s talking about the band, right?
@realDailyWire https://t.co/Y4Co9AIj0W
@mwest410 @BernieSanders Which means that legislation needs to be specific...the fact that everything gets punted to the judiciary is just laziness on the side of the legislators. That’s not how it’s designed to work.
@RubYaWrong @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI Thank you, but I’m not looking for a new religion right now. I just love challah way too much
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI @MBlanchie Thank you for apologizing. I was honestly asking out of genuine interest. I understand that it’s such an emotive topic, and so much conversation surrounding it is aggressive to begin with. I’m trying my best to change that!
@MikePJD Are they mutually exclusive? 😂
@BernieSanders Based on what evidence? The amount of fear you constantly peddle is absurd. If you want laws you can uphold, push them through legislature, not the judiciary.
@MBlanchie @RubYaWrong @DevinSenaUI Very interesting, thank you.
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI Furthermore, it’ll only alienate those who disagree with you, making it less likely for them to ever change their mind. If that’s what you truly desire, it will pay dividends if you engage respectfully when people are genuinely interested and ask real questions
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI My questions have focused on the gospel, and @MBlanchie took my interest seriously and we had a productive and respectful and relevant conversation. Just being aggressive and ignoring my genuine question doesn’t encourage open discussion
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI Thank you @MBlanchie :), that’s interesting. Thank you also for taking my genuine questions seriously, unfortunately it was not done elsewhere by others on this thread!
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI Why are you getting defensive? I’m genuinely interested in learning about abortion from the perspective of the gospel, as mentioned in the original tweet. You’re treating me as if I’m disrespecting your beliefs or disagreeing with you!
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI I know the word abortion isn’t in the Bible, but I was just genuinely curious if there were any specifically applicable parts in the gospels given the original claim that the gospel is incompatible with being pro-abortion.
@Slate https://t.co/Y4Co9AIj0W
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI But is there anything in the gospels that is applicable to abortion, or is it mostly referencing Old Testament statements?
@scrowder I think it was you! 🙄😂
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI That’s the Old Testament too
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI That’s Old Testament, no? I was just interested in hearing any specifics in the gospels.

@michelleisawolf You’re about as funny on Twitter as you were on your show. Trustworthiness is determined on his judicial record, which is both fully available and consistently solid. You can’t just label someone as untrustworthy with no evidence
@JCNSeverino @xan_desanctis Bullying is applauded when it’s used by the left.
@ShannonBream For someone who knows the history, she asks a lot of judicially irrelevant questions
@ShannonBream Everything she’s doing is based on getting his personal opinions in the form of “gotchas”. This is the price that has to be paid when the judiciary are used as legislators.
@BernieSanders This doesn’t exactly settle the case that Roe v Wade is solid judicially does it? Maybe do what was meant and pursue legislation using legislators, rather than forcing it through the judiciary?
@KamalaHarris He refused to answer because all of your leading questions are not judicial and have clear political implications you’re trying to trick him with. Your continued updates are ridiculous, hardly any of them focus on judicial factors. They’re all attempted “gotchas”
@iwasid @ThisIsGaZa @AsaWinstanley Are you talking about Israel, or all of its surrounding countries? If Israel, there are reasonable arguments regarding the so-called one nation law being racist. But to say the entire state is racist when Israel is made up of multiple faiths, races, and ethnicities is absurd.
@KamalaHarris @CoryBooker @mazieforhawaii Why do you care about these documents when you have already said you won't vote for him?
Ironically, I used some complete sentences that she really didn’t like. If someone with an upside-down flag blocks you, you probably said something sensible https://t.co/BySIofYBh4

@guypbenson She’s abusing a logical fallacy to try and make a cheap point. Rather than debating abortion objectively, she’s trying to imply that because there are no laws regarding “men” having abortions, there should be no laws for “women” regarding abortions. One...small...flaw
Quite a few Bachelor quotes thrown in there. I do HATE it when people are here for the wrong reasons. https://t.co/yYj5EY6Ntf
@historBilia @KamalaHarris My later comment addresses this. I’m not arguing with your conclusion, I’m arguing against the logic of her argument to get to that conclusion. There is a difference. The abortion debate doesn’t need logical fallacies to be reasonable and effective.
@Silence17Dogood @KamalaHarris Please don’t assume I’m arguing for a pro-life position. I’m focusing on the logical fallacy Kamala Harris is using to drive a political narrative. Her question was illogical, I’m not making any statement about her conclusion.
@historBilia @KamalaHarris I’m not trying to make an abortion debate. It’s a comment on how her statement makes no logical sense. I’m saying that the two sexes (based on her definition) are different based on their ability to host a fetus, and therefore aren’t exactly the same in the way she’s implying.
@davidhogg111 https://t.co/Y4Co9AIj0W
And the asinine statement of the year goes to... #KamalaHarris! https://t.co/IN5pC8p2j9
@KamalaHarris This...is...ridiculous. If both sexes could give birth, this would be a valid statement. But since the only laws regard abortion, and only people with fetuses in their womb are “female” (given @KamalaHarris uses “male body”), then of course they only apply to females.

@lulu_says2 @KamalaHarris His job is in the judicial branch. To interpret written laws, not give personal opinions. The question was not about a law, it was a leading question with a clear political agenda regarding people on both sides in Charlottesville. You can’t call people racist with no evidence.
@KamalaHarris Well I guess that means he’s clearly a white supremacist. OR that he’s remaining impartial, otherwise known as his job. Stop spreading misinformation that judges are legislators.

@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins Read what I said. I made no assumption of which side. But clearly you have a side by your language implying stupidity at not understanding the “obvious answer”. If you’re not on one side or the other, why label others as stupid?
@cbns007 @DevinSenaUI I am truly limited by the 140 characters lol!! That sounds like a crazy idea 😂 the number of people who genuinely want to adopt is always so upsettingly high too.
@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins Your analogy doesn’t apply because abortion being right/wrong is an ethically-based opinion, not a matter of physics. Falling as a result of gravity is evidence that it exists. Calling someone stupid for not believing in gravity is not.
@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins Yes...but we’re not trying to convince people that gravity exists are we? If your goal is to change their opinion on abortion, which I assume it is, then what makes you think calling them stupid will help?
@cbns007 @DevinSenaUI Conversely, abortion is cheap because it’s pretty simple, especially in the early stages of pregnancy.
@cbns007 @DevinSenaUI I know adoption costs more, I wasn’t disputing that. But because adoption should be WORTH more doesn’t mean it shouldn’t cost more. Logistically, adoption is much more complex, we can’t just hand out kids for free without checking who is adopting them, for example.
@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins But the problem there is that your answer is divisive. It alienated both those who strongly disagree with whatever your view is, and makes it less likely that you’re going to convince the undecided. Calling people stupid is not a way to change minds
@LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins A debate between two completely opposed sides with no room to budge sounds like a bit of a waste of time to me. I’d rather focus on conversations with people in the middle who have reasonable opinions in either direction...

@DJBurn77 @SenGillibrand What has this got to do with asking a judicial nominee to make legislative promises...? I’m not debating bias, good try though.

@JerryDunleavy @KevinMcMahonYAF Wow. It’s almost like this was orchestrated for political impact...?
@Emma4Change Luckily, well-mannered 4 year olds aren’t qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. Judges with solid histories of just judicial decisions are. And let’s not talk about manners when Kavanaugh and his children were heckled and bullied throughout the hearing.
@SenWarren Yeah! Mob rule! Bullying is great if you’re the bully
@LoConservative The purpose of the judiciary is that it’s apolitical. So even if all of the lies about Kavanaugh were true, and he was the devil himself, his solid judicial history is all that matters, not his personal views. But it only works in one direction when RGB is lauded as a Dem hero.
@SenTedCruz If Trump nominated Obama to the seat, and Obama said one good thing about Trump, they’d be calling Obama an enemy of the people. This is all so deeply absurd.
@DavidRutz @redsteeze 1) he didn’t refuse the handshake. 2) if he did, you’re assuming reason and intent. 3) if your assumptions were correct, that’s his right as a citizen. 4) his rights and views would have no impact on his judicial decisions with his demonstrated history of just decisions. STOP IT
@AmySwearer @Heritage It’s like that age-old saying: assume they’re a white supremacist until told otherwise
@wyndovelh @lauren_hoggs @davidhogg111 @fred_guttenberg There is no clear evidence that he “refused” the handshake. After being bullied and heckled for hours, perhaps he felt somewhat uneasy about being approached by people he didn’t know, and security ushered him away. Unfortunately, you know this, but just don’t care
@lauren_hoggs @fred_guttenberg Yes. They could care less. The phrase is “couldn’t care less”. I’m sure that as a parent of children himself, he doesn’t care about gun violence whatsoever. 🙄 This sort of lazy smearing is disgusting. This is not literal proof.

@KamalaHarris @TheDemocrats Judges should be apolitical, yet you openly celebrate Democrat judges like RGB. What’s the difference? Perhaps you shouldn’t assume that someone with a solid JUDICIAL record will suddenly throw that away for personal viewpoints.
@andyharnik @realDonaldTrump @AP Doesn’t everyone see how beyond laughable this is? Taking something that could be a simple misunderstanding and blowing it up to smear #Kavanaugh as someone who hates the parent of a shooting victim. It’s absurd.
@JDVance1 People need to stop rising to the bait. It’s obvious she’s not giving any kind of sign. By needlessly defending her, we are acknowledging that the accusations are even slightly warranted. It should be laughed at. She doesn’t need defending.

@haaretzcom It’s not a blow. The caveat they’re going to add will counter the missing examples. It’s an attempt to change nothing within the antisemitic arm of #LabourNEC while pandering to complaining #Jews. #LabourAntisemitism
@Mendelpol @RicardoBlack A redundant caveat given that none of the IHRA version impacts free speech. None of the examples stop you from criticizing Israel. But the caveat will allow them to JUSTIFY comparison with Nazis and fall back on freedom of speech instead of evidence. That’s the whole problem.

@BillDelGrosso @robsmithonline What does that even mean? This lazy attitude means you can always label people as victims regardless of whether they are or not. If they are, they’re victims. If they’re not, watch out, there is a drive for them to be victims again. Makes no sense.
@AyoCaesar The IHRA doesn’t suppress freedom of speech. You’re free to say any of it. It’s not a legally binding document. It’s a guideline for political parties to adhere to. There’s a clear difference that’s being ignore in favor of political goals.
@AndyMcDonaldMP @jeremycorbyn Underinvestment by government...don’t worry! Government will fix it!
@lyndseyfifield @SethAMandel Oh don’t worry, I agree completely that this is about Jews in this instance. However, I think it’s an example of an even wider problem that’s applied with regards to many different topics
@SethAMandel @lyndseyfifield I don’t think we should make this about Jews. It should be about the growing power and influence of faceless internet mobs who bully people in favor of an overall political goal. It’s happening every day, and it’s a huge and worrying problem.
@TheOfficerTatum @KamVTV Solid way of getting corporations to leave Florida in their droves, forcing unemployment to skyrocket, and thereby forcing more government dependence through social programs to combat unemployment. While raising taxes on actual people when corporation tax doesn’t bring in enough
@speaktodave @Peston @jeremycorbyn @OfficeGSBrown Solid bit of antisemitism there. Bravo.
@tufaylislam @haaretzcom Of what? UK Jews’ concern or that Corbyn is antisemitic? A) see literally any of the many Jewish groups, religious leaders, politicians, etc etc (or are they all fake?), and B) see how Corbyn criticizes Israel inconsistently while failing to criticize the actions of terrorists.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Checks and balances working beautifully there...a non-political Supreme Court Justice being labeled as a face of a so-called resistance against the sitting President. 🙄🙄🙄
@tufaylislam @haaretzcom Dismissing large portions of the UK Jewish population who are genuinely concerned about actual language and actions seems somewhat careless at best, and willingly blind at worst.

@hey_Texas @NRO @RyanGosling 2) for example, Scarlett Johansson was criticized by the Left as she was going to play the role of a transgender person. There is a growing movement for actors to march race/religion/sexuality/etc, which conservatives should reject.
@hey_Texas @NRO @RyanGosling 1) To clarify, I agree that omitting the flag is an attempt to edit history, and should be included as his was a significant American achievement. I was commenting on the fact that using a Canadian actor shouldn’t matter if we as conservatives are going to be consistent.
@MTB_ZRX @AussieYazz @johnsmi33126507 @jeremycorbyn He has certainly visited them a lot if he doesn’t like or support them...
@NRO Isn’t the current argument that actors can play anyone, because they’re actors? I don’t see why @RyanGosling being Canadian has anything to do with omitting the 🇺🇸, unless he was personally responsible.

@mahwashajaz_ Men aren’t disgusting. This man is disgusting. To combat disgusting men, we can’t label all men as disgusting. It makes it meaningless.
@jeremycorbyn It’s also shameful how the money was used in some cases, their links with Hamas, and the continual false definition of many as refugees for political reasons. Throwing money at a problem doesn’t help if that money is mis-used.
I wrote an article about this. Call something violence so violence is justified in return. https://t.co/TpZgwFpI4b https://t.co/IYH4kH3sFv
While members of @UKLabour quitting over #LabourAntisemitism is respectable and honorable, if #Corbyn doesn’t resign, it’ll just mean that the high-ranking positions will continue to be filled by his loyal followers (like @HackneyAbbott), making fighting #Antisemitism harder.
@EuanPhilipps @jeremycorbyn @DavePrentis @UKLabour It’s amazing how people judge the quality of a source by how much their view supports the narrative they want to push. Confirmation bias at its very worst.

@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan You know, this entire conversation you haven’t answered a single question. You’ve been either abusive “punk” or patronizing “son”, and used screenshots instead of using your words. Calling people fascists doesn’t make this statement not AS. I gave you a chance. I’m done listening
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan And we got here from criticism of Corbyn how...?
@haaretzcom “accused” isn’t the correct word. #Corbyn HAS done all of those things.
@Strangeland_Elf @michaeljknowles @JussajustJustin @realDailyWire For so long I have wondered why @benshapiro hates @michaeljknowles so much. Tonight, that question was answered.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan @ComradeVeidt, I’m completely lost regarding the flow of your argument, but I have to commend your blitzkrieg-like screenshot ability.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan Oh good! More screenshots! So you’ve found antisemitic quotes by Jews, therefore no-one else is antisemitic? So Corbyn isn’t antisemitic? I can’t work out if you’re a troll or serious, but the logic doesn’t make sense either way. How does this vindicate Corbyn...?
@IngrahamAngle @Rasmussen_Poll Really don’t think that “Trump Bump” is a good phrase to use.
@tebo_michael @dianeeldredge99 @realDonaldTrump By all means criticize, even hate him. But unmatched? Really though?
@annakatclarke @LaciWilliams10 While I’m a strong advocate for the #2a, and see the arguments in favor of campus carry (and agree with some of these arguments), I don’t think that phrasing rights arguments as “If you agree with A, then you must agree with B” is the way to persuade those who disagree.
@Liz_Wheeler In the age of #MeToo, it’s disgusting that the accusations (and therefore, the chance of justice for the thousands of victims) is jeopardized in favor of pushing a political narrative. It’s absolutely revolting.
@JSmithpolitics1 @Cernovich You might enjoy an article I wrote on this topic, making sure that we separate the leaders from the people who follow Catholicism’s true values:	https://t.co/gFVK9pThxB
@RealJamesWoods Probably only makes sense if she’s an expert on handouts, and so can criticize you for your supposed lack of knowledge? What a delightful paradox
@JSmithpolitics1 @Cernovich What is most upsetting is that any other factors are even discussed. Crimes of child abuse by those who are deemed leaders of morality shouldn’t need additional political context. The fact that anything else the Pope believes is discussed in the same sentence is despicable
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan Got it. Israelis are fascists/Nazis. Classic. Doesn’t really address your post talking about Rabbi Sacks leading a march, I.e. Whataboutism. But call Israelis Nazis if that’s what you enjoy. Screenshot articles are all the proof we need of blatant Nazism, “son”
@Cernovich @JSmithpolitics1 It’s the ultimate proof of narratives being more important than content. In the time of #MeToo, it seems it matters much more when it also fits a political narrative. The #Pope is more left-leaning, so criticism is diluted by linking it to conservative smears. It’s disgusting.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan What’s your point...?
@Heminator @bethanyshondark The attempt to in any way nullify credible accusations against the Vatican by labeling it as a conservative smear is spitting in the face of the #MeToo movement.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan Whataboutism is #corbyn fans’ only weapon. It’s ridiculous. #whataboutism
@willcollier @emzanotti This is just so gross. In the days of #MeToo, accusations of misconduct should be taken as separate entities, not assumed to be part of a greater political goal, regardless of whether that’s the case. Justice for the victims is what matters.

“Whataboutism” autocorrects on my phone to “What about Ian”. I knew Apple loved me.
RT @DLoesch: Nuance is dead and tribalists have zero interest in genuine conversation.
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan A 2 state solution is also impossible when Hamas calls for “from the river to the sea” and the annihilatiion of Israel and Jews. The silly thing is that I am saying that what matters is the safety of the civilians on both sides, and you’re justifying support of Hamas. Says a lot
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan You haven’t even read what I said! If corbyn was a pacifist, which he’s not, why does he condemn violence in one direction against civilians but condone it in another? Even if I thought both sides or neither sides were terrorists, that question is the important one.
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan If you cared to answer, I actually oppose the dropping of rockets on Palestinians. I like to advocate for the general value of life regardless of what side the civilians fall under. Corbyn vocally supports Hamas. How is that peaceful?
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan Pacifist who supports groups who, in their charter, call for the destruction of nations and the murder of Jews. What a peaceful chap. I have no problem with the fact he supports Palestinian groups. If he were truly a pacifist, he might mention rockets fired at civilians?
@Terrymc1939 @JewishChron Yes...I know...it was ironic...kind of supporting the joke so thanks!
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Also, to some extent; I agree with you that the arguments surrounding healthcare are diluted to overly simplex levels and miss the complexities of real systems, just to drive support or opposition. However, that works both ways, such as blind support for “single payer” in the US.
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan Example: Corbyn is vocally critical of the so-called terrorism of Israeli policies; yet very silent when it comes to the terrorist actions of Hamas and Hezbollah; groups he openly supports.
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein So many generalizations in one Tweet. If they reference the NHS, feel free to discuss with them. You’re also not the ambassador for all non-US people who apparently despise the American healthcare system...
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Again. I’m not going to try and speak for Autumn, she’s her own person with her own views. However, you called me a moron, and not her, so if you were actually angry at her, it’s a strange way of showing it...
@BernieSanders In all fairness, the level of helpfulness of a tax cut is directly proportional to the amount of tax you pay. Generally, the richer you are, the more tax you pay. So of course it would “help” the rich more...
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan Like Corbyn?
While I disagree with this comparison as people don’t hold the same moral value as weapons, it certainly highlights that both sides hold absolutist views when it comes to broad and complex issues, and these views might not be logical or consistent. https://t.co/t2AYaBpomC

@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein But when an #antifa member tells me I need socialized medicine, I know EXACTLY what he’s talking about, and it’s not your beloved NHS
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein But why are you so angry at me for using that phrase when, since Americans apparently feel this way and I am not an American, I might have a different or better understanding of the complexities of the issue? By all means be annoyed when people say it without understanding
Before this kind of headline is used to drive policy, let’s remember that number of convictions UNFORTUNATELY does not equal number of truthful accusations. When these numbers are closer, we can then draw conclusions safely. https://t.co/bV7OA5T4sU
@LittleHardman AND there’s one of the typos you warned me about.
@LittleHardman I feel like much better could be done. I don’t even know what Graniad means. Googling now...
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Also, very common Leftist tactic right there. I criticize something you like/use a phrase you don’t like, and you make that thing a basic moral principle: “basic human decency” and BAM I hate basic human decency. I reject that.
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein “Socialized medicine”? If you’re going to be annoyed at Americans as a whole for your presumed use of that phrase, maybe don’t call me a moron? Someone literally used that phrase when attacking me...
Probably not the most convincing defense...holding the economy hostage... https://t.co/0SE2XEhcmh
@autumnhopeklein I meant how did that come up? Just another lazy comparison?
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Thank God I wasn’t born on the 101, that would be most of my traffic-complaining time gone forever!
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Yes, I was successfully born in a NHS system. Therefore, socialized medicine is amazing. I’m not quite that arrogant...!
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Before accusing me of being a moron, the conversation I was referencing was DIRECTLY discussing socialized medicine. I don’t know why this triggered such outrage...and it’s also illogical to assume that being born in an NHS hospital means I can’t criticize socialized healthcare
Yeah, let’s ignore criminal behavior if they’re good at sport. Fantastic plan. https://t.co/Tbn5ssNgif

@LittleHardman 😂 while I’m certainly not a fan of the Daily Mail, it’s more the primary source video that I found notable. I haven’t heard “Daily Fail” before. Now my day will be spent thinking of other newspaper puns...so thanks for that 😂
@Ocasio2018 Some are attacking you because your arguments are based on inaccurate or immoral logic. I support Medicare for all and free college. I DON’T support the manner in which these things will be paid for. Asking people if they support healthcare for everyone, most people will say yes.
@EylonALevy What does he mean by more representative? I hate this short vague statements of “this should not be like this” without any thoughts on what it should be like or how that is to be achieved. “It shouldn’t rain today” ‘OMG he’s onto something!’ etc etc

@FreePali1948 You’re getting very aggressive while trying to ignore the truth about Hamas. What about the hundreds of videos of the crimes committed by Hamas, both against Israel but also their own people? This is more complex than “Israel bad, everyone else good”
@NormaFerrie @FreePali1948 And you’re refusing to see what I said. I’m not justifying the attrocities. Read the Hamas Charter. It’s not about human rights.

@JemimaJJ @BBCNews Point me to the line in the charters of #Hamas or #Hezbollah that mentions peace without the precondition of the destruction of Israel and expulsion or murder of Jews, and then I’ll take this seriously.

@KeiraJaneReed1 @OmanReagan @benshapiro @Ocasio2018 How so?

@flashimodo @TopTSlo @Partisangirl That’s completely false. There were injuries, 20 was the most recent number, with at least one serious injury
@Partisangirl My primary issue is the direct targeting of civilians, and when it is condemned when involving Palestinian children by #corbyn, and not when it involves Israeli children
@Partisangirl At no point am I defending Israel or their actions, or saying that the Palestinians don’t have a right to fight for their beliefs
@Partisangirl Yes, I can read, but that article does not cover the rather important part of international law regarding the protection of civilians
@Partisangirl My point is, and I really hope we can agree, is that we should care about the innocent civilians equally, regardless of which side they “belong” to
@Partisangirl You say firing rockets at enemy held territory is OK? So what about the children who happen to be under the rockets? Do they not matter?
@Partisangirl If you live with a worldview that violence against one set of civilians is justifiable but you also criticize violence against another set of civilians, it’s quite clear that peace can’t be achieved.

@jolly_angelina @MsJulieLenarz I don’t think anyone is arguing that #Corbyn isn’t principled. It’s his principles that are the issue! He’s hypocritical and inconsistent with his selective support or criticism of nations. That’s impossible to deny.
@arif3000 @MsJulieLenarz Ironically, @arif3000 , your profile calls for a one state solution and from the river to the sea. Given that this inevitably ends with the mass murder of Jews, I’m not sure you have much room to accuse Israel of fascistic polices.
@arif3000 @MsJulieLenarz Remind me of the part during the Holocaust where the Jews launched thousands of rockets at the Nazis? You can discuss Israel/Palestine objectively without resorting to accusing Jews or Israelis of being like the Nazis.
@MsJulieLenarz The longer this goes on, the more clear both #Corybn ‘s position is, and the level of acceptance for this within #Labour leadership. Truly worrying, and complete lack of context and objectivity doesn’t bode well for obtaining peace in Israel.
@tag_ash While it is awful that children suffer in conflict on both sides, the question should be asked as to why #Hamas spend money on weapons and ammunition and not shelters?

https://t.co/OOEU8Q56sv
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal But my point was that the assumption of responsibility is inherently a moral issue.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal Ok no problem. Let’s agree on what we are discussing. I thought we were talking about the view that those who disagree with abortion and want it outlawed are responsible for the lives that wouldn’t have existed if abortion had been allowed?
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal If you want a debate about abortion generally, then we can do that another time, this conversation was literally about the morality accusations
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal I want to bring us back to the original start of this conversation. I’m not interested in debating abortion. I AM interested in defending those who disagree with abortion from accusations of hypocrisy or immorality.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal But not for the people who think it’s murder. In the same way of serious animal rights activists who oppose animal slaughter for food, for example. In their eyes, it’s a crime.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal Please read what I said. I’m not saying abortion is murder. I’m saying IF someone thinks abortion is murder, then it’s reasonable to not want murder to occur and also not be responsible for the victim if the murder doesn’t occur
@glennmid10001 @kathykattenburg @m2mlegal This is again a common deflection. I’m not accusing anyone of murder. I’m saying that IF you believe abortion is murder, then it explains the viewpoint and responsibility opinions
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal I don’t understand. My earlier point, when I mentioned murder, was that you can disagree with what you view as a crime without any expectations of responsibility for the “saved” victim. I wasn’t arguing whether abortion is murder, just outlining a viewpoint based on that.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal So again, it comes to definitions of when life begins, and there are solid arguments for all sides
@glennmid10001 @kathykattenburg @m2mlegal So other countries making it legal doesn’t imply that it’s therefore correct. Some countries all over the world enforce inhumane laws. But that’s besides the point, this conversation is about accusing #ProLife people of being immoral

@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn 200 rockets, 20+ injured, some severely, damage to property and homes.
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn You’re trying desperately to deflect. @jimmy_wales comment was regarding Corbyns silence. Putting the Israel/Palestine debate aside, his silence shows implicit support for terrorist acts against Israeli citizens, while speaks out against acts against Palestinian civilians.
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn So violence against squatters is acceptable? Your abject justification of violence is pretty troubling.
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn #corbyn has a perfect right to speak out when Palestinian civilians are killed, but he can’t claim to care about crimes against humanity and then ignore crimes against humanity when the victims are Israelis/Jews
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn So you require Israelis to die before you care about rocket attacks? I don’t understand your logic. Corbyn is apparently a humanitarian, but doesn’t speak out when Israeli civilians are directly targeted. But it’s OK because none died?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I think there is a pretty solid argument for abortion being murder, it all comes down to when you determine life to begin. I do think that most people who are #ProLife believe to some extent at least that it’s murder. Anyone out there who is #prolife and disagrees, please do!
@PeteTheRed6579 @CarlAntoine @TopTSlo @Partisangirl And I assume you hold the same outrage towards #Hamas for targeting Israeli children? I show care for Palestinian children and all you see is a hateful person. This is the problem. Read my words and see your inconsistencies. We should care about all innocents.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Thank you. I hope it works, the world would be a much better place if those who disagree talked more ofteb
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I understand! I haven’t even blocked people who’ve accused me of being a “Zio”, so you’re perfectly safe. Beggars can’t be choosers, I don’t have enough followers to block people 😂
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn How so? Corbyn was silent. If you can point me to a recent quote condoning these recent attacks by #Hamas I will happily recant and apologize.
@igybundy @Partisangirl The pregnant woman and baby dying is clearly awful. However, the “young man” you mention was a member of the militant wing of #Hamas, so let’s not be blind to the truth that #Hamas are guilty of violence aimed at civilians too.
@jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn Thank you @jimmy_wales for posting this. It was objective and concise. The fact that people frame this as #Zionist shows how far we’ve come from a foundation of objective fact and contextual reasoning. This was about #Corbyn and his hypocrisy, nothing more.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal OK fair enough! I’m not going to block you, I’m genuinely interested in real discussions, and I’m not trying to win points or anything like that. As a conservative, I’m trying very hard to bridge the division between Left and Right, and try and bring respectful discourse back
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal But this falls apart if you approach abortion as murder, which is the general #ProLife position. You can think murder is wrong and make it illegal without being responsible for those who would be killed...
@CarlAntoine @TopTSlo @Partisangirl Instead of repeated memes, you could converse using words and address the issue of caring for both sides...
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal And I’m certainly not trying to change your mind. I’m just tired of #conservatives and #ProLife people being labeled as immoral or uncaring because of a reasonable viewpoint. It’s intellectually dishonest and divisive.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal That doesn’t mean that’s what I think. I’m just trying to disprove your overall argument regarding your original tweet - regarding only caring about babies under one year old
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal That’s the point. I’m arguing the case of those with whom you so strongly disagree
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal That’s not what I’m saying at all; you’re merely trying to deflect. Before I can respond, what am I requiring of others that I am not requiring of myself? Why would other people’s charity absolve me of responsibility? Please clarify so I can understand your argument
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Please stop saying “I” when referring to my views, I’m discussing policy not feelings. Your argument it seems is that if the government makes abortion illegal, the government is responsible for supporting all of the children who would have been aborted, correct?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I’m just making logical statements, removing emotion and personal feelings. What principles are you assuming are valid, and which aren’t?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Again, please don’t assume what my viewpoints are
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Ok I’m glad we can agree on that. But to be fair, you were the one to bring morality by accusing people of not caring about babies older than one year old...
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal If it’s not enough, then there’s nothing stopping you from campaigning for more charitable support. But there is a very distinct difference between charity and forced government support
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal If they choose to donate to charities, which many people do, then that is a personal choice
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal So where do you draw the line on what counts as adequate support? You are refusing to see my main point - it is reasonable for people to hold pro-life views and not be FORCED to be responsible for those lives
@CarlAntoine @TopTSlo @Partisangirl ...yes I agree...it’s awful when children are harmed, as they are innocent in conflict. However, context is important, #Hamas fire rockets from civilian areas, endangering their own people, and I believe we should care about all civilians, not just one side or the other
@igybundy @Partisangirl I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say. I believe that civilian endangerment and hurt on both sides is awful, but you can’t justify violence against one set of civilians while condoning violence against another set.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal To make an over exaggerated similee, I can not want someone to be evicted from their home, while also not seeing it as everyone’s responsibility to pay their rent. I can make personal choices through charity, but that’s a choice, not government forced.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal You are living with the assumption that the government, and therefore taxpayers, are responsible for people. If you are conservative, you tend to believe that responsibility falls upon individuals, both for themselves and for the lives they are responsible for
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Stop assuming moral superiority and truly read what I’m writing.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I agree it’s a question of logic, and you’re refusing to see my logical argument. Some would believe that a baby’s right to life means something regardless of what it has after birth, as a general principle. And again you’re accusing pro-lifers of not caring about babies
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal This is because Conservative beliefs are founded upon a principle of personal responsibility, and protection of rights to opportunity, not outcome. So pro-lifers believe in the baby’s right to opportunity, not outcome
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal My argument is to defend #Conservatives as a whole who are often accused of being immoral. It is possible to both want abortion to be illegal AND to be a moral person, AND not believe you should be responsible for the babies who are born as a result
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal People like @emzanotti hold reasonable pro-life views and also raise money to support the lives which exist as a result. Does that not count, in your eyes, as support?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Again you’re following the repeated and irrational assumption that anyone who disagrees with you is morally corrupt, and wants babies to be hungry, homeless, unloved, etc. My personal view of abortion has NO relevance on my point
@TopTSlo @Partisangirl Does that matter? Given there were dozens injured, some severely, and significant damage to homes and property, in guessing more than 0. What would be an acceptable number to land for you? How many people should be hurt for you to care? #Hamas #IsraelUnderAttack
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I’m commenting on the logical fallacy that’s used to attack pro-lifers by implying that if you are pro-life, you are a hypocrite if you don’t then want to support that life
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I’m not saying I do or don’t support
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal The original tweet was talking about pro-lifers only caring about babies until they’re born. My tweet suggested that you are allowed to care for the rights of an unborn life AND not be held responsible for that life...don’t really see how either of these tweets invoke govt.
@VanityByNatureX “No amount of compromise”...sounds like it’s straight from #Hamas’ playbook. Why is IHRA racist? How does it censor free speech? Literally no part of it stops you from criticizing Israel...
@Partisangirl Your version of #Zionism is pretty broad. Pointing out that #corybn, who is apparently a humanitarian, is silent when rockets are fired of civilians, isn’t a #Zionist statement...it’s pointing out his hypocrisy.

@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I think a bigger issue that is often ignored is that 1) caring about unborn life, and 2) not being personally responsible for that life, are not mutually exclusive. Believing something or someone has rights does not imply you have responsibility for it.
@alaskanlesbian 1) you’re permitted to disagree with abortion without having to be responsible for the child if you value personal responsibility 2) calling #ProLife people hypocrites and morons isn’t the best way of convincing people that your viewpoint is correct...#ProLife #ProChoice
Everything #KamalaHarris says is divisive. It’s fine to have your opinion, and it’s reasonable to discuss abortion as form of reproductive healthcare, but it is NOT right to dismiss reasonable arguments against with this level of arrogance. #ProLife #ProChoice #abortion https://t.co/eGeaVjTuJP

@oneforsorrow87 @localshmo @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn External control and withdrawal aren't mutually exclusive. Why do you think Israel blockades and controls who goes in and out?

Today, I was called a “Zio” for asking why people don’t care about innocent civilians, regardless of whether they’re Israeli or Palestinian... #Israel #Palestine #IsraelUnderAttack #zio #answerthequestion
@AsgharBukhari @haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn Accusing me, both incorrectly and disrespectfully, as a “Zio” doesn’t answer my question regarding inconsistencies of viewpoint. Do you care about civilians, or only if they’re not Israeli?
@oneforsorrow87 @haleez1234 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn @AbbyMartin Depending on the context, no. I think the IDF make quite a significant effort to save civilian lives. What I want is consistency. We should show care for the Palestinian civilians who are harmed. Therefore, we should also criticize #Hamas who launch rockets from civilian areas.
@haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn @AbbyMartin So, just to be clear, Hamas firing rockets at Israel civilians is OK because you see their government as the aggressors.
@haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn @AbbyMartin Again, do you define defending your home as firing rockets at civilians? You’re trying to cloud this very specific case with a larger debate. My issue is with citizens being directly targeted, and misrepresentation by mass media.
@ejectamenta_com @BBCWorld Israel withdrew completely from Gaza in 2005. Even if they were stealing land from Gaza, does that excuse random rocket fire on civilians in Israel?
@haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn 1) what happened before each of those dates? 2) even if you agree that they have a grievance, you’re saying that excuses random rocket fire into civilian areas? Seems inconsistent to me. You care about the civilians of one side, but not the other?
@ElishaKrauss I’m glad that news networks choose to follow the dating life of a dictator. Meanwhile nuclear disarmament hasn’t happened and his people continue to suffer. So let’s distract people from that! Really bad.
@philhirstgreen @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn Does that matter? Should Israel wait for someone to be killed before trying to fire at the people launching rockets? How many should die to warrant a response? Just curious where you draw the line.
@WePlainSpoken @JerusalemRescue @benshapiro @BBCWorld The Iron Dome protects from a lot of rockets, and Israel also has warning systems with sirens, phone notifications, and bomb shelters. Surprisingly, they’re used to this, and so invest to protect against it.
@BBCWorld Perhaps, instead of peddling misleading media, you could suggest what #israel should do when rockets rain down on their citizens? Any suggestions welcome. Just put yourself in the shoes of someone under those rockets, and then decide if you’d feel the same. #IsraelUnderAttack
@MuhammadSmiry @oneforsorrow87 Your very real suffering is undeniably dreadful. But, perhaps also ask your government #Hamas to stop attacking too...?
@oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn From Gaza? Does that excuse random rocket fire into Israel? I’m asking seriously, not to incite anger, what would you want your government to do if rockets were raining down on your families at 4am?
@Americistani @ShadysGirl12 @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld Ah so you can’t answer my question so you jump to the general and lazy accusation of Israel murdering civilians. Yes, it’s awful that innocent people get hurt on both sides. What’s more awful is that #Hamas puts their own people in danger willingly. #IsraelUnderAttack
@Americistani @ShadysGirl12 @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld What...?! Please tell me you’re not a troll. 1) Iron Dome - google it. 2) because #Hamas fire from areas highly populated with civilians such as schools and hospitals. How would you suggest stopping them?
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld You’re a wonderful representation of the total ignorance that fuels this entire debate. Israel is condemned for every response. If they fired back after the first rocket you’d believe the rockets were real? This is beyond ridiculous.
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld Is Newsweek believable enough? Perhaps you can point me to a better source, I’m afraid I didn’t go to High School. https://t.co/IHYMEPCUHf
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld Why should that mean it doesn’t happen all the time? Do you think it was all sunshine and rainbows before the strict control? Or maybe it was unimaginably worse...? You haven’t answered the question. Why do you doubt that the rockets are being fired?
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld https://t.co/qKJIhqnbRk
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld ...yes...because strictly controlled does not equal perfectly controlled...don’t really understand what you’re confused about honestly.
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld ...yes...because it happens all the time...with weapons provided by Iran...that’s why the ports and borders are so strictly controlled. #Hamas also use fire-bomb balloons if that’s suitably low-tech for you? #IsraelUnderAttack
@JerusalemRescue @benshapiro @BBCWorld The news doesn’t start until #Israel responds. It’s ridiculous. #IsraelUnderAttack
@Ostrov_A People need to ask themselves what they would do if it was their houses under the rockets. #IsraelUnderAttack #Israel
@georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn And why, exactly, are they under attack?
@benghand I think the true problem is that #Hamas understand and expect a response. Conflict is their key to continued power.
I truly believe that the #Palestinian people want peace. However, it is quite clear that #Hamas do not. #IsraelUnderAttack #Israel
Before criticizing #Israel for firing on rocket-launching targets in #Gaza by #Hamas, try and think of what you would do if the Hamas rockets were raining down on your homes?#IsraelUnderAttack #ceasefire
@Belal_Yaghi Easier to believe that peace is wanted by Hamas when Hamas stops firing rockets indiscriminately into Israel...?
Another misleading title pushing the anti-Israel narrative of aggression. Israel responded against Hamas targets after dozens of rockets were fired at Israel. It’s possible to report on this objectively. #BBC chooses not to. #IsraelUnderFire #hamas #Israel https://t.co/p2LVG61wUV

@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders Government involvement in the provision of medicine often leads to a reduction in quality with an overall increase in government costs...and since the government doesn’t pay for anything themselves, this falls on ever-increasing tax incomes. 2/2
@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders This idea that every other nation does necessarily translate. Population size and level of homogeny, tax rates, level of R&amp;D spending, medical needs, and quality of care are examples of such differences. I’m personally in favor of a system similar to Switzerland. 1/2
@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders I guess this comes down to your definition of “give”. In my mind, vast taxation for forced wealth distribution to pay for a frankly unaffordable range of services is immoral.
@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders And that’s the classic response. It’s not WHAT that is the question. It’s the often overlooked HOW that is immoral.
@TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders The new breed of more radical advocates like Bernie and Alexandria are pushing European socialism, which is, in my opinion, rooted in immorality.

@hansap @pyewacket1010 @ABC7 Naaaaaaaaah 😉😂
@hansap @pyewacket1010 @ABC7 What we need to do is form legislation that punishes crimes like this when committed outside of the US. It shouldn’t be the job of the Twittersphere to denounce them, it should be a legally enforceable matter

@jonesjillm @GhostPanther @SarahKSilverman And don’t assume I’m on the Trump train either. I’m just trying to advocate for a sensible, objective conversation rather than “all good” or “all bad”, which does nothing but fuel division in our politics.
@jonesjillm @GhostPanther @SarahKSilverman And this is just more absolutism. You’re missing my point. It’s a very difficult argument to make that the current administration has had no positive impact, including employment. If you’re not willing to concede that, then you’re very unlikely to change anyone’s mind.
@jonesjillm @GhostPanther @SarahKSilverman GDP &amp; Employment statistics, for example. It may shock many people that, like ANY political party, there are positives and negatives, and people are more likely to listen if you focus on both. Absolutism doesn’t tend to bring viewpoints together...it pushes apart.
Absolutist arguments are often ridiculous, particularly when it comes to hugely complex issues. In this case, see how many holes you can spot in this weak argument for completely open borders. #immigration https://t.co/yj2Py8Fuub via @usatoday

While rising rent house prices is obviously an issue, forcing the government into the loop will only make things worse. If people can afford a higher rent, prices will go up due to demand.

@Timewalkproject @alanmaddison20 But the issue here is Labour. I promise you that if Theresa May had similar accusations I would be just as vocal. Bringing up other areas such as sexism, while without a doubt important, are not what we are concerned about in this case. Ideally let’s fix everything!
Excellent article, focusing on the core of the issue that is still being ignored. #LabourAntisemitism #antisemitism #ihra https://t.co/SWwXySqOcv
@Timewalkproject @alanmaddison20 Disagree very strongly that the policies go further in terms of AS, given Corbyn’s personal affiliations. If you cut parts out, it can’t go further. However if those accused are dealt with faster, I will be more than supportive. I’m just not confident. I hope I’m proven wrong.

@Timewalkproject @alanmaddison20 This so-called test for antisemitic views doesn’t touch on the core issue: whether the leadership is anti-Semitic, and how we define antisemitism. Anti-semitism exists on both sides of the aisle, always has done. Leadership reaction to accusations of anti-sections is the issue.
@tommy_peto That’s why the examples listed are almost more important than the definition. You’re example is an excellent insight into casual racism. Most people who say racist things like that aren’t intentionally hateful or offensive. It’s an unintentional ignorance

@coincimental2 @jeremycorbyn Explain why “...because the Communists were never anti-Semitic” means that I think all on the left are communists. The political left contains AS PART of it communists. Communism has a pretty brutal anti-Semitic history. So the left is not free of anti-semitism.
@coincimental2 @jeremycorbyn How is it backtracking to repeat my words? I’m excited for your history lesson!
@coincimental2 @jeremycorbyn Not at all. Simply providing a counter example to your assertion that no-one on the left is anti-Semitic. Perhaps you need a lesson in logic? Fail to see how you concluded that some communists are anti-Semitic = the left is communist...?
