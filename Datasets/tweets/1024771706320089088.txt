your going to have to get some voulenteers to go down there and realign the magnetic poles
made by the people who make more war money
you can trace every transaction made by the banks
follow the money
https://t.co/eI1BS9ZduI
the poles have already collapsed
the galactic federation you should never have to rely on other people to do your own jobs and solve your own problems
some ones got to down into the earth to realign the poles
why would they not get thier own return investment ?
afterall they paid for it
how about the rest of earths population ?
when the poles collapse ?
do you have enough room in your secret deep underground military bunker for me ?
because some ones got to go down there and realign the magnetic poles
then i suggest you start working on the problem together
do you know what happens when the earths magnetic fields collapse ?
the galactic federation has been keeping them stable
on purpose
they keep moving the magnetic fields around
earth should get thier shit together help each other out and solve the problem
earth should not have to rely on other galaxys when earth is in big trouble
the galactic federation is keeping them stable for now
they can be moved around immediately
some ones going to have go down there and fix them
our polar fields have failed
then replace it
find the device first
