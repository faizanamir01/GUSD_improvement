@yashar @JussieSmollett When cops start getting indicted for doing the same, i.e. trumped up charges upon arrest that miraculously disappear by the first court date, is when we might, MIGHT, start to see some better justice.

@realDonaldTrump It's because it means nothing, really. When you're gone, soon, or 2020 at the latest, the stock market will still be there. Just like it's been since its inception. What really matters is healthcare, humanity, and democracy, i.e. following the Constitution. All these you suck at!

@realDonaldTrump Ok then mr. "I tell the truth when I can". especially when it's been documented over and over and over again, how you just make shit up as you go. But the good news is, Mueller's not done yet, and 2020 is close, so either way you're done, and soon. Thank God! 🙏🇺🇸 #ImpeachTheMF

@realDonaldTrump In some other number news...over 60% of us think/know you're a criminal pos that has destroyed...well, many things...and that is at BEST! God will take of the rest of your sorry ass
@realDonaldTrump Shouldn't you be golfing? Federal prison has your "tee time" reserved
@CBSNews Hey dumbass @realDonaldTrump I'll help your analysis of the #'s...this means that almost the same % of folks who think/KNOW you are a pathetic little man, think your wall idea sucks almost as badly as YOU!! So be proud, cuz, we are movin' up 🤙🇺🇸

@realDonaldTrump Ugh, Donnie...poor little man...always needing to deflect, to cover up your ineptitude. Most of us care about healthcare and other things, such as not fucking over allies. That is why I do not want a wall, our former allies may need to get over the border...to save us from you
Still feeling in command there, Commander @realDonaldTrump ? Nah, didn't think so. You should paraphrase the Mattis resignation letter and submit one as well...just a thought, but over 60% of "your people" would be forever grateful for the gift 🤙🎁

@JudgeJeanine No questions just a statement... @realDonaldTrump is going to find out that you're right, the law is hot on his trail, and he knows it...right ONLY about that, otherwise you disgust me
@GOP @senatemajldr Cute hashtag, #smallbusiness 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
@GOP @senatemajldr Gee...ya think?!?!?! Because @POTUS doesn't give aF about anything else but lining his pockets....and other oligarchy type a holes...i.e. waaaaaaaay too many CEO's of big business!!!
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Great idea @Alyssa_Milano but dude @realDonaldTrump doesn't know how to read...not with any basic comprehension at least

@realDonaldTrump Perhaps, most are far from it. very similar to the criminals living with you on PA Ave. most of the staff are simply providing for their families, progressing in a career, etc. You, and many around you, have abused your power. you said it yourself, we are a nation of laws, sooooo
@realDonaldTrump If they're like MOST of us, they don't want you to go. Comedian or not.
@AJENews Rest in Peace Fahmida Riaz 🙏🌠🙏
@Sweetangel009 Ugh 🙄
@glenn_wofford @NRA Stat spewing is not a solution...what would yours be then?
@glenn_wofford @NRA Oh...
@glenn_wofford @NRA Again...to simply make the point that I GET why we have it in our consitution to begin with...God help us all if that ever happened
@glenn_wofford @NRA You're right, I just think the thing that is truly scary to people in general, is that they're not safe seemingly anywhere, i.e. mass shootings. Again, I propose a START, focusing on mass shootings. seems a better alternative than simply stating stats. happy thanksgiving. am out
@glenn_wofford @NRA Ugh...I NEVER said they would...it is WHY it's in the constitution, the right to own...
@glenn_wofford @NRA Ok, thought I alluded, my bad...I would ban new sales of assault type rifles, period. Those should be in the hands of military and police...I will not buy the point that we have a right to arm against the gov't...I think we would get our butts kicked, even if everyone of had one
@glenn_wofford @NRA Hmmmm, not sure about your calculation because the issue I was referring to is simply mass shootings, not all homicides...not the same thing
@glenn_wofford @NRA However I think we need to at least try to make it much harder for people to obtain...it seems a start, but again, I cannot think of anything that will completely stop someone with bad intentions, even when legally obtained...thus the complexity we face
@glenn_wofford @NRA I suppose nothing new, i.e. your point perhaps. but I think it starts with auto weapons (those that are sold illegally, after market, illegal "enhancers" to make a semi-auto, auto, etc.)...I recognize that whatever is done will not STOP it entirely, nefarious will still happen...
@glenn_wofford @NRA Ok, fair enough...I happen to be fond of guns...I do not think confiscating is the answer, nor is it feasible, really...but it seems very possible to me that we can begin to move forward, not stand still
@realDonaldTrump Disgusting...you're probably, oops, likely, complicit in murder
@realDonaldTrump @mgoodwin_nypost Lol...the Post 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@NRA You folks should do the RIGHT thing!!! For once!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and offer a solution, a propsal, SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to try to stop having people slaughtered. NOT ALL mentally ill people kill. And not ALL mass MURDERERS/TERRORISTS are "mentally ill"...Wake the F up! ENOUGH!!!!!
@Barbara51864478 @JohnPurakal @Howy2012 RIP Dr. 🙏
@realDonaldTrump Yep, we will....just as soon as you get out of the seat
@ananavarro @lauferlaw Amen 🙏
@1future Happy birthday man🎂...we'll always have Venice 🤙😎
@realDonaldTrump @cindyhydesmith Apparently she doesn't love God though. how could she? if she supports you (hint, you straight up sound like the anti-Christ). says SUPER racists things, just like you, "prez". and prioritizes money and hate over love, respect, loyalty (see CIA, Arlington) then go @espyforsenate
@cindyhydesmith To answer your question, no, not with team Cindy...Cindy Brady, sure, but not a person who...oh never mind, you clearly, and sadly, wouldn't understand, sigh...🌊🙏 it's just getting started, that blue wave thingy 🤙🇺🇸
You are, what YOU are, mr. "president"...a complete disgrace to this country, the world, and humanity...your greed (among MANY other vile traits) is vividly on display...how much exactly, have they paid you? @realDonaldTrump Tick tock...it's Mueller's clock...
@Ocasio2018 RIP to your dad 🙏 he must've been quite a man...being that he helped raise a badass 🇺🇸
@ellievan65 Was waiting for this one...um, nope, pretty sure God LOVES CA 🏖🏜🏝🏔⛰...it's got it all, really does, and He might even be from there...or not 😎🙏❎
@Ocasio2018 When did you start to read @SarahPalinUSA ? Oh right, @katiecouric prompted that. Keep scaring the crap out of em, @Ocasio2018 🤙🙏🌊
@MSNBC @kodybears It really is not all that complex, it was murder by the prince. If you're @realDonaldTrump TRULY only concerned about our BEST interests (hint, NOT economy, duh!), then why would you choose twice (more?) to disagree/discredit OUR Intelligence Services? Tick tock, Mueller's clock
@CBSNews Yeah, figures...it's complex because you'll need the cash from YOUR take for Christmas probably...enjoy prison, oops, I mean happy holidays @SecPompeo
Fun, and meaningful 🤙🎶 https://t.co/FqhZB4XZAU
@whittenburg4SOS @susandtom You're "doing a fantastic job" of "commanding" there chief @realDonaldTrump
@Sweetangel009 That is great...the audio too, haha
@funder @RepMarciaFudge I hope not! How could you have POSSIBLY supported this behavior @RepMarciaFudge ? No words. Just smh...
@JerrellStrawn Ok then...is that enough for your comprehension?
@shahland Perhaps you're right...I can over-ruled 😁
@ReaganBattalion @DLoesch @JoeNBC Is he the sitting "president"? Didn't think so...wake up
@KellyannePolls "Ok then," said God..."I like blue. See the most recent election as evidence. Gotta claim 'oopsies' on 2016...smFh...oh right, happy Sunday."
@SenTomCotton @SenMikeLee @SenMikeLee challenged you @SenTomCotton to a debate...have the guts to take him up on it then
@SenTomCotton Maybe you can spend the night with you boss, hint, mr. "president", when he is taken away...see how that shit feels, being locked up
@thehill Then he should do it...even offer to...oh right, he's hiding a ton...something your smart husband has figured out...you can still switch teams, it's cool @KellyannePolls
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You folks @GOP are acting worse than his, @realDonaldTrump civilian followers...you can quit your jobs and likely find another...shame on all of you for not having the guts to make a stand
@Stop_Trump20 @UK_Unofficial Hahaha!! Not surprised that she's never been one of the brighter bulbs...smfh while lmFao all at the same time 🙄🤣
@LAProgressive @theintercept That last part though..."more bombs this yr...." 😥
@Acosta For the love of cliches...no concept of, "a day late and a dollar short"...ugh @realDonaldTrump ok...you get the last part, a $ short...sigh
@kurteichenwald Precisely...it's like the part about God created ALL his children in His likeness, is conveniently disregarded...and for seemingly nefarious gains
Since you like polls so much mr. "President" @realDonaldTrump ...didn't want you to have to go digging around, what with the "witch hunt" still going on and all, I assume you're busy soaking up some, I dunno, fox news maybe? I digress...happy to help, sir. https://t.co/fHtqDUMmzK
@Sweetangel009 Seems a valid point
@A_kamara6 Hell yeah man! Dance the night away 🕺...and keep ballin'🏈...Go @Saints...ok, until you play the @steelers in the @SuperBowl 😁✌❎
@kathygriffin I hope it's a Thanksgiving day table discussion...starting with, yep mr. "President", and____, and... 🙏
@A_kamara6 🤙🏈❎
@realDonaldTrump Lol...thanks for the Monday a.m. reminder/joke...,I JUST thought I was gonna tweet a nice note to you, saying today is as good a day as any to begin LEADING, for once, and bring us together...or try at least...but then, this. Stop blaming. Fool!
@grahamdavis @RachelFry26 Congratulations!
@exoticgamora Um...yeah, they missed, and badly...but hey, at least they tried...I think 🇺🇸🙏

I'm in!! 😊🤙🇺🇸 https://t.co/z1iLmdrzxp
@Jim_Jordan Thanks for laugh, you're funny...a cheerleader for nothingness, i.e. the "president" and fox, white boys club, news...don't let the blue wave wipe you out bro...but good luck with that though, because we're just getting started...it'll be a tsunami before you know wtf happened
@realDonaldTrump At least @AdamSchiff knows how to make stuff grow...you're worse than a pos...you're the WORST "president" from anywhere, not just USA. Ever. Tick. Tock.  It's Mueller's clock
@realDonaldTrump You're an idiot...maybe if you weren't stealing children, inciting violence, getting paid by a murderer in Saudi Arabia...I could go on and on...this type 9f shit would not have happened in the first place...btw, if you're still in CA, YOU go the fuck home
@thehill @VP Ugh...just when I was hoping we could kick out one of the worst excuses of a "president" ever, anywhere and through the history of time, you @VP pop in the feed, and I see more stupidity...not to mention hypocrisy...is it 2020 yet?!?! #TicktockMuellersclock
@thehill I hope they find them and then make them go swimming at the Farralon Islands...during sea lion season (lots of great whites around 🦈)...RIP Dolphin 🐬🙏
@thehill "Equality of opportunity"...says it precisely ✌🇺🇸
@thehill I am concerned about your mental health...delusions man @realDonaldTrump Get. Help. NOW. Oh right, never mind...you will forever be at the bottom of the bottom 10 "president's" of all time. In world history. Regardless of country. THAT is how terrible you are. Dumbass.

@funder Congrats @IvankaTrump you're now in the running for 3rd worst person in the administration...right behind your pops and McC...and JUST ahead of step-mommy
@DaddyDaddymac @cindyhydesmith you are disgusting...you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself...however, because you're a dumpster (the "president"...a little remedial help for ya), you will choose to ignore...I am guessing you consider yourself Christian...you may want to go back to class

@Maddierawrk @susandtom I am so sorry to hear this. May he RIP 🙏 fwiw, I have lost my sister, my best friend (in addition to me lifelong best friend, my sister), and a cousin to depression/suicide.

@realDonaldTrump That will happen when you @realDonaldTrump are moved out of PA Ave...Democracy and love, is FAR greater than your tyranny and hate

@tribelaw Big bummer, but you're right, he is a hero
@sharicedavids congratulations Sharice!!!
@kurteichenwald Good!!
@CNN You @seanhannity are worse than a piece of shit....that's right, shit turns into manure and helps stuff grow...you simply suck far worse...more like a small intestine...one that is congested, you know, constipated with nowhere to go but down
@thehill @EricTrump is not very bright either...money gets you into lots of schools...and yeah, @BarackObama is leaps and BOUNDS a better leader than @realDonaldTrump ...follow approval ratings much? Orrrrr disapproval ratings? Nah. Didn't think so...tick tock, Mueller's up...thank God🙏
RT @funder: Not having power cords for voting machines is voter suppression. Not having enough paper ballots is voter suppression. Retweet…

@KellyannePolls thank God for your husband, huh? I mean, phew! At least someone can think truthfully in your home...
@realDonaldTrump "Pop"...then, "swing and a miss", for you there Mr. "President" , as your timing is a bit off (it's a baseball reference, I doubt you played much, being the "athlete" you once were, thus do not understand the joke)...what is NOT a joke is tomorrow's news...the news when you lose
@realDonaldTrump Lol...right?!?! Even funnier from this side of the "fence" watching you lead the dumpsters...right where we want you...yep, into the trash bin of history...tick tock...tick. tock.
@MorganForMI THAT is a fabulous piece!! Thank you, and God bless you, for your service. Best of luck tomorrow! Go Blue! Nope, not a UM fan, but hey, I do dig the fight song 😁 soooooooo, Fight On! 😉✌ and Hail to the Victors!
@KMCRadio @MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley It's YOUR, in the context there tiger @KMCRadio...good reminder to never listen to your show...no credibility in something so very basic, our national language...buuuuuuuut, you will deflect and claim it was the fake auto correct
@KatyTurNBC That was good....and smart...go media 🙏

@BrianKempGA @realDonaldTrump Great...it'll be a very short lived celebration, thank God...and @BrianKempGA how desperate are you?!?!?! Oh right, you like orange lights...I prefer blue...and green, and red...you know CHRISTmas 🙏
@realDonaldTrump The criminal in this situation...is you...I cannot wait for confirmation from...oh, never mind, I love the sources A LOT more than your ass...you still suck, but worse now, after the past couple of weeks
@realDonaldTrump You're beyond inept and untruthful...you, and folks like you, created the cesspool that is the current white nationalist "movement"...it could only be "movement" if it weren't going to get absolutely drowned in a blue mother f'ing wave...dumpster
About sums it up...go blue https://t.co/bqX3156eMp
@BrianKempGA desperate much?!?!?! Sure hope you get your ass kicked Tuesday...easy tiger, not literally...nothing personal, just business...oh yeah, and politics
@BrianKempGA Newsflash...the leader of your party encourages, and overlooks, more violence by white nationalists than in history...yep, even THAT asshole from a few wars ago
@realDonaldTrump Careful when you call people whacko...dumpster....oops
@RudyGiuliani @RonDeSantisFL Can you even spell ineptitude? Oops, I just gave you a head start...or perhaps you still believe truth is not truth...genius 😶
@DannyTarkanian Sad that you cannot open your heart more, like your dad did with 2nd chances...many are simply trying to flee poverty...immigration policy needs to allow more people to come legally. news flash, Danny, it is PERFECTLY legal for a HUMAN BEING to show up at our door asking for help
@BillOReilly Ugh...you're in denial...like, oh never mind, wtf is the point? Stoopid is as stoopid does (sic...google that shit dumpsters)
@49ers Haha awesome 🤙
@TheEconomist I hope 🙏🙏🙏
@PaulDavisKS best of luck Nov 6!
@realDonaldTrump are you fucking kidding me?!?!?! How old are you? In the middle of a very inept tribute to the tragedy in Pittsburgh, you continue to incite...you are beyond pathetic...God help you, maybe...you suck
@ScottWalker You're not too bright, or apparently compassionate...sooooooo, good riddance after Nov 6...
@realDonaldTrump You're the most inciteful, lying, disgusting person to have ever resided on PAAve...Nov 6 is just around the corner so don't worry mr. "president" (can't WAIT for Mueller's report), voting will happen...you're not gonna like it though...happy halloween asshole...ok, not really
@CNN God bless these beautiful 189 souls...may their lights guide us through all the skies 🙏🌠
@HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @CNBC You dumbasses...like we care about the economy this week....or next..."nice work" finally standing up to the WORST potus, and a complicit administration, in dividing the country, if not the world...but hey, you assholes did it in record time, so be "proud" of that...smMFh!!!!
@staceyabrams @BarackObama @GeorgiaDemocrat @teamabrams Good luck Nov 6!
@IvankaTrump Who gives a fuck right now?!?!?!?! Humanity is at stake!!! After Nov 6, you can twit more about money....
@A_kamara6 RIP to your friend and brother, AK 🙏...and peace to you, and his/your family🙏...love you, man ❤
@Tony4WI Good luck Nov 6!
@Sweetangel009 Very sad
@realDonaldTrump You're extremely thought challenged because you have some bad luck when you try to think... that is obvious...to most of us anyway, thank God...yes, you LOST by 3 million votes...and that number is growing for 2020...twit, er tweet by tweet
@NBCNews Speechless...w.t.F?!?! Is all I got 😥😣
@brithume Um, in case you missed recent events @brithume (NOT to mention history gen...oh, never mind, you will deflect regardless apparently), &amp; have conveniently completely forgotten OkCity, he may in fact, be on to something..&amp; I'm white, not even CLOSE to having any guilt/fear of y'all
@marcorubio Have you conveniently forgotten what you said while capaigning Marco?!?!?! If you had any spine, you'd tweet that shit. Right. Now!
@TheEconomist Let's rev up the electric car making plants then...seems reasonable, and environmentally friendly as well...the pros can crunch #'s to figure out if it's cost effective..Container ships will still need oil so there's that...shipping goods to folks around the globe is a good thing
@DaveLapanDC Amen, and thank you for ALL that you have done for the USA, and humanity all over the world 🙏
@realDonaldTrump @RonDeSantisFL You're skilled in only one thing, making shit up, @realDonaldTrump ...as "president" (Mueller still investigating so, yeah, " 's!), you should be ashamed of yourself...I know, I know, you're incapable of that...God is disappointed beyond shame...I hope! 🙏 Go @AndrewGillum !!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe they're coming to pick up their fucking children
@marcorubio And you believe that the potus shouldn't be THE one with some of the most common sense to change rhetoric 1st? What other president has routinely attacked so many groups (the media, for starters), former potus', first ladies, and many others personally with things like "low iq"?!
@realDonaldTrump Wanna take some BP? I'll pitch
@realDonaldTrump @jaketapper Sure am glad God knows how to read...even if so many of your follwers apparently struggle with reading comprehension...regardless, have a blessed Sunday...is it Nov 6 yet???
@realDonaldTrump Are you fucking serious?!?! Oh right, you never look in the mirror below the comb over...but I digress...YOU are the "leader", so fucking lead!!! Or pretend to try, at the very least!!
@Grudi61 @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump your word, NOT mine..I respect the man, I voted for McCain
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump so now he is backpedaling, or is there a more accurate word?
@BillOReilly perhaps you, or trump, should not betray humanity first...even the USMC itself says, God, Country...
@BillOReilly how can YOU be certain of that?!?!?! Nobody can be!! Be careful sir, words can be dangerous...legally speaking, i.e. judges and stuff
@SenJohnMcCain RIP and thak you for all Mr. Galvin!
@SenJohnMcCain God bless you sir. And thank you, for so much that you have done for this country, and the world. May you and your family find healing and peace.
@realDonaldTrump stfu already and get to work!!!
@realDonaldTrump Instead of playing golf this weekend, get to church and pray like never before....you need to at least TRY to be dignified! MT did NOT die for political gain!!! You suck so far as "president"...us real business people will have ZERO problem kicking ass w/o you
@newtgingrich you sir, should your ass to church this weekend. In fact, do NOTHING else...MT DID NOT PASS FOR POLITICAL GAIN asshole!
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends do you even know how to spell inept? or moron for that matter? google it, since, you know, your bookcase is empty as fuck
@realDonaldTrump oye, senor "presidente", hay mucha gente dentro su pais quienes no te gustan. y no son todos Democrats, son gente con cebreros mejor que tiene usted! Disfruta cuando el departmento de justicia estan terminado con su investigacion por MI pais, USA!!!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump can you even spell ineptitude? ugh, how about an easier word for you Donny, moron...google it if you're not sure the meaning...have a kindergarten kinda day
concerned about our "leadership"...to be continued...
@realDonaldTrump you, especially you, cannot be trusted(x) with millions...it would go straight to the Kremlin...and then what, Donald?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends folks love a comedy...and you're the star
@FoxNews @PeteHegseth @VP and an administration with no heart, is not a country being led properly...if at ALL!!
