@foxandfriends @JonathanTurley Dollars to donuts https://t.co/HVrYmvrMzP FIZZLES SPUTTERS &amp; FLOPS IN HER ASS cause she knows she's " full of it"!!!
@ChuckCallesto Obama is losing his mojo cause he knows his past political monkey business is catching up to him. Watch him get skinnier &amp; grayer cause all sorts of things are about to bite him in the ass...
@RedNationRising The conservative rebellion will be in the form of winning nationwide political elections. The leftists think they have reached critical mass ? Stand by for a reality check !!!
@RedNationRising Sooner or later the down to earth honest law abiding hard working Patriotic American Citizens are going to have their own revolution in rebellion to the outrageous radical extremism of the leftist democrat socialist that have become constitutional enemies !
@DFBHarvard @donaldrusso994 As a psychology professor https://t.co/TXvTVUnbxB is a study on the dark side of reality. She can't remember details of what, when or where the single most " memorable ???" event in her life??? LIER LIER LIER !!!
@HotShot_78 @GeorgiasLori @POTUS Pres. Bush Sr. &amp; Jr. along with Bubba Clinton were skull &amp; bones cultists. No wonder The COME back kid gets along. Why wasn't HRC accepted by " skull &amp; bones"? She just COLLUDED with Barry Hussein Sotoro &amp; Yalees don't care for Harvard weenies...
@LouDobbs https://t.co/TXvTVUnbxB should be asked if she had more than one abortion before she was married &amp; were the baby parts sold to scientists.
@LouDobbs The whole Ford thing is an Edsel except it is a stinking blend of USSR &amp; 3rd Reich hatchet job routines ignoring the precedents of civilized law. Automatic guilt with absolutely no evidence other than innuendo from an underage drunk &amp; she was on wild side!
@DineshDSouza Democrat cohorts are used to getting away with Keith Ellison double standard hypocritical tactics.
@covfefecocktail @sewwutnow @HyltonRobin Many of "Dr." Fords friends seem to be not so many &amp; are probably cringing in the shadows of unreality. History will not be kind to her less than flakey contrivance to help the radical democrat socialists power play.
@kissmyasstroll If it comes down to "survival of the fittest" radical democrat socialists are screwed. Way out muscled &amp; with better gear - down to earth conservative folks will prevail over flakey assholes.
@Italians4Trump Did all that Tequila make her clothes fall off? How many times? How many guys? Did any ever end up on the Duke LaCross team?
@Italians4Trump Of course you can trust a former 15 yr old underage drunken teenager memory who can't remember exactly when &amp; where she was 34 years ago. Sooo many potties with so much underage drinking - long way from foggy bottom
@EmerickTrent1 @adriandt31 @ConcernedHigh Barry Hussein Sotoro loves Saul Alinsky " Rules for Radicals" template, methods &amp; madness...🙋🏾‍♂️😈👹👺
@journo_star @mike_pence Journoman your anvil logo is unsecured &amp; represents your phoniness - your " non prayer" is in effect your own prayer which has no value...
@journo_star Rosenstein is proven to be a complicit hair ball in the farcical DOJ excretions fouling due process of law. Our enemies are laughing at us &amp; cheering the democrat foul plays...
@dbongino Thank God &amp; our founding fathers for our total bill of rights which radical leftist democrat socialists are attempting to over throw!
@dbongino The so called " resistance movement " is using both classic fascist &amp; communist political psychology, methods &amp; tactics. This is right out of various historical manifestos of both movements.
@mdj17 @BreitbartNews The democrat opponents of standing Supreme Court considerations &amp; procedures are using unsubstantiated three decade faulty memory statements to override  the rule of law resulting in their painting themselves as the definition of fascists !!!
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Face it the whole democrat escapade over the Supreme Court nominee is about so called "rights" for abortions. The " resistance" sedition will not approve of any Pres.Trump Supreme Court nominee therefore they should be " bypassed"
@watspn1013 It's so ironic that Neo zealot Corey Booker has been caught up in his own hypocrisy by some of his previous narcissistic blathering. History is not convenient in so many ways for the Neo P C democrat socialist wanna bee totalitarian "elites"
@MrsMThatcher @GillesnFio Karl Marx never had a job, never held political office. he never earned a wage or ran a company. Marx was a political grifter who conjured up unworkable totalitarian theories for so called " elite" power mongers.
@foxnewspolitics @AdamShawNY Patriotic American Citizens like Judge Kavanaugh can see through the unConstitutional democrat assaults on the US Constitution. Thank God Pres.Trump will be able to appoint Judges who believe in the founding fathers original intent - anti tyranny!!!
@cjdtwit @adriandt31 Mueller &amp; cohorts are proving to be unConstitutional totalitarian power monger wanna bees selling out the duly elected Pres.Trump administration. They were promised fat jobs to back up the Neo Democrat socialist totalitarian minded elites.
@ChuckCallesto Harvard is proving to have been taken over by radical 60s-70s type seditious can't call them " educators " No respect or allegiance to the US Constitution. Harvard faculty are famous for being leftist liberal socialists...
@Kilgore_Trout2 @jeromegravesbm1 @BreitbartNews Feinstein's main concern is avoidance &amp; denial of her years of doing business with the Chinese government - Anything to divert attention away from her families seditition...
@jaketapper Bite me Biden just loves to rub &amp; pat those cute little fannies for the camera 🎥
@jeromegravesbm1 Please don't JUDGE or say anything about HRC terrorizing her husbands conquests...how many were/are there? -hard to keep count but have a feeling age has slowed them down
@BernieSanders Democrats in their sanctuary cities believe in &amp; sanction affordable tent cities with portapotties. Uncle Bernie refuses to visit these " sanctuaries " unless he is provided with bio-hazard suits with respirators. Halloween could be a good time Bernie!
@thehill Snoop Dog is as good as used dog food left on San Francisco sidewalks 💩
@t2gunner Planned Parenthood sells viable baby body parts to scientists for their experiments in the name of scientific progress ! None of them believe in the Old or New Testiment. In effect they parallel satanic cults...
@RedNationRising Enemies of the US Constitution should be stripped of American citizenship &amp; deported to a socialist country !!!
@JudicialWatch Ms.WIGGY is a domestic enemy of the US Constitution &amp; should be stripped from public office ! IMPEACH Ms.WIGGY - IMPEACH MAXINE !!!
@ChuckCallesto Kamala Hairass doesn't know what the 6th amendment is or says. She &amp; Ford want to violate Judge Kavanaugh's Constitutional rights because they are domestic enemies of the US Constitution &amp; should be stripped of citizenship &amp; deported to a socialist country!
@SeasideSue1 Ford is a last minute democrat Trump hater shill with no witnesses what so ever &amp; a dementia type false memory that can't remember shit !
@SeasideSue1 FYI Kavanaugh's mother foreclosed on Ford's deadbeat parents &amp; Ford is perpetrating a payback F U scam &amp; trying to violate his 6th amendment rights with a dementia type improv.Low I Q people don't know there was no Fed.crime for FBI investigation.
@CB618444 Being a psychology prof. https://t.co/KoyttmbYkL must know about false memory syndrome &amp; adolescent brain farts. She seems to have a concocted  memory brain fart with many little " accidents "!
@JackPosobiec @Lisa6896 Radical leftist democrat socialists are in bed with a gaggle of Russians &amp; Chinese &amp; per Saul Alinsky " Rules for Radicals" TRY to pin their donkey tails on elephants. It just doesn't work with their 19th century Marxist template.
@WayneDupreeShow Feinstein wansts to continue violating the 6th amendment - unconstitutional witch!
@ChuckCallesto Just give " Bite Me" time to cook his own goose. He's becoming more &amp; more neurotic !
@CNN Ford is just a democrat monkey wrencher  pissed about her dead beat parents being Judge by Kavanaugh's mother. Investigate her deadbeat socialist parents...she would have said something to them - whole thing is kinky like her...
@MegynTODAY @megynkelly Three is no history of Judge Kavanaugh having done anything other than being an honest straight shooter - unlike typical kinky democrat BLTs
@SinoGuy @mdj17 @WhiteHouse Pay back is a Mother? Ford is caught with her pants down &amp; she pulled them down all by herself. Her husband must know how treacherous she can be - border line man hater - sorry for him !
@KellyannePolls The majority of Patriotic American Citizens are disgusted with the radical democrat socialist agenda &amp; the current monkey shines of hokey pokey. There is a classic struggle against democrat jihad &amp; conservative American Citizens.
@AmericanThinker The London mayor won't allow British citizens to protect themselves from knife wielding Islamist butchers. Anyone caught physically fighting in self defense is arrested &amp; brought to " dock"...
@ARmastrangelo Ms. Cortez is one of the new Republican helpers with her lame brain 19th century socialist mindset. Karl Marx never had a job, never owned property, never ran a company, was never a money earning worker &amp; unlike Cortez he never held public office...
@davidwebbshow Seems like Lisa Page is Strzok's Stormey - She has a future working in the " industry " if she hooks up with the pimp attorney but Strzok could take over by bumping off the competition.
@ChuckCallesto RINO Flake is seen for what he is - beyond his limited miscreant power he is a 🐍
@JudicialWatch B Hussein Obama &amp; Soros ( Spectre ) have sold their souls - 40 years (2score) from now it will be part of our history &amp; many will have past on to our just deserts only some won't be so sweet ! BLOOD MONEY ON THEIR HANDS !!!
@rial_rocks @DianeFeinstein The Feinsteins are in bed with the Chinese Government - there IS NO ARGUMENT it is well documented! Why is she allowed to be on any type intelligence committee? Hopefully there will be a major " roll up " foreign enemy &amp; TRAITOR prosecution !
@GeorgiasLori The truth will out about Barry Hussein Sotoro , "foreign student "scams &amp; other film flam student drug dealing capers...
@AmericanThinker Ginsburg's last gasp hope is finding a taxidermist coordinating with state of the art artificial intelligence robotics to bring her up to speed in a Hollywood sci. Fi. or T V https://t.co/rODrR3ZmdH. role ...
@foxandfriends Holder &amp; Biden sold their souls to the devil years ago with their under the table, back door money making insider deals.
@SenSchumer If there is no federal crime the FBI has no jurisdiction !!! Shoemore can suck eggs &amp; pound sand !!!
@FoxBusiness What did we ever do before GOOGOIL &amp; AMY'S SON ? 😜 We can all do without personal info. trawlers ? Go retro!
@JudicialWatch All the monkey wrenching leads to the 👑🙋🏾‍♂️man.
@RedNationRising He &amp; we would cross that bridge when he came to it ? Oh yes Mary Jo !!!
@jtd_gameon12 @jeromegravesbm1 Swift Boat Kerry's family is married into the current Iranian leadership but they won't last too much longer. The majority of the people hate the totalitarian mind set because they are educated more civilized than many other Muslims...
@DrMartyFox The U.S.Constitution anticipates enemies &amp; those who swear an oath to protect it ( millions) will use the 2nd A discretely &amp; efficiently!!!
@kadaster_mehmet @jihadwatchRS The Chinese have the " final solution" for radical Islamists. If you want to get a head there as a Muslim they will hand you yours. The world doesn't hear anything about Chinese vs. Islamists in Africa cause journalists are scared shitless.
@kadaster_mehmet @jihadwatchRS OH! Now I understand but in this area anybody who goes after Christians is going to be an experiment in our 🌵 desert !!!
@CNN Islam is such a peaceful nightmare - everyone is an equal opportunity homicide victim/perp. Let the " elite"  radical leftist liberal democrat socialists show them how to live &amp; think cause they have all the answers. ( but no success !!!)
@NavyTimes Where are the EMP weapons when we need them? Drop them like flies!
@realDailyWire Google has become a gaggle of money grubbing ghouls. Many things have been written about the controllers of technology becoming domineering elitist totalitarian control freaks - Here they are !😱😈
@jihadwatchRS The Europeans are waking up to a radical Islam night mare. The camels are on a rampage - where is animal control? Ship them back to their shit hole countries. Blood thirsty creatures want infidels on their plate. We will give them a 2nd amendment chance !
@CB618444 Democrat violent outrage advocated by the likes of Maxine Waters is escalating into a democrat initiated war. Now murder is on their table!
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton Strzok has the look of a maniac &amp; it became contagious !
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Democrats love to monkey around numbers and lists of voters living &amp; dead. The walking dead come in handy but maybe now they need martyrs?
@RedNationRising Bidens, Kerry, McCain &amp; cohorts are/were " as thick as thieves" ! How do carrier politicians make $millions with their side jobs?
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller @GeorgePapa19 The Strzok maniac fits the FBI profile of a maniac &amp; monkey see monkey do in a toxic environment. It made them all sick - call it a work place hazard?
@Patrici15767099 @larryelder @perriganps @realDonaldTrump Is looking around doing research, asking questions @ facts &amp; opinions &amp; sometimes changing your mind from a previous decision - is that being erratic compared to gummed up shoe goo socialist mentality ?
@thehill Kerry's daughter is married into the Iranian regime &amp; there is lots of money to be made but what about his Jewish heritage ?
@RealSaavedra @FaithandFootbal CNN will always stand up for their shams scams shuck &amp; jive it's who they are but that's OK cause most people are smarter than they don't give credit for &amp; perpetuate their own worst enemy syndrome 🤣
@CB618444 @Ocasio2018 Ocasio Cortez also has quite the man spread with her ostentatious outfit. Hypocrites just can't help giving themselves away with their over confident arrogance...🤣
@V_actually @FaithandFootbal Eunuchs are white people too...

@ord3001 It's a different world for " kids" who grew up reciting the Lord's  Prayer &amp; the Pledge of Allegiance with our hands over our hearts ! American History &amp; Civics ? What's that ?
@kencampbell66 @DailyCaller Podesta brothers have both Russian &amp; Chinese business connections. Where is the FBI &amp; CIA &amp; DHS on this topic?
@GeorgiasLori John Kerry &amp; wife are tied by marriage to Iranian leaders. Is their daughter with Jewish roots going to convert ? Why doesn't the leftist liberal socialist press cover this interesting chain of events ?
@RedNationRising Booker doesn't even look like Kirk Douglas - what the heck ? Booker is a racist to think Spartacus was an African 🤷🏾‍♂️
@seanhannity Feinstein in her official capacity violated Judge Kavanaugh's 6th amendment rights ! Impeach Dianne Feinstein!!!
@watspn1013 Feinstein is becoming a prolific Mandarin speaker for a reason...all sorts of retirement perks...
@StandingDarrell @GeorgiasLori Is that a bumble stumble head banger face plant ?
@DailyCaller Hillary made a big mistake carrying &amp; going to "term" ?!
@NCEmergency @SenThomTillis 70% of the Puerto Rican grid was down BEFORE the hurricane &amp; the democrat cleagle friends &amp; family in the wealthiest communities were taken care of before the little people. Hospitals were 3rd world before &amp; after - full of rodents &amp; cockroaches.
@Mike_Beacham Obama is following classic Saul Alinsky play books maneuvers. Rules for Radicals was dedicated to Lucifer - BHO &amp; HRC are devotees...read the book!
@SheriffClarke @Mike_Beacham Republicans need to set up game cameras to catch the rats while the cats are gone !
@CM6142 @ROHLL5 @MareForAmerica @1776HotLips @realTRUMPERLAND @GemMar333 @lah3309 @poconomtn @Goz_1911 @dr_dot @KatTheHammer1 Of course she was tied in - very theatrical !
@ConservativePTZ @RyanAFournier Next step is to water the lawn &amp; wash the windows?
@thehill The porn perp. lawyer is an evil clown capable of untold treachery with anything he touches. His client is now the queen of the purulent sex trade &amp; he is obviously her pimp. The democrats love associating with this type of slime.
@ChrisPlanteShow @SCPOUSNRET The Puerto Rican democrat leaders  are &amp; have been some of the most corrupt people in U.S.Territory They were perps. for years before they became grifters. They prove how inept socialists are at managing anything in an above board manner.

@JudicialWatch IMPEACH MAXINE FOR SEDITIOUS ACTS OF EVIL - SHE IS LIVING PROOF OF NEO WITCH CRAFT but she's a flop with her black magic cause the gob won't let go of her
@hirschA8720 @PJS18463750 How many Chinese Nationals are FBI agents? NONE? Dianne was a direct conduit to the Chicoms for how many years thru her " handy man"? She has become the " bride of Frankenstein "!!!
@MrNashington @AmandaLeeHouse Reality is often stranger than fiction &amp; many theoretically intelligent people prefer &amp; gravitate to the reality of fiction. Thus many are in reality very cuckoo  capable of great weirdness to facilitate the merging of their fantasies with reality...
@MattBracken48 All Christians &amp; Jews better prepare themselves for the advertised &amp; escalating radical Islamist jihad ! They really have declared war against us &amp; they have wide spread media support. Concern over their declaration of war is not paranoia !!!
@MattBracken48 Many Europeans are coming to their senses over the " Islamist refugee/migrant" invasion. All Islamist leaders have declared a " take over" of the western civilization of " infidels "Stand by for extreme violence on a world wide scale !
@STEPHMHAMILL @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends @FoxNews @DailyCaller @LisaMarieBoothe @PeteHegseth Seems like the Russians are partially responsible for the leftist democrat socialist politicians &amp; cohort media to develop a chronic &amp; acute mania type neurosis &amp; separation from reality at a critical mass. The Russian diversion scare is their monster!
@GeorgiasLori @tedcruz Why did Obama have the Muslim Brotherhood visit the White House multiple times while Oomah's mother was an editor of the Muslim Brotherhood rag? Mama &amp; Hillary connection? etc. etc. !!!
@ABC @BretBaier The war games give China an indication of how they could overwhelm their not total friend &amp; it give us a chance to see their weaknesses 👨🏻‍💻👀😎
@InGodIDoTrust @jeromegravesbm1 @realDonaldTrump Quack quack
@CorpsmanRetired Quack quack...
@foxandfriends The aggregate of Google people's clear expression of anti-Trump opinions is prima fascia evidence of a gaggle of prejudice...🦆quack quack now they duck the truth.
@CorpsmanRetired If Suckerbird censors hate speech no democrats would be on HIS forum. Radical leftist democrat socialists not only advertise their intentions on F U Book but act out with physical violence after being bolstered by FB &amp; Twitter.
@RedNationRising It would be wonderful if Cory Booker gets the 2020 democrat nomination. It would guarantee another 4years &amp; Booker could move to South Africa 🇿🇦 &amp; become a big hero...
@allahpundit @DanaPerino Cancel Kerry's Pass Port &amp; security clearances. Kerry is admittedly monkey wrenching at Obama's bidding !
@PoliticalShort @seanmdav Do you mean jackals like Brennan,Crapper, Comey,Strzok,Page  &amp; rest of the pack would hamstring their prey before taking them down ?
@JohnTiegen Maybe Montel's MS is affecting his judgement ?
@HLAurora63 @ord3001 Maybe people on a conservative grass roots level will learn how to take care of the vermin explosion with improvised rat traps ?
@ord3001 Critical mass is here ! The deplorables are dealing with barrels full of 🐍🐍🐍 &amp; their poison has empowered creatures like MS13 animals &amp; Antifa excrement generators with PR provided by Neo journalists.
@RealMAGASteve @prissy4001 The whole crew were &amp; are  like mafioso &amp; were used to having blood on their hands but it is now engrained in their souls. All those in support will eventually figure out what happens in the after life. Dancing with the devil is never good !
@JudicialWatch The Senate doesn't need to have a nose booger like Corey Booker. Pick the booger out of our noses.
@realClintonM614 Leftist liberal democrat socialists should all go to the N C outer banks &amp; start screaming their lungs out to fight the hurricane if they fail Mother Nature can take care of them &amp; they can recycle into the carbon chain &amp; feed sea critters.Go Green!
@JedediahBila All except Chelsea Clinton !
@JedediahBila Pregnant women should at least be allowed to wear shoes outside the house...👠👢👡👞😜
@brithume If Hillary had abortions it's probably a good thing. Now it's Chelsea's turn to limit the Clinton gene pool.
@conservmia @CB618444 @MSN Dirtier shit comes out of Scarborough's pie hole than out of his rear end spit hole.
@FoxNews Why do radical leftist NM democrat socialist people want to release the Islamist Terrorist child molesters ? Democrats are the only ones wanting to sanction human trafficking with child molesters &amp; Muslims advocating political violence !!!
@tgradous @worldnetdaily Do you mean MUELLER is a JACK OFF?
@ReconMarine55 The LOONEY RADICAL LEFTIST JOURNALISTS ARE NOW BACKING VIOLENCE &amp; ASSASSINATION OF PRES. TRUMP - THEY SHOULD BE JAILED FOR SEDITION &amp; DEATH THREATS !!!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Carol Cooks partner actually advocated killing Pres.Trump with her blessing. What a call to arms for conservative defense from wacko calls for assassination &amp; Brennan calls for blood in the streets .BEWARE OF THE DOGS OF DEMOCRAT WAR 👹👺
@thehill If the NFL sponsors are smart they will walk away from poor performance art ...
@thehill Kneeling NFL birds are doing harm to themselves. They don't hurt me or anybody that ignores them by not watching their antics. Just don't watch their poor theater performance art ! They aren't real Patriots any way - DOMESTIC ENEMIES !!!
@MikeTokes @watspn1013 @PetersCongress Now the radical leftist democrats are taking up Maxine's call for violence. Knife attacks call for deadly force defense. All conservative Patriotic American Citizens should prepare themselves for the democrat declaration of war !
@paulsperry_ @steph93065 Why did Obama let so many GITMO terrorist prisoners go? They went back to killing more U S Military. Watch the " Death of a Nation ( D'Nesh Desouza)
@thehill BHO knew all about Russian snooping/hacking monkey business &amp; figured Hillary was a shoe in so he did nothing but being flexible he shared with Comrade Vladimir. Obama &amp; Hillary got snookered with their " reset button" bull by a better Russian chess player!
@DailyCaller At this point in time ?The teflon is wearing thin &amp; flaking off with advanced age &amp; too much heat...the Clintons are almost cooked !
@fletchefwl @Kodak621 @HLAurora63 Obama was talking to Vladimir Lenins spirit when he became more " flexible" with Lenin's name sake. Don't call it collusion how about connections. Obama is pissed because he got snookered by a better chess player !!!
@JudicialWatch Next time we will have to remember the openly fluid  borders the leftist democrat socialists want for additional useful idiots. The domestic &amp; foreign enemies have been joining ranks for quite awhile with all sorts of sanctions. Critical mass is here!
@JudicialWatch It's sad the era of the democrat "walking dead" maybe coming to a halt. It was hard for them to have photo I Ds. How many other states beside Illinois still have walking dead democrat voters?
@davidharsanyi @seanmdav It will be entertaining to see the democrat fantasy bubble burst...
@Redtowel4 @ZibaLady1 Strzok &amp; Page were just applying for an insurance policy together naming Hillary as beneficiary. Job security &amp; advancement was of primary importance...

@JohnTiegen Just practicing to keep proficient &amp; pursuit of happiness by happy warriors. What will the future present ?
@cnni Jack Ma can think circles around Obama in most things especially when it comes to business &amp; the economy. Obama is depending on an OLD COMMUNIST PARADIGM THAT DID NOT WORK &amp; DOES NOT WORK. Too bad Barry Sotoro !
@realDailyWire Obama divided  the nation like no other President in the history of the U.S.A. &amp; had one failure after another including the actions of Hillary Clinton...
@thehill It was known Omarosa was very jealous of FLOTUS from her T V days !
@JudicialWatch Obama,Hillary Clinton, the DNC &amp; heads of the intelligence agencies were &amp; are trying to pull off a coupe overturning Pres.Trump &amp; in effect are perpetrators of sedition !!!
@cnni Obama's mother met his father who had other families in Kenya while he &amp; she were studying Russian subjects together in Hawaii. Obamas father &amp; grand father were communists ! " The apple does not fall far from the tree." !!!
@cnni Obama never saw or called Russia an  enemy.He ignored all the warnings stating the Cold War was/is over. Obama was told about Russian interference by the FBI &amp; did nothing. Obama is in effect a double agent !
@DrMartyFox Obama is becoming more &amp; more a public zealot trying to monkey wrench Pres.Trump. Obama &amp; crew have no respect for the 60 million American Citizens who voted for Pres.Trump. Obama is proving more &amp; more as a domestic enemy!
@BreitbartNews Hillary's math does not include correct basic arithmetic with the Clinton Foundation Russian " donations" for " Uranium One &amp; Speeches in Moscow...
@adriandt31 @TombStoneBub @POTUS Looking at Maxine's James Brown wig it has the same exact configuration day after day time after time 🤣
@cajunchick25 @GeorgiasLori @DailyCaller The Maxine Waters twitter phenomenon is prime example of a double standard for radical leftist liberal democrat socialists spewing vile hatred &amp; promoting violence. Time will tell how it all shakes out &amp; who has an ethical conscience.

@ToddWeston7 @KayaJones When dealing with a girl like this hang on to your wallet unless the little head goes out the window. Then you deserve to lose &amp; receive a lifetime gift...
@We_R_TheMedia @CB618444 Muslims react to radical democrat leftists claim that all Cops  are pigs &amp; advocate violence against ICE &amp; US Border Patrol Officers. As a result radical Islamists are calling for all out slaughter with knives if guns aren't available. WAR !
@ChuckCallesto WOW WEE Maxine had a couple dozen " Stonewall Young Democrats " at her rally which she admitted having called for violence against Republican Cabinet Members &amp; impeachment lingo. Young minds were urged to commit criminal acts of violence.

@brithume Chances are the NYT story could be a concoction from some  renegade psyops friend or friends  of Brennan &amp; Clapper. Timing &amp; content is so convenient - obviously it is some type of monkey wrenching - bet 2 weeks from now a whole new B S concoction
@IngrahamAngle Seems like some type of democrat population control beyond Planned Parenthood which claims abortion / infanticide is a form of birth control
@IngrahamAngle It's apparent Obama &amp; family haven't done crap for Chicago - He ignores &amp; deflects the subject of his &amp; Michelle's home town massacres - 19,000 since his buddy Rahm took over democrat rulership Worse that Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Muslim self slaughter.
@Patrici15767099 Hillary will be over to the lesbian convention lick-a-tee split 👅 while the guys are still packing 🍩
@tgradous @benshapiro @realDailyWire The NYT excrement is the product of a psyops with the backing of Brennen &amp; Crapper - they've been very quiet lately lying low to the ground like snakes. Maybe they are planning a long Swiss vacation like Mark Rich !
@LivingAndLizing @DT48RasTanura @KrisParonto @MarkGeistSWP @JohnTiegen Benghazi 4 spirits will never die but Obama wants to kill them off again for his convenience!

@SenSanders How many types of photo I D does Crazy Bernie have to have with various requirements? It is so racist to say poor minorities can't easily get photo I Ds required by each state for non voting purposes. Talk about Bernie's lies &amp; deception !!!
@SenSanders Crazy Bernie is still a faithful Alinskyite with his same old " Rules for Radicals" techniques of mis/dis information &amp; mis leading fabrications...🦇💩
@cnni Unless they are Islamophobic CNN &amp; MSNBC Neo journalists should get back to rural Afghanistan &amp; let the folks know how wonderful &amp; inclusive they are ...🤣
@tmozdzierz @csgraphicsusa Is Gov.Cuomo giving the Arab hand gesture ? or the OK sign for the same desire?
@WorlMedia RADICAL ISLAMISTS are doing a favor by ringing the fire alarm &amp; their call to battle. Modern Western culture with our technology will defeat REINCARNATED MID EVIL INTELLECTUAL ZOMBIES 🤢
@Patrici15767099 One thing that has brought whites,blacks,latinos,asians, native Americans together with admiration &amp; respect for teammates is the UNITED STATES MILITARY COMMUNITY - especially combat veterans who know we all bleed the same &amp; have to back each other up !
@KrisParonto @jack @Twitter Taking on combat veterans with any kind of mortal confrontation is not a healthy endeavor these days. We all have back up &amp; some would welcome a " make my day" training event opportunity ⚔️🤣
@KrisParonto @jack @Twitter There is a real phenomenon of " death threats" but they are made by sniveling cowards who are scared to death of an actual physical confrontation to which they know would find them taking a dirt nap. Thank God for the 1st &amp; 2nd Amend.
@DutyOfAPatriot @pinkk9lover Obama should realize he has the right to remain silent any statements made can &amp; will be used to enlighten the truth. He can't have forgotten all the past recorded evidence to his current lies &amp; deceptions. His denial is evidence of a psychiatric problem!
@thehill Bob Woodward is trying to conjure up another deep throat relationship only with multiple partners. His geriatric fantasies play into the ongoing democrat hysteria.
@CorpsmanRetired Now Obama seems to be wiping up the democrat rear end for a diaper change but his verbal diarrhea is only adding to the hot stinking mess 💩
@PatriotJenn @RealShinyNickle @BarackObama All the veterans in Mesa County Colo. have Kris Paronto's back. Grand Junction V A Hospital is one of the best and everybody knows about the REAL BENGHAZI EVENT !!! There is a giant nest of deplorable smelly Walmart shoppers here ready for whatever happens...
@JudicialWatch Maxine Waters is the face of a public menace advocating political violence &amp; consorting with Castro brothers who harbor an American cop killer in Cuba which is her favorite vacation location. Waters also plays banking monkey business enriching family members.
@Love_The_Donald @ChrisMo37540912 Corey Booker is the face of democrat psychosis with Kamala's assistance!
@RealJamesWoods @JessieJaneDuff Corey Booker is the face of democrat psychosis with Kamala's assistance.
@KurtSchlichter The Obama regime enabled our enemies unprecedented access to our State Secrets threatening National Security! The camels nose was led into the tent with his helping hands. 🐫🐪
@WorlMedia The Muslim Waffle House server in Michigan should be fired &amp; deported back to her original shithole. Failure to serve Christians due to Sharia is just the " tip of the iceberg " from Hell.
@thehill Now the radical leftist liberal democrat socialists are going to get in a wad over the US trying to reverse their favorite failure in Venezuela 🇻🇪 So many sick people need help !
@MeMichelleAria @WorlMedia As to the French " migrant/ refugee " problem there is no dispute RADICAL ISLAMISTS ARE NOT BENIGN!!!
@MeMichelleAria @WorlMedia Thank you Michelle History can be confusing as to who writes it from what perspective etc. but it is my understanding there was a Muslim/Nazi SS Division under Hitler's leadership that helped round up Jews for the WW2 " final solution"
@ChuckCallesto Kamala Harris &amp; Corey Booker duo are obnoxious embarrassments to the U S Congress &amp; American Citizens. What a couple of jackasses !
@LauraLoomer @JesseBWatters @realDonaldTrump A very sad mistake that should have an apology &amp; further constructive understanding...
@thehill Coat hanger type activists can save their time &amp; energy &amp; do something constructive like shoving your coat hangers into #1 your eyes #2 up your anis #3 down your throat # 4 in your ears # 5 up your nose
@JudicialWatch @Mike_Beacham So much mainstream media mis/dis information is understood to be stinking garbage by intelligent American Citizens unless sheep &amp; lemming like people cow tow to radical leftist domestic enemies.
@thehill The " Hill" promulgates this mis/dis information. Don't fall for this type clandestine media garbage...
@WorlMedia There may be a point in time whereby the American Citizens realize we are under attack by a hydra headed monster called Radical Islam. We must not cow to being called Issalamiphobic (SIC)? Oh - ( Islamiphobic) Combat Veterans know how to take care of business
@RParis13 @kenameri1 It remains to be seen how many American Citizens see through Obama's ridiculousness &amp; phony ass facade. He is turning more &amp; more into a total creepy deceitful dishonest hoax!
@thehill Very much a tragedy about Botham Jean being shot by mistake. Actually very scary that could happen with no fault by him &amp; in his own home.
@MeMichelleAria @WorlMedia If you read &amp; understand English maybe do some real research on the WW2 Grand Mufti General appointed by Hitler to lead his Muslum Nazi SS Divsion to help round up Jews for the " final solution". They went back to Palestine &amp; had babies after the war🕷
@SebGorka @BarackObama Pathological lies indicate a sick mind &amp; COLLUSION WITH  ILLUSION...
@ManhattanInst @urbanophile @CityJournal Another proof Obamas Chicago organizing was his test ground for his  failed policies. His good buddy Rahm Emanuel found out the theoretical hypothetical socialist paradigm is a bag of excrement &amp; he can't maintain the illusion anymore .
@RedNationRising @BarackObama Obama has to wear asbestos pants cause traditional fabric keeps catching 🔥
@CNN Obama wants to be &amp; is in line to be no he is KING OF THE FAKE NEWS TRIBE! But but Butt head Corey doesn't hold a candle he can't stutter  for effect it just blurts out
@davidharsanyi @seanmdav Dismembering viable unborn babies is what leftist democrat socialists do, what they openly stand for &amp; who they are. All aiming for a totalitarian state where by live Conservatives may be treated like the unborn. 👹👺
@MattBracken48 @PoliticalShort The Arkansas Flu is contagious &amp; Brennan is a carrier.
@MattBracken48 @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump ARTICLE 4 SECTION 4 of the CONSTITUTION is proof radical leftist DEMOCRAT SOCIALISTS are DOMESTIC ENEMIES!  OBAMA IS KING of the TRIBE...
@WorlMedia The FRENCH PEOPLE  will only take so much of the ISLAMIST MERDE &amp; will STRIKE BACK! ⚔️ Sooner the better! Face it this is WAR !
@DrMartyFox @realDonaldTrump Obama is disliked by Israelis &amp; loved by the descendants of the Muslim Nazi SS Division led by Yasser Arafats uncle the " Grand Mufti" Hitler made him a general &amp; many Palestinians are related to them &amp; continue the WW2 mentality.

@tgradous @ReaganWorld @townhallcom Corey &amp; Kamala just plain don't have it all together - next act?
@thehill Leftist radicals have declared war on the duly elected President of the 🇺🇸 &amp; they have met their match with the back up of deplorable smelly Walmart shoppers. 1st &amp; 2nd A will prevail. Some subversives are still hiding in their closets but not for long...
@townhallcom It's what rabid leftist democrats do; they have time after time attacked innocent children of conservatives in a vile disgusting manner. It's who they are!
@FinancialTimes Pres.Trump is more of a conservative capitalist than the Chinese pretenders who will trip themselves up along the way (with a little help) unless they play nice...There are tricks to the trade!
@tgradous @EWErickson @resurgent Democrats have a hand full of 💩 &amp; not much else of anything very valid. Impeachment ? 🍑 makes good daiquiris just add a little rum sugar &amp; ICE in a blender - good stuff while watching democrat circus &amp; zoo entertainment 🍹
@DrMartyFox @GreggJarrett Sessions has TURNED into a never Trumper little weasel &amp; he is doing his own monkey wrenching. Does he or somebody like him like to write clandestine subversive &amp; anonymous screed ? More likely  Brennan or Crapper liaison 🐒🙈🐺🐍🐊🐀🐲🦂  -  ⏳⚔️

@thehill How many dozen spectators did Obama have? Doubt not many more than Hillary's measly showing Neither one garnished near the numbers of Pres.Trump ( wonder why) Can you imagine all those thousands of smelly Walmart shoppers together?
@Lrihendry @steph93065 BOYCOTT NIKEs ! They are made by political elites who outsource to Chinese slave labor. Same folks like Feinstein &amp; Biden families who have multi $ million Chinese government contracts. Dim whit socialists are just so many temp. useful idiots.
@WorlMedia FEMALE &amp; TRANS.  ( LGBTXYZ) CNN reporters who advocate Islamist garb will only be genuine if they get genital mutilations with proof of such. Otherwise they are the same old fraudulent pretenders.
@Pink_About_it @steph93065 Obama &amp; radical leftist democrat socialists count on Citizens with short memories &amp; others with no memories other than gimee gimee gimee. Only jobs Dems. create are more &amp; more &amp; more government jobs sucking off the taxpayers. GRIFTERS!
@TombStoneBub @DiamondandSilk There's are few brave Trump people in Aspen like Kurt Russel but like old times lots of sheep 🐑 running thru town leaving free fertilizer down Main Street

@deplorablem1ke @rial_rocks Millennials were cheated out of Bernie Sanders by Hillary &amp; DNC monkey wrenching business. They haven't done anything except with &amp; thru Antifa
@thehill Bob Woodward misses his old relationship with deep throat ( Mark Felt) &amp; fantasies about another fling. Carl Bernstein seems to be left out of the loopy loop da loop. Drugs &amp; alcohol have taken their toll but sensationalism is the bill of fare for both
@ChrisMo37540912 ICE, U S Border Patrol &amp; eventually the National Guard will be reinforced with private citizens protecting their families using their 2nd amendment rights. Individual landowners near the border have the right to protect themselves with deadly force.
@ChrisMo37540912 The Mexican drug cartels were thrilled Eric Holder &amp; Barry Obama shipped them State of the art full automatic military M-16 assault weapons that to which Americans have to have a Class 3 license. Obama &amp; Holder have the blood of thousands on their hands!
@JackPosobiec ORAL-DIARRHEA
@WorlMedia These outspoken ideologues are advertising themselves as domestic &amp; foreign enemies &amp; will be dealt with one way or ANOTHER ✡️✝️-China might lead the way !
@WorlMedia The founding fathers of our country foresaw the possibility of current events with bogus religious ideology&amp; provided 1st &amp; 2nd amendments. Luckily their are thousands &amp; thousands of combat veterans of all ages sworn to the U S Constitution. Sharia law?🐖🐷🐽
@CNNPolitics Democrat socialists are going bonkers with Pres.Trumps fabulous economic successes &amp; see a whole bunch of new golden geese they can squeeze but they are destined to get egg on their face. 🥚🍳

@WayneDupreeShow One is in the front the other is in the rear
@WayneDupreeShow Bernstein is trying for separate but equal positioning in parallel to his ex.
@WayneDupreeShow Woodward has fantasies of another " deep throat " relationship with the coordination of deep state player monkey wrenching.
@thehill Radical leftist liberal democrat socialists aspire to the likes of Venezuela, Cuba &amp; South Africa. The rejection of Pres.Trumps economic successes affirms this BENT OF MIND...
@TheEconomist Why would normal people assimilate the culture of protest rioters of aliens who commit prolific knife attacks, gang rapes &amp; organized thievery?
@StefanMolyneux Illegal alien crimes are like the " Duracell bunny" going on &amp; on &amp; on &amp; in &amp; on. Scratch the surface &amp; we are all animals - Scientists have watched primate behavior for years in correlation to human nature. WHAT'S THE ANSWER?
@WorlMedia Unfortunately European countries with thousands of migrant Islamists are going to experience more &amp; more of their cultural ways like gang rapes, knife stabbing &amp; butchering " of infidels " - Time will tell with more &amp; more. Leaders will sit back &amp; watch...
@thehill The classic divide &amp; conquer maneuver sometimes has a reverse result with devitating consequences...stand by...

@hrtablaze @coronationfail Screwy Louie benefited from the Malcom X assassination &amp; maybe he was in on it?
@realDailyWire Booker is a scheming scamming race baiter 🐍 snake in the grass! He will inevitably slither all over the place striking with venomous bites for the shear pleasure if it.
@coronationfail Democrats have exhibited their  rude crude simian type behavior &amp; down to earth, hard working,honest law abiding, Conservative American Citizens are smarter than a bunch of elite political monkeys have calculated !
@FoxNews @JMfreespeech @nytimes There has been obvious DNC/HRC/&amp; Obama regime security invasion by various &amp; multiple foreign intelligence agencies to their great embarrassment &amp;  affecting national security. Not surprising there would be some type of angry deflection reaction.
@FoxNews @JMfreespeech @nytimes Judith Miller is no stranger to " insider intrigue" structured as weaponized mis/dis information to cause harm to a selected target. There is obvious coordinated treachery at play here &amp; it is possible it could have a backfire result.
@chuckwoolery This Corey Booker body &amp; facial language is someone projecting an animal predator type reaction not unlike agitated simian behavior.
@DailyCaller This type Mis/Dis information psyops typically tries to speculate/"finger" a psychologically devastating figure close to the " target". This is a counter intelligence type maneuver.
@DailyCaller The " anonymous " letter is more probably a DISINFORMATION PSYOPS by some near nobody friend of Brennan,Clapper, Comey or cohort. Whole thing smacks of a subversion type operation typical of a radical communist technique!
@LauraLoomer @PollackHunter @AndrewPollackFL What about the Obama/Holder student violations forgiveness program,whereby delinquents have deferred discipline like the Parkland Fla.  murderer received after many infractions with no follow up guidance.
@GOP Tester sniffed too much airplane glue when he was a kid &amp; burned a few up stairs.
@SonnyBunch @redsteeze Avenatti proves again he's ripe to run like he's got the shits.

@rgspol @ACLJ 🦏
@KurtSchlichter Woodward is desperately seeking another deep throat relationship even if it turns out to be a geriatric fantasy.
@politico Woodward wants to get it on with another deep throat even if it is his geriatric fantasy. The New York Times apologized to its readers after Pres.Trump won admitting they did not cover the election accurately. Very few believe all that is written.
@HouseDemocrats Along with MS13 advocacy democrats want the continuance of  child trafficking with adult illegal criminals easy &amp; open nation wide travel. They are clearly domestic enemies of the Constitution.
@KurtSchlichter "Silent democrat protest actresses " are paid early Halloween trickster drama queen/clowns. Since there is so much bad democrat theater others should be able to bring rotten vegetables.
@thehill Woodward &amp; Bernstein's claim to fame came with handling " deep throat" in the 70s. Woodward is in dire need of cultivating another deep throat even if he/she is the basis for a novel. Neo journalists are creative writers over traditional reporters.
@CNN The democrat simian behavior continues to be displayed in D C on Capital hill proceedings. The democrat  monkey business/wrenching is open for all American Citizen Voters to witness.

@Imamofpeace @DarrkunGull Where can someone get one of those Halloween masks ? It looks like a ghost with 💄 lipstick but I can understand why some of them want bags over their heads. Most of them do look better that way plus they are easy to pick out from normal people.
@WorlMedia There just shouldn't be any military or V A medical coverage for those who have indulged in female genital mutilations. They should have their own witch doctors.
@WorlMedia Uniforms are by definition of uniform design. Of course it could be handy to be able to target the Muslims if need be during mortal combat.
@WorlMedia College students who want to castrate themselves are the type people who don't need to have their DNA remain in the gene pool. I'm sure a bunch of radical Jihadi Islamists could help them out. Of course the jihadis would want dine on the removed parts.
@SenFeinstein Next to Hillary Clinton,Dianne Feinstein has been a total disaster in regard to Chinese &amp; Russians gleaning thousands of national security secrets by their more than lax - CRIMINAL computer &amp; electronic communication device practices &amp; procedures !
@rgspol @ACLJ For seemingly very intelligent (data systems design etc.) &amp; former military &amp; theoretically protector of the USConstitution, it's a shame you don't/didn't see what was going down with the Clinton/Obama scenario. Both love the Saul Alinsky paradigm.

@thehill If Nike is waxing politically leftist they will be left behind - TFB
@thehill Seems like Woodward takes glee in adding lubrication to the radical leftist " slippery slope" which may see him losing his own footing.
@WorlMedia Have a feeling there will be similar actions by Patriotic American Veterans pushing back against radical  leftist liberal activists who are dumping on conservatives.
@LionelMedia @JessieJaneDuff Abusive behavior &amp; vitriolic tweets are a constant torrent by radical leftist democrat socialists &amp; domestic enemies of the Constitution &amp; are accepted by Twitter but conservative vitriolic tweets are not- XX
@rgspol @ACLJ It would be somebody else! - you expose yourself with your over confidence in siding with domestic enemies which may not be taken well by people who don't want to see radical leftist socialists have more influence than they already have.
@acs5353 @davidpwil The simian behavior of democrat monkey wrenchers has fallen to a new low. Ape like screeching &amp; baboon like antics are beyond monkey business.

@FoxNews KARL MARX never had a job, he never owned property, Marx never held political office ( not even dog catcher), he never owned or ran any kind of business - he was only good at being able to blackmail or grifter money . He was a TOTAL LOSER CON MAN
@esaagar @DailyCaller @POTUS @TheDCVince The screeching ape sounds &amp; baboon behavior indicates so many DEEP SEATED MENTALLY ILL DEMOCRATS are presenting in an insane manner.
@WorlMedia Remember France gave us the Statue of Liberty - Viva la France LEAD THE WAY FOR EUROPE - slice &amp; dice
@DailyCaller Democrats need to bag the hags if they want to get anywhere...EMBARRASSMENTS but good for the walkers ( Jonny Walker Black or Red) 🥃
@JackPosobiec @steph93065 Obama did think at one time " if you want to keep your preacher you can keep your preacher ". Unless you decide it's politically expedient to throw him off the train in front of a bus &amp; have it back over him but then picked up Screwy Louie.
@RedNationRising If Sen.Feinstein &amp; husband weren't in bed with Chinese government contracts she might be interested in following the U.S.Constitution. Feinstein family has made $ millions from the Chinese &amp; no wonder they had their monitor firmly in place. SECRETS? 🤡
@CNNPolitics Democrat monkey wrenching with ape like screeching &amp; baboon behavior in Congress is how the neo democrats have evolved. They all deserve Darwin awards. When will PETA come to their aid &amp; support?

@TheMarkPantano @FiveRights Harris is totally on board with the over all democrat baboon behavior allowing uncontrolled apelike screeching in Congress.
@TheMarkPantano @FiveRights Kamala Harris loves monkey wrenching Congressional proceedings with her monkey business. " Spank her monkey "
@JordanSchachtel @SebGorka Feinstein had  no shame when it came to spreading her legs revealing her intimate life for her Chinese handyman. The National Security was screwed in the process.
@tgradous @FoxNews There is now ongoing uncivilized democrat monkey wrenching &amp; baboon type disruptive democrat behavior during the Congressional proceedings. This vividly demonstrates monkey type democrat leadership. 🐒🐵
@tgradous @FoxNews It is obvious for all American Citizen voters to see &amp; hear the democrats have gone nuclear in their desire to be totally disruptive &amp; resistant to anything that Conservative American Citizens &amp; government officials present to the nation.
@tgradous @DennisPrager The fact that Karl Marx never had a job, never held a political position, never owned a business, never owned property gives the Florida socialist candidate a solid foundation of belief &amp; working knowledge of how to lead people &amp; economy.
@tgradous The orchestration of lemmings is a phenomenon to behold. Especially those with " front holes" ( this is now P.C. so fall in line!)
@JudicialWatch It's entertaining to see the McCauliff &amp; McCabe threads being pulled because it unravels so much of what holds swamp creatures together. Money, power &amp; limitless ambition is both glue &amp; lubricant the he'll with morals &amp; the Constitution.
@WorlMedia The U.S. leftist liberal democrat socialists &amp; their little girls will follow what ever the U.N. Human Rights Commission &amp; World Court tells them to do. So the Muslim Clerics have an open field with quite a selection for their choosing.
@WorlMedia The Muslim cleric interviewed by BBC should know there are thousands of leftist liberal women socialists raising little girls in the U.S. claiming they aren't Islamiphobic. There is prime availability for them and or their little girls to marry.

@bsgirl2u @CB618444 Hillary go for broke when you go down. Thanks for admitting there is so much monkey business in D.C. &amp; a wrench like you could certainly turn some nuts.
@rovaz1218 @CorpsmanRetired Swift boat Kerry's crew celebrated when he wrote himself up for a 3rd Purple Heart which got him out of Vietnam short of his full tour of duty. The guy was a JFK wannabe but ended up a chicken shit fraud...
@thehill Was Rick Davis really partners with Manafort during the 08 McCain campaign? Did he coordinate with Russians in any manner?
@CorpsmanRetired Is one of the symptoms of the Arkansas flu severe irreversible lead poisoning? A ( corpse man) might know...
@rgspol @ACLJ Sounds like Ron Simpson has been breathing bilge fumes from his gas guzzling oil spewing stink pot flying a false flag. Sailboats are so much more eco-friendly &amp; esthetically pleasing but they take more skill to operate. Jibing can wack your gourd...
@DineshDSouza The progressive democrats still get off on LBJ's johnson that took a two hand grip to wag or wave at his select guests as a persuader 🐊
@newsbusters @Italians4Trump Take Kerry's passport &amp; security clearance away then check him into a Federal Country Club for 50 years until he mummifies

@RedNationRising Screw Netflix &amp; their Rice burner...
@RedNationRising The three amigos have lots of blood &amp; dead American soldiers in their hands- so decent ! 🤥
@Only1Tabatha @JBaker31826004 Goslings are baby geese. How's his baby goose steps?
@politico Theresa needs some dance lessons the Africans were laughing 😂 &amp; her husband almost feinted.
@thehill What's decent about media complicity avoidance &amp; denial of a serial rapist?
@jakepalmieri @rial_rocks Mueller has no jurisdiction or power to indite Pres.Trump. He needs a kick in the ass &amp; get run off down the road ! Take his security clearance in the process !
@JudicialWatch Maxine Waters is a riot instigating bio hazard hag &amp; a threat to National Security. Advocating violent riots &amp; personal threats to government officials in her position is a Federal felony
@thehill How did McCains " wet start" of his jet fighter to freak out the F4 pilot behind him cook off the rocket that blew up McCains plane in turn blowing up his 1000lbs. bomb &amp; starting catastrophic fire &amp; explosions on the Forrestal killing the F4 pilot &amp; 120 more
@GreggJarrett @patriotsuzy Kick Sessions in the ass &amp; throw out the no good bum - the old fart is a bag of methane gas
@John_KissMyBot @jeromegravesbm1 Ocasio-Cortez has learned well from her reptilian socialist professors &amp; the Saul Alinsky/Karl Marx psyops techniques. Thing is it's gonna be just a matter of time before the realization of rational thought over emotional manipulation kicks in...
@DRUDGE_REPORT Excellent Roger L. Simon analysis of an on going American tragedy &amp; historical exercise of Constitutional procedures !
@marklutchman @CorpsmanRetired Stop taxpayer subsidies to a money making baby body parts sales &amp; distribution machine ! No Constitutional right to profit from killing viable babies ! Talk about rationalizing pathological practices &amp; not recognizing mental illness ? SICK !
@CB618444 Our Constitution preempts the opinion we should not have our own opinions discussed freely especially when it comes to personal safety from criminal/animal predators lurking in our neighborhoods. Thousands of innocent children have been prey!
@DineshDSouza Did Johnson use two hands?
@thehill Maybe Judge Judy could give Mueller some hints about how to buzz off...she could chew his ass out &amp; get an Emmy 🤣
@thehill Mueller has NO JURISDICTION to subpoena Pres.Trump &amp; can only fantasize to boost his limited Constitutional power. It will be entertaining to see him piss in the wind. Hope he shits his pants!
@patriotsuzy @DarrkunGull @foxandfriends @SchmittNYC Rag heads might be forgetting a few things if they've lost their minds.
@WorlMedia No place for radical islamists in America. Sharia law is unConstitutional in the United States. Muslims who pledge allegiance to the USA are welcome. ALL ISLAMIST SHARIA LAW FOLLOWERS GET THE HELL OUT !

@JasonWalker75 @tgradous @JamesNortheimer @OriginalSethro @orderofman @HeavyArmedVet @becomingaforce @PeteinNewJersey @The_Gent49 @AwareIntegrate Why do BLTs disregard chromosome proof of only 2 sexes ? Virtual reality simply doesn't get it - Good acting techniques create great illusions but doesn't change science.
@janetgag1 @thehill Janetgag will gag on actual reality. Virtual reality is the name of the bot game which Hillary &amp; the Radicals ( good name for a reality show or metal band) reincarnated from Saul Alinsky. Only it is a con !
@jim_fowlds Entertaining Antifa creatures are getting good at stand up comedy by flopping all around up against LEOs. What a riot! The riot mob mentality always loses in the long run - bring pop corn to the next feature...
@plasticexistenc @janetgag1 @thehill Maybe the blue wave will be Zombies with cyanotic complexions washing up on Dahmer Island ?
@kenameri1 @liroje2002 Sessions looks more like a pip squeak mouse than sewer rat , but could be some mutation of both.
@RealFrankFromFL @kenameri1 @RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum Socialists can't win an argument by discussing the economic history of failed Nazi/Communist socialism. They can only try to denigrate opponents with emotional concoctions that have no real actual substance. Understanding Saul Alinsky says it all .
@CNNPolitics Kissing up to Ted Kennedy like he was a man of honor always kept Mary Jo alive. Calling grass root American Citizen " TEA PARTY" Patriots " WACKOs is part of the reason deplorables got Pres.Trump elected &amp; will keep him in office after 2020.
@thehill Any Obama endorsements could be the kiss of death in the near future !⏳
@ChuckCallesto Socialists can't win an economic argument by discussing economic history so they try to infect immature naive brains with ideations of getting stuff for free taken away from rich people. Won't work long for soft target tyrants.
@WorlMedia Hollywood sellebs will do the country a favor by going on strike &amp; while they're at it move out of the country.The youth will have a chance to cleanse their minds &amp; take out the garbage...
@LindaForAmerica @steph93065 John Kerry just perpetuates the reality of his RVN swift boat PERSONAL DISHONOR as witnessed &amp; co-o berated by his crew mates. He was a show boat JFK wanna be but became a chicken shit fraud.
@brithume Amazing how Radicals despise revelations of reality &amp; real truth with classic avoidance &amp; denial - (mental illness) Pray for them!
@thehill John "swift boat " Kerry will have his Iranian collusion collaboration conspiracy revealed in daylight sunshine- Talk about " monkey business"! The " follow the money" trip to Iran is documented TV history &amp; we are supposed to just bend over?
@JacobAWohl @OliverMcGee Typical low information democrats won't be able to fathom what is really happening &amp; what really went down with the democrat/Russian monkey wrenching whereby American Citizen voters were/are psychologically manipulated by democrat/Russian XX " psyops"!
@kenameri1 American Citizens are now realizing ineffective feckless Sessions is a shill XX plant MONKEY WRENCHER - get rid of the bum. He's made his mark in history &amp; will not be remembered well...

@Uncle_Jimbo @steph93065 It is quite sick that radical leftist democrat socialists advocate &amp; promote American Flag desecration to promote their version of the 1st A Want to see another type of launch time?- Try doing it to an astronaut suit with one inside!
@DineshDSouza Too bad Lady Bird couldn't TWEEET !
@DineshDSouza It's part of history LBJ loved to flash his " Johnson" for shock effect to " deminish" the smaller people in his presence.
@RealJamesWoods Poor Flakey just can't keep up with Bubba in a decent manner &amp; the guy does it to himself 🤣
@Sniper64286433 @ChrisMo37540912 Might want to do a Maxine, Nancy, Frankenstein combo ceremony ?
@politico Impeachment proceedings toward Pres.Trump will produce another opportunity to reveal democrat treasonous treachery &amp; Panetta is clever enough to realize the suicidal danger !
@Kasparov63 So kasparov63 what are YOU going to do with your hate ? You do some kind of violent revenge trip like your type advocates &amp; you will experience bodda Bing BODDA 💥 BOOM ass wipe
@Barnett20Todd @ChrisMo37540912 What about Rick Davis , McCain campaign leader &amp; Paul Manafort partner introduced McCain to the Russian $billionaire aluminum magnate for trade deals? Same Russian helped coordinate the 1/2 hour Trump Tower fizzle scam to discredit Jr.
@ChuckCallesto Obama's supreme arrogance will eventually bite him in the ass. It will be revealed Obama was privy to all the anti-Trump MONKEY BUSINESS &amp; the monkey business continues but could uncork a volcano 🌋
@YoungDems4Trump Explosive fire shooting out from jet engines can cook off rockets on a plane behind in close proximity in turn blowing up the plane in front. What really happened on the Forrestal ?!
@YoungDems4Trump "Wet engine " jet fighter staring trick &amp; behind the scene inside trading deals tell another story.
@thehill Race baiters are the source for race baiting assault weapons &amp; help perpetuate scorched earth racial conflicts &amp; tactics.
@grizzlemeister @CorpsmanRetired Hollywood elites are caught up with their own self importance &amp; leftist " liberal" agenda. They are very liberal with the truth.
@eeynouf @CorpsmanRetired Mueller's inner reality is in conflict with the original intent of the US Constitution. Poisonous plants provide poisonous fruit. PUKE
@thehill Emotional reactions can cause trouble for rational decisions. Some people prefer split tongue two face shuck &amp; jive politicians over  experienced &amp; successful business executives.
@thehill Pres.Trump was closer to Mother Nature than anybody at the McCain celebration. Blue sky's, sunshine &amp; clean fresh air! The ALL SEEING EYE knows truth over scripted drama...&amp; knows what you are thinking at any given time.
@JudicialWatch Maxine Waters had brought sedition to a whole new current spectacle of political puss oozing out of democrat carbuncles. 😷🤢⏳
@thehill Once again THE HILL makes a garbage run but missed the dump
@thehill Does decency include the blood on Clinton,Bush,Obama's hands from foreign disasters ? Many feel there was decent descent by Donald Trump over 42-43-44 debacles !
@thehill Such sorry jealous envy of a successful golf/country club developer by a bunch of lemming losers !
@thehill America has always been great but had an 8 cancer which is now in remission. AMERICA is now better &amp; in a GREAT OBSERVABLE REBOUND under Pres.Trump but there are still a few radical cells threatening a return.
@JackPosobiec Ebonics &amp; pig Latin are the low IQ alternative next to comic book illustrations for the illiterate products of fundamental transformation
@stevewightman1 @RJbulldog The Forrestal Aircraft Carrier had the worst fire,death &amp; destruction since WW2. McCain's goofing around caused it. Since then there has been no worse. The Captain &amp; McCains Admiral father deflected the responsibility &amp; McCain skated. Karma capture?
@stevewightman1 @RJbulldog McCain did a " wet start trick "to freak out the F-4 pilot behind him. The excessive explosive heat from his jet engine cooked off a rocket on the F-4 which in turn hit McCains plane which carried a 1000lbs. bomb. F-4 pilot fried 💀 as McCain boogied.
@JudgeJeanine Sessions must be secretly enjoying screwing the President &amp; he's acting like an albatross wrapped around Trumps neck &amp; the haters are loving it. Sessions is in effect a XX agent on negativity &amp; he needs to get his ass out of the way. DUD DUDE!
@WayneDupreeShow If President Trump makes a real "hole in one" it will be no surprise cause he's getting better all the time &amp; keeps cool under fire.
@BreitbartNews All American tourists would be wise to learn basic improvised weapon defense techniques. Umbrellas 🌂 with metal tips, stout stock canes, local hardware items like ball peen hammers,screw drivers, camera mono pods, rocks in socks for starters. 🔧🔨🔦🍴🌂🖊
@TracyAChambers Sad Meghan had such an angry tone at the wrong time &amp; place when a voice of kindness &amp; forgiveness would have been more appropriate. The desired absence of Sarah Palin deserves a eulogy in itself.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery The democrats love the walking dead cause they don't need or have picture I Ds. Beware of the Zombies !
@Conservative_VW @mdj17 When shit for brains run out of toilet paper they look to Venezuela for a back ordered resupply. Don't do do their third world LEFT HANDED HAND SHAKE !
@DineshDSouza Here we are looking into the precipice &amp; the devils want to push the Conservative Patriotic American Citizens into their inferno. Thank God for the first &amp; second amendment &amp; the wisdom of honest down to earth, educated, hard working American Citizen...
@thehill Anti ICE activists need to get closer to their bon fire so they can experience first hand the collapse &amp; consuming nature of their creation. Did antifa cannibals  bring bar-b-q sauce ?
@thehill NFL kneeling is just a way of monkey wrenching the American public with political monkey business.
@BernardKerik @MeghanMcCain Very sad to experience such an angry delivery by Meghan McCain at a time more appropriate to kindness &amp; forgiveness. Emotions so often trump deeper thoughtful process.
@TrumpsBelle @CB618444 Just another outward display of the bishops sense of entitlement with his carnal heart &amp; the other little brain. At least he doesn't seem to have the proclivity of a BLT or so many Catholic priests.
@PradRachael @CB618444 Some meritorious people can rise above hollow words &amp; gestures meant to be so lofty but in reality are very low &amp; demeaning. Sarah Palin maintains dignity in the face of deceit...
@cnnbrk Too bad some show boat grand standing democrats don't feel America &amp; our Devine U S Constitution is not or ever was great. Unfortunately they will probably never be better than their low life opinions which are trying to drag us down into hell.
@reg1776 Slack jaw always looks like he wants to catch bugs.
@ChrisMo37540912 Maybe Bobbies can defend them selves with concealed polish sausages ?
@foxandfriends @dbongino Members of main stream media should launch demonstration marches across main steam America in protest of  their biased reactions. (🍅🥚🍋🍇🍆🌽🍉🍌🍎) But beware of these assault weapons.
@ChrisMo37540912 Will the stores have a BLT section ?
@Mike_Beacham It's a shame McCain didn't become President because he was not a snake 🐍 Now there are slithering serpent deep state operatives subverting the original intent of the U S Constitution...
@DailyCaller @BillClinton @ArianaGrande Bill can be seen fantasizing Ariana wearing a blue dress after the funeral

@klycward @thehill Kelly you are so worn out with all the overworked race card scenario &amp; barking up the wrong trees with your hackneyed false narrative Russian diatribe. Democrat socialist losers can't win an argument with historical facts you just get in the gutter
@newsbusters @Italians4Trump @CNN Lanny Davis is as smooth as grease &amp; slick as snake oil having associated with the Clintons for years but he couldn't stop Bubba from being impeached - &amp; democrat losers are mad as hell again with a loser attorney's screw ups 🤣😷
@klycward @thehill Sorry for your Russia on the brain condition. You are probably going to need psychiatric counseling / therapy before the next 2 yrs. over. Your favorite democrat losers are the ones more culpable of Russian MONKEY BUSINESS participation.
@AnnCoulter What about Rick Davis partners with Paul Manafort during the 08 election. Davis introduced McCain to the Russian $ billionaire aluminum magnate to coordinate some trade deals. Same Russian close to Putin who helped hype the Trump Tower caper.
@realDailyWire Sounds like Sean Casten ( who the hell?) has no answers to anything other than how he takes out the garbage accumulating in his brain. More sorry ass shuck &amp; jive mantra diatribe with false narrative based on false premise by a leftist weakling.
@klycward @thehill Radical leftist liberal democrat socialists are scared to death by Pres.Trumps successes and good ratings compared to previous do little losers. The conservative American Citizens have awakened to &amp; smell  the garbage democrats force feed
@klycward @thehill Absolutely no coincidence I chose MONKEY WRENCH - MONKEY BUSINESS - GREASE MONKEY It is a reflection of all the democrat MONKEY SHINES going on with false, fake narratives &amp; false premises using race baiting &amp; race cards in the SORRY ASS MSM
@thehill " The Hill" &amp; CNN Pres.Trump hater Neo journalists are sort of like dirty grease monkeys 🐒 throwing monkey wrenches around in a primate frenzy making lots of monkey sounds, pounding their chests &amp; preening each other for lice
@MattBracken48 Now the only people with knives, machetes, meat cleavers, axes &amp; hatchets in London England are the growing number of Jihadi Islamists. The walking dead were told they have " Islamaphobia "
@coronationfail Good point about punishing the pigs but it could be a science project to analyze the pig vomit of a rejected Jihadi 🐷🐖
@JackPosobiec It has been revealed the FBI leadership were a bunch of hacks subverting the U S Constitution they swore allegiance to. How can honest law abiding down to earth Patriotic Conservative American Citizens trust their Fidelity or Integrity again?
@ByronYork @elianayjohnson It is being said Sen.John McCain loved many different types &amp; kinds of people no matter what race or religion, back ground or bank account &amp; was a fearless hero &amp; champion but for whatever reason he disliked the grass roots people of the Tea Party. 😢🤧😱
@DRottiemom @rial_rocks @GenFlynn @POTUS This creepy little sharia Islamist rat should be injected , rejected &amp; fed to a pig farm🐀🐷
@robjantonelli @LND19812 @FoxNews @AndrewGillum @RepDeSantis @ShepNewsTeam So many Neo journalists are becoming like dirty grease monkeys throwing P.C. monkey wrenches into just about every thing they get their dirty grease monkey hands on 🐒🔧
@steve_hanke @AmericanThinker Democrat socialists are entitled to suck off tax payers &amp; squeeze the golden geese for their " fair share". like many environmental parasites they have genetic defenses to healthy cures.
@Stonewall_77 @steph93065 @CNNPR NEO JOURNALISTS are becoming more like DIRTY GREASE 🐒 MONKEYS throwing their MONKEY WRENCHES into American politics,economy,schools, churches,U S Constitution, judicial system, Law Enforcement, military - In effect many are lying 🤥 enemies !

@SebGorka San Fransisco's democrat  products include lots of public feces &amp; urine. Seems like the NM judge is a reflection of her origin.
@BernieSanders Old Commie Bernie wants other people's money (tax payers) to work like a carrot behind his big socialist stick. Free stuff is the lure for lazy thieves who mug &amp; eventually kill their targets.
@MattBracken48 @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Fathoming the deep state is like taking water depth measurements of every six feet on an underway riverboat. Mark Twain would love calling out the measurements revealing the snags &amp; obstructions. They are currently very numerous !
@DineshDSouza NEO JOURNALISTS are more like monkey wrenching GREASE MONKEYS 🐒
@DineshDSouza Obviously there is TONS OF MONKEY WRENCHING going on toward Pres.Trump.
@marcorubio @NATO @SenJohnMcCain @USNATO Senator McCain like all mortal humans &amp; or heroes was no saint or perfect person. Like anybody he had his faults but his admirable positive  qualities out shown &amp; surpassed the negative aspects of his personality &amp; history.
@DineshDSouza MONKEY WRENCHING is a common term &amp; the  analogy of like throwing a monkey wrench into the gears or works of some ongoing system to like "gum up the works ". It is NOT A RACIAL TERM - calling it racial is itself monkey wrenching.
@ByronYork @MichaelJMorell Asiri losing his ass is pay back for him having his brother Abdullah shove a bomb up his ass...

@WSJ Is it true Hollywood oral agreements often  have sexual connotations ? Suck it up butter cup ?
@thehill Pots calling the kettles black...Oh no that is so racist !🤣
@thehill Radical leftist democrat socialists never quit razing &amp; playing their race card to obfuscate reality when in fact they are pot heads calling ??? how does it go ? It is so racist 🦇💩
@RealCandaceO @klages_phil @CNN @NAACP @JeffreyToobin Toobin is proving to be out of touch with reality but what's new?
@1Romans58 @jim_fowlds At least the leftist revolutionaries are soft targets for radical Islam when it becomes time for jihad against deviants &amp;  useful idiots who are kissing up to them with misplaced bumbling.
@LauraLoomer What's the big deal about Obama not being totally black ? He's simply a wolf in black sheep skin &amp; continues to monkey wrench behind the scenes like a good seditious provocateur and what is Valerie doing are they still living together?
@ChuckCallesto Reich seems really pissed 🤣 With name like Reich he must have Hitler's ghost looking over his shoulder &amp; has lost his balance &amp; bearings. Reich thought his past pandering to Clintons would land him a nice czar type job. NOT GONNA HAPPEN 2 BAD !!!

@JustSimon13 @DarrkunGull Wonder if rabid leftist democrat feminazis want to sample one of their new " cause celeb" jihadi type creatures celebration of female genital mutilation with a little gay neck stretching exercise thrown in ?
@MattBracken48 With the reality of the  NM terrorist training / living compound and democrat release of the would be " active shooters" &amp; mass slaughter is the typical reaction of radical leftist liberal democrat mind set. BIG TROUBLE DOWN THE ROAD !!!
@WayneDupreeShow Democrat history can be embarrassing &amp; is often conveniently surpassed &amp; or rewritten. 🙈🙉🙊
@WayneDupreeShow The whims of the " elite" are considered by them as to what is best for the " commoners " who they consider not too smart - SURPRISE -THE U S CONSTITUTION RULES !!!
@WayneDupreeShow Kiddies are not taught about civics , American History foundation of our roots &amp; the U S Constitution. They are indoctrinated with the notion of a " living Constitution " which can be interpreted &amp; changed with the changing trends of the times WRONG!
@CNNPolitics The corrupt Puerto Rican democrat machine people skim  &amp; scam to take care of themselves &amp; friends first with inefficient handling of the " commoners "They fudged on specifics from the get go but are pretty good at political extortion.
@thehill Andrew Gillum will reach over &amp; grab kick scratch &amp; punch the other kids in the sand box to get their toys. He doesn't know how to make them or earn honest money to buy them. His like minded thieves rationalize taking from rightful property owners.
@TheEconomist Socialists are like the type of little kids in the sand box that reach over &amp; grab, kick, scratch &amp; punch other little kids to get their toys. They then cry &amp; blubber with gooey snot running down their nose if they are reprimanded. 🐒
@dbongino Sanders &amp; Gillum are raising their ugly heads( with questionable brain matter) BRAINS MATTER ! They want people to goose step down the road to Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, North &amp; South Africa &amp; what ever socialist shit hole they want.
@JackPosobiec @negativesam Radical leftist democrat elites aspire to something like the Chinese paradigm - Too bad Islam is unacceptable. What are YOU going to do about two face chicken shit hypocrites?
@TracyAChambers @BreitbartNews Bernstein has turned himself into a has been hack &amp; has lost objectivity. Intelligent people realize he's desperate for acceptance &amp; likes grandstanding.
@realDailyWire Trump hating media people don't fool the more well informed, aware &amp; educated conservative American Citizens. The haters pander to haters &amp; low I Q - low information dolts.
@JackPosobiec Average Americans  in the street know when they smell false narratives like they may see &amp; hear if watching Pres.Trump haters in the media. The Trump haters only fool themselves and only influence like minded Trump haters. Love Trumps hate !
@thehill There are social media ( celebrated?) pictures of the Jacksonville lunatic trashing Pres.Trump. He was reportedly a virulent vile radical democrat.
@WayneDupreeShow Florida may be among the states that are heading toward being little Venezuelas if a democrat/socialist/communistic enclaves but  hopefully not like South Africa as some would wish.
@BreitbartNews Pelosi has been is trying so hard to be relevant but doesn't quite get it...
@marklevinshow That should be HELTER STELTER (gremlins in the system?!)
@marklevinshow Heater Stelter doesn't care if  he " intentionally mis speaks " his distorted version of his truth. He doesn't realize what an evil clown image he has created in the eyes of conservatives. 🤡
@Uncle_Jimbo @MattBracken48 Chuck Todd and similar "elites" are so caught up in their own bubble head world of Trump hating they have lost &amp; have grossly distorted perspectives to where they are almost totally blind to the truth of their pathetic agenda...
@Surabees @JackPosobiec @CNN It's wonderful how desperate journalist Trump haters grab at their own manufactured phony facts &amp; distortions of the truth to advance their pathetic agenda get caught &amp; like children deny deny deny the actual truth. 🤣Diabolical fantasy land !
@ChrisMo37540912 Disrespect for the laws of the land &amp; law enforcement is a poor strategy for the radical leftist liberal democrats.They provide sanctuary &amp; promote violent resistance to the U S Constitution. They are the domestic enemies that will be dealt with !
@JackPosobiec Bubba Clinton was a regular guest at Epstein's invitation at the Caribbean sex orgy Island
@reg1776 @BreitbartNews The special needs stick boy &amp; the Jacksonville lunatic shooter have the same thing in common hating President Trump &amp; being a rabid leftist democrat sympathizer...
@thehill What about Rick Davis,partners with Paul Manafort introducing McCain to a Russian $billionaire aluminum magnate to do some lucrative trade deals? Same Russian helped set up the bogus Trump Tower meeting under the watchful eyes of the FBI !
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Keeping documents away from Judicial Watch is beyond circumstantial evidence those responsible are some of the most corrupt evil creatures in Washington D.C. EVIL CREATURES!!!
@Cernovich Lanny Davis is as smooth as grease &amp; as slick as snake oil. He had to be associating with Clintons !
@newsmax @BernardKerik Granting easy bail for dangerous illegals is something most rabid radical democrat judges do especially in their sanctuary cities on a regular basis. Citizens be damned! Shit on the sidewalks is good for you!
@MattBracken48 Feinsteins good buddy Biden &amp; son have multi-million dollar contracts with the Chinese government! How bout them 🍎 apples?
@realDailyWire The Jacksonville Fla. Lunatic was a rabid Trump hater radical leftist democrat. He sucked up the Maxine Waters &amp; Pelosi's call for violence &amp; Brennan's blood in the streets wish
@DebraAnnJanes2 @CNNPolitics Wrong HoneyBunny - wait N C !
@Chief_Lawman What about the McCain's " wet jet engine start" to freak out the F4 pilot behind him that cooked off the rocket that blew up McCains plane &amp; his 1000 lbs. bomb? The F4 pilot became a crispy critter &amp; McCain boogied. The Forrestal burned killing many sailors !
@thehill What about Rick Davis partners with Paul Malafort &amp; McCains  campaign manager ? Davis introduced McCain to a Russian $ billionaire aluminum magnate to do some trade deals. He's the same Russian who helped coordinate the phony Trump Tower scam. What about that
@DebraAnnJanes2 @CNNPolitics It takes some intelligence type homework to dig up historical facts dove tailing with today. Eventually you will read it else where !
@DebraAnnJanes2 @CNNPolitics It's ALL history that takes some intelligence type homework beyond gooogooo
@thehill What about Rick Davis partners with Paul Manafort &amp; McCain's 08 campaign manager? Davis introduced McCain to a Russian $billionaire aluminum magnate to coordinate some trade deals. What is wet starting a jet engine that cooked off a rocket?
@CNNPolitics What about Rick Davis McCains 08 campaign manager partners with Paul Manafort &amp; collaborated with a Russian $ billionaire aluminum magnate friend of Putin for some aluminum trade deals thru McCain. The same Russian who helped hype up the Trump Tower meeting??
@jihadwatchRS @MattBracken48 Democrats like to create self fulfilling prophesies &amp; then scream &amp; cry about it - Who was Saul Alinsky ?
@jihadwatchRS @MattBracken48 Radical leftists seem to create self fulfilling prophesies for conservative American Citizens to respond. Thank God for the 1st &amp; 2nd amendment &amp; Constitution Article 5. Dry powder!
@kimusastrong @RealShinyNickle It's to be expected scum bag neo journalists try to out do each other with some type of sensationalized garbage using creative writing they claim is gospel but only has a small amount of anything approaching truth. They love the gutter.
@kimusastrong @RealShinyNickle Some things never change with lefties they just become chronic &amp; acute but main stream Americans see through main stream media B S &amp; propaganda
@AnOpenSecret @JackPosobiec Seems like Catholics are " up a creek" with a left leaning Pope part of the LGBT community. How many genders does he count or recognize?Its just the type of subject that gives radical Islam talking points for more jihad - GeeWhiz !
@thehill Graffiti swastikas on ambulances is typical of low I Q turds not associated with intelligent honest hard working Patriotic American Citizens. Radical leftist democrats, Antifa &amp; leaders advocating violence &amp; blood in the streets don't have 1st amend. rights.
@WorlMedia Lilly Allen can take advantage of her opportunities in Venezuela ,Cuba,North or South Africa- good luck &amp; too F ing bad!
@realDailyWire It's just not fair - trans men don't menstruate &amp; trans women don't have sperm &amp; prostate glands. Plus there is no way to change male/female chromosomes where the " proof is in the pudding"- but I guess we can PRETEND with good acting.
@PatriotNotPol @steph93065 Radicals are setting up the country for a pandemic of contagion 😷
@PatriotNotPol @steph93065 Now thousands of American Citizens exposed to purulent tuberculosis from ILLEGAL ALIENS flooding the country. The poor &amp; undernourished especially at risk in sanctuary cities. Radical leftist democrats are quickly turning their territories into 3rd world
@thehill The same Russian was instrumental in the Trump Tower meeting under the watchful eyes of GUESS WHAT AGENCY?
@thehill What about Rick Davis McCains 08 campaign manager &amp; partners with Paul Manafort? Davis was friends with a Russian $ billionaire aluminum magnate &amp; got McCain together with him over aluminum trad deals!
@thehill What about the $ millions Biden &amp; his son are making with Chinese trade deal agreements &amp; partnership ? What about that? The Frankenstein &amp; Biden Chinese partnerships are troubling don't you think?
@thehill What about Rick Davis McCains 08 campaign manager who was Paul Manafort's partner at that time. Davis was friends with a Russian billionaire aluminum magnate &amp; got McCain together with him to do aluminum trade deals.
@thehill What about Rick Davis McCains 08 campaign manager was partners with Paul Manafort at the time &amp; introduced McCain to aRussian billionaire aluminum magnate to witch they played footsies. The FBI warned McCain to back off from the Russian massage...
@thehill What about Rick Davis , McCains 08 campaign manager was Manaforts partner &amp; also introduced McCain to a Russian billionaire concerning aluminum trade deals? Same players including Russians were playing footsies with McCain ! What about that - FBI told McCain!
@foxandfriends Tiger Woods father was an Intelligence Officer &amp; now Tiger is showing some intelligence...
@cnni @StCollinson Maybe there will be a U turn on a two way street ?
@DataGenesis There might be need for expansion of a Federal Country Club to accommodate swamp creatures. Something like Devils Island might be  a " solution".
@townhallcom Rabid left demonic creatures are trying to create chaos by polarizing American Citizens &amp; the rule of law supported by LEOs. Thank God &amp; the Founding Fathers , the 1st &amp; 2nd Amendments &amp; the U S Constitution ( original intent)
@mollyfprince @DailyCaller Is it true the Jacksonville lunatic was a rabid leftist anti-Trump creature ?
@DailyCaller The pipsqueak Iranian military needs to learn a hard lesson with BODDA Bing BODDA BOOOM - how about some precision surgical strikes to chop snake heads?
@CatoInstitute Too bad American celebrities and radical lefties have not LEFT &amp; taken advantage of their opportunities in Venezuela. They are socialist heroes &amp; missing out on a glorious mission. The mass exodus by Venezuelan citizens need replacing with elites...
@DineshDSouza Funny how radical liberals have hijacked the democrat party &amp; are " all over the place" trying to rewrite &amp; ignore the truth of history. Now more " truth" that isn't the truth !
@tgradous @FDRLST Those who don't believe in the Constitution will &amp; are subverting the Constitution as we witness deep burrowers &amp; those who are very much on the surface - WORMS - D.C. is very wormy
@tgradous @JoePCunningham @RedState Grudges can be a two way street chicken &amp; egg kinda thing but chickens &amp; eggs don't do well on a road - or something like that ?
@journo_star Good thing Pres. Trump has made NATO countries add their fair share by strengthening their own militaries and not sucking off Americans as much. Some people have a perverse fantasy fascination with wanting to suck off Pres. Trump
@guardian The Guardian has it right by not want a blue wave- but the red, white AND blue has the connotation of the American flag waving in the breeze. Thank you Guardian...
@thehill The democrat leadership advocating violence, the resistance to Constitutional rule &amp; Brennan's calling for blood to be spilling in the streets is seditious evil effecting feeble minds &amp; will precipitate more shootings by more lunatics
@thehill The U.S. has a radical leftist democrat mental health problem. Faith in the original intent of the Constitution &amp; the wisdom of the founding fathers is severely lacking in Neo democrats &amp; has effected their well being. Their neurosis is at a CRITICAL MASS !
@JudicialWatch @JBaker31826004 When will Hillary move up the road from Chappaqua to the Bedford N Y Federal Facility ?They have a suite in reserve ...
@ChuckCallesto Kathy Griffin needs to take a long vacation &amp; flit around in her short skirt with no undies in the south side of Chicago. The thing is she would like it &amp; it could be a HOLE new gig for her female parts.
@thehill It's a shame McCain did not become President in 08 because he wasn't a snake 🐍 Now we have how many residual serpents slithering around ready to bite or squeeze you to death...👹👺
@Cernovich The mentality of D-K type Hillary people is truly nauseating &amp; they think they are elite ? No wonder she is a two time loser...
@JudicialWatch Interesting the history of the Damocles Sword &amp; crooked people in power. What is that anyway? Could make for a great country western song - anybody?
@FoxBusiness @JeffFlock It's a shame all that community organizing ( socialism monkey business) has only led to the worst economic disaster in the history of Chicago ( $28 billion behind the 🎱) ???!!!
@PatrioticVa @jim_fowlds @POTUS @gatewaypundit It's a shame McCain didn't become President in 08 because he was not a snake 🐍 &amp; now we have a bunch of residual serpents slithering around ready to bite you or squeeze you to death with the help of neo non journalists...
@FoxNews @dbongino Lurch has to go one way or another. What is a Damocles sword?
@BreitbartNews Vile radical democrats automatically rush to politicize lunatics that are often embarrassingly loony leftist radicals...the dog ate their homework ...
@JudicialWatch It's so handy for Comey cause the Danbury " Facility " is so close to Westport Ct. Just follow Rt.7 &amp; bingo ( clunk clank clink )
@thehill It's a shame McCain didn't become President in 08 because he was not a snake 🐍 Unfortunately there are residual serpents deeply entrenched. Some are poisonous like cobras &amp; rattlers others will crush you to like Burmese pythons,anacondas, &amp; boa constrictors.
@Imamofpeace So many people don't know the difference between radical Islamic extremists &amp; conventional modern day Muslims. Like with some Christian sects there are extremes but Christians &amp; Jews don't slaughter people on a massive scale.
@BreitbartNews Rosie O'Donnell's body guard/ chauffeur was arrested in Greenwich Ct. a few years back on school grounds for carrying an illegal concealed .357 magnum pistol &amp; no legal carry permit or license. CELEBRITY HYPOCRITE !!!
@thehill So many deadly serpents left over still crawling around in plain sight. Some are poisonous others are constrictors.
@thehill It's a shame McCain didn't become President in '08 because he was not a snake 🐍
@thehill The founding fathers predicted such possibilities, hence the 1st &amp; 2nd amendments &amp; protection afforded  from totalitarian states.
@thehill It's a shame McCain didn't become President because he wasn't a snake 🐍 So many serpents, politicized FBI &amp; CIA were all guaranteed positions of power in a planned democrat totalitarian take over by so called elites. They can go pound sand !
@BreitbartNews Hillary should be testing the Bedford Federal Facility just up the road from Chappaqua. They are saving a suite for her.
@trumpovic02 @ChrisMo37540912 Did he promise them health care too?
@Heritage Poor Iranian leaders have gone through Obamas pay for play $1.5 billion U S cash. Did they help him out with a Swiss bank account?
@Heritage Democrat socialists can not win arguments with economic historians so they pivot, squirm &amp; avoid such discussions in a dishonest manner. They are just so use to extorting other people's money &amp; creating more government jobs that suck off working taxpayers.
@WayneDupreeShow Obvious there is a 2X standard for foul mouth radical Jihadi democrats advocating violence &amp; blood in the streets compared to honest down to earth Patriotic American Citizens &amp; lovers of the U S Constitution
@politico It's a shame McCain didn't win the Presidency because he was not a snake 🐍 in the grass - Unlike a self confessed former drug dealer...
@LibsAreInsane @sdv92 @jstines3 @DrSueDVM @jack @POTUS @Feisty_FL @ChristieC733 @Braveheart_USA @GaetaSusan @sunbeltgirl @DataGenesis @NascarChuck336 @ShotsRangOut Thank God &amp; our forefathers for the 1st &amp; 2nd amendments that the radical leftist Jihadi democrats are trying to squash !
@LibsAreInsane @sdv92 @jstines3 @DrSueDVM @jack @POTUS @Feisty_FL @ChristieC733 @Braveheart_USA @GaetaSusan @sunbeltgirl @DataGenesis @NascarChuck336 @ShotsRangOut Neo Democrat Socialists can't win their war against logic &amp; reality but they try with the most foul language &amp; threats of violence - as Brennan calls for blood in the streets...
@thehill From the get go the FBI &amp; CIA knew there was no ( crime) there there. How now Brown cow ? There there there is just a bunch of bellowing cows with bags of sour milk
@bud_cann @ChrisMo37540912 Wacky Steven Taylor has a bio chemistry imbalance that affects his mental capacity- evidence of frontal lobe damage. Sad -
@ChicotheCanine @rial_rocks @kathygriffin It is self evident Kathy Griffin &amp; enablers are very sick individuals. There actions speak louder than words but their words are most foul &amp; illustrate their status as domestic enemies. 👹👺
@LauraLoomer @MSNBC @MalcolmNance Democrats have combined forces with radical Jihadi Islamists to subvert the U.S.Constitution. Thank God for the 1st &amp; 2nd amendment. Along with democrats call for violence Brennan could be right about his threat of blood in the streets.
@JudicialWatch Brennan,Crapper,Comey,Strzok,Mueller &amp; cohorts are all in board to cover for the Pakistani DNC I.T. SPY SPECIALIST perpetrating probably the largest release of TOP SECRET GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS in the history of the U.S.A. - TRAITORS &amp; TREASON !!!
@BreitbartNews Swalwell claims to be an attorney &amp; doesn't realize there has to be a crime to indite somebody. There's no proof Trump committed any type of crime &amp; nothing 1/2 of Hollywood doesn't participate. Swalwell just wants attention &amp; he easily gets pissy...
@JudicialWatch Mueller,Crapper,Comey,Brennan &amp; cohorts are all on board for Hillary's numb skull Email &amp; unsecured servers being hacked by Russia,China,North Korea, Iran,Pakistan,Afghanistan,Syria &amp; those darn Macedonians. In effect they aid &amp; abet our enemies TRAITORS !
@Karen88775 @ChrisMo37540912 This guy qualifies as a good mascot for democrat socialists but he proves ignorance is not bliss- PATHETIC !
@LauraLoomer @realDonaldTrump It's a shame McCain didn't become Pres. after the 1st 4 because he was not a snake 🐍
@FoxNews @SenJohnMcCain It's a shame McCain didn't become Pres. because he was not a snake 🐍.
@Ted_Just_Ted @mitchellvii Why don't you move to Germany or England &amp; suck up to a radical Islamist - stick your neck out &amp; do the world a favor !
@Ted_Just_Ted @Mike_Beacham Looks like you like criminal human/child trafficking. Do you prefer little boys or little girls from south of the border? Unfortunately there are thousands of perps. like you &amp; thousands of kids disappear all over the U.S. How many have you had?
@seanmdav It's a shame John McCain did not become President because he was not a snake 🐍
@thehill Too bad John McCain didn't become President because he was not a snake 🐍
@FoxNews Killer Ted conspired with the USSR to subvert President Reagan &amp; he was proud of doing it after former Pres.Reagan's death. Too bad about Ted's brain ...
@FoxNews Wonder if Ted Kennedy met up with Mary Joe's spirit &amp; what transpired ?
@TIME It's a shame John McCain did not become President because he was not a snake 🐍
@thehill It's a shame John McCain didn't become President because he was not a snake 🐍
@thehill It's a shame John McCain didn't become President cause he was not a snake 🐍
@TracyAChambers @BreitbartNews It's a shame John McCain didn't become Preident cause wasn't a 🐍
@DineshDSouza @StephenKing It's a shame McCain didn't become President cause wasn't a serpent !
@thehill Does Mueller have a sword of Damocles hanging nearby overhead &amp; not know it ?
@StumpforTrump @ChrisMo37540912 Sessions looks more mouse like than sewer or swamp rat 🐁🐀
@thehill What about BIDEN'S CHINA SYNDROME ???
@LauraLoomer Yes so many privileged super luminaries have dropped the ball &amp; only pay lip service to the plight of V A victims &amp; guinea pigs. The Washington elite all have &amp; receive the best medical care in the entire world &amp; are far " removed "!
@thehill Sen.McCain WAS a genuine hero but like all of us mortals he was not perfect especially as a RINO. Of course he served his country as best he could beyond what most reading this have...
@unscriptedmike @t2gunner The pathological main stream media creatures are more sympathetic to illegal alien killers than than victims friends &amp; families. PARASITES!
@JohnKStahlUSA @t2gunner Is it possible Comey, Brennan &amp; Crapper all have brain tumors ? They seem so " twilight zone " compared to the founding fathers .
@Cernovich Is it becoming self evident many radical democrats are pathological sociopaths seeking a violent overthrow/coup ? Is their " powder dry" cause there just so many self absorbed weenies involved ? ( meaning talcum) Watch them wet their pants 🤣😷
@thehill Is it possible Barry is a XXX type?
@Mike_Beacham Is it possible Mueller might be subject to a Sword of Damocles &amp; does not know what is in the future considering his over confidant arrogance ???
@AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO Andrew Weinstein is just another spewer of mis/dis information Obama lackey.
@thehill It will be very interesting to see how history views Lurch cause the guy is just so so so what can you say that can be repeated in polite company?!
@IancuVladim How dare anyone challenge the democrat right of self justification no matter how bad they screw things up because their hearts are in the right place for the final solution by hook or by crook.
@BreitbartNews Rahm Emanuel has his own special form of population control &amp; it's been pretty effective especially on the weekends. I don't understand why the Chicago 👮🏾 Police get so upset cause Obama was also pretty effective &amp; initiated the " reforms"
@marklutchman @JBaker31826004 Hopefully Matt Damon we'll stick his neck out diligently when he meets a radical Islamic camel thief otherwise it would prove he's racist.
@haggerskme Trans men don't menstruate don't have eggs, can't become pregnant &amp; trans. women don't have testicles, prostate gland or sperm. Chromosomes say it all &amp; there are only two sexes. Prove science wrong? You can't!
@BreitbartNews https://t.co/UNAA7rarj0 is almost as smart as Maxine &amp; that is saying something !
@ACLJ Demonic Neo democrat socialists believe abortion is their right not unlike satanic cults that have secret ritual baby &amp; animal sacrifices. Their wickedness knows no bounds like Planned Parenthood selling wholly formed human baby parts for " science "
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @realDonaldTrump Dinesh De Souza has revealed the Nazi National Socialism &amp; Communist Socialism meet each other full circle with their history of death &amp; destruction. Neo socialists have no sense of history or reality. They are the essence of neo democrats/Antifa goons.
@bud_cann @ChrisMo37540912 The special needs stick boy needs attention and is running around with stealthy armed security trying to scare up money making gigs...
@bud_cann @ChrisMo37540912 Minnesota is just one testing ground to see how far radical Islam can go in the U.S.A. Good luck Minnesota!
@PhilMcCrackin44 @ChrisMo37540912 Are they called house dresses cause they are that big ? When you have dealt with a lot of pork ( other people's money) some of it must have rubbed off...
@consrvatvebammr @ChrisMo37540912 The only jobs radical leftist liberal democrat socialists ever create are state &amp; federal government jobs that suck off the tax payers tits.
@thehill Political " insiders " in both parties have been going nuts cause they've never dealt with a non politician that sees thru there games, big &amp; little self-ingratiating scams &amp; grifter deals. Trump has had to pay them all off in times past - no more !
@thehill The not so special counsel is getting desperate to go beyond trying to indite more than  ham sandwiches cause Pres. Trump hasn't done anything with criminal intent or broken any laws. There will be a double reversal in the works soon...
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Spell check changed Maher who needs changing !
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Magee &amp; Brennan are to be two pees in a pod getting cooked in the democrat stew 🐀
@newsbusters @Italians4Trump The same NYT gnome trolls who soft peddled the Boston Marathon Bombers are continuing their evil ways with the buttress ing of the illegal alien animal who knifed Mollie Tibbets to death. What darkness dwells in their hearts to sell their souls ?
@Zippityd00dah @ChrisMo37540912 All sorts of deep state XX floating around D C trying to subvert the original intent of the U S Constitution. The ALL SEEING EYE  &amp;  DEVINE PROVIDENCE will be the FINAL SOLUTION to their deceitful actions &amp; souls !
@RealOmarNavarro @steph93065 Go Omar go &amp; get the old witch outta there. She's way past her prime &amp; everything is sliding down hill into the gutter with Maxine's call for democrat violence against conservatives.
@chuckwoolery With the rapid advance in technology F B &amp; Twatter could go the way of the dodo bird.
@JudicialWatch The honorable scandal free U S Marshals should take over leadership of the highly conflicted politicized &amp; discredited leaders of the FBI. Seems like the recent FBI leadership was heading towards &amp; advocating a democrat totalitarian state.
