My personal opinion truly is at the other end of the spectrum of anti-VAX or‘s.	My grandkids all have never had Measles Mumps Rubella, or Chickenpox. Due to vaccines. Their immune systems are good. The grades are great! I think of my dead niece often as my grands approach her age
@warriormama1019  Polio vaccine was not around for my uncle. His life was anything but normal,early death. 	Also my brother’s 9 year old symptoms  were bad headaches, vomit, high fever. Our Dad an MD put her in 2 dayhosp she died from meningitis pneumococcus in 4 days. 🚫Vaccines
