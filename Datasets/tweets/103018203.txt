@musicmakinmama Hi Karla, What a cool find!! Burry was a licensed baker of Girl Scout Cookies and Chocolate Chip was produced in the 1970s.
@amywilson Each Girl Scout council chooses a licensed baker, either ABC Bakers or Little Brownie Bakers. Each baker uses different names for some cookies. The two cookies look and taste similar, but the name of the cookie and the recipe are dependent on the baker. We hope that helps!
