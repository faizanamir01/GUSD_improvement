@MissUniverse 1996.. Yes I am extroverted, funny and optimistic but must very real not fake person. I always say what my heart said and speak out what is true, I never cover things that are wrong, I always like the truth comes out either bad or good. I'm very realistic. https://t.co/Voq529ejnr

It's not easy being rejected and don't value you. God knows how it felts and the feeling of hurts inside you that you can't explane. My fear to hurt anybody makes me a losser I think, and everytime I care I'm always hurt and dissapointed.But I still thankful I have good heart.
Some dont think they will hurt someone who care for them  &amp; value .They just think there own goodness &amp; maybe it's a selfish way. Hope, you will value person who long to be w/ you &amp; think how it hurts. Not using but treasure a person who come &amp; want to stay w/ you.

How can I fight this,Cibophobia?	HELP!!Everytime I think about food, it seems like I will be big &amp; I don't feel hungry cause Im afraid.Maybe one reason I'm like this cause nobody in courage me to eat &amp; Im always alone.I forget to eat most of the day. &amp; I always monitor my weight. https://t.co/cSVmq0JR6r
Love is sacrifice, make someone happy not in material way. Love is God &amp; even it hurts you &amp; not giving you all material needs if it's pure from your heart you can sacrifice for the sake of his happiness. Maybe now a days real  love doesn't exist cause some people define that way
I ask a friend of mine how she define love? It was a shocking, how she define it. For her love is if someone give you all your needs,she mean in materials needs. 😱😱If someone can provide she will love him.😱😱 Divastating how he mean by love.. Love for me is sacrifice to other
I hope a have shoulder to cry on. My heart is deeply crying, need a hug	need a care but nobody I can lean on😪		https://t.co/R2NoMrJwuA
I treasure our moments together and I'm a type of woman who love heart not wallet. Maybe I'm a old fashion but I always value heart and	as together... If you value a person you will search for her and be with cause every single with her means a lot.😥😪
Sometimes a person just take you for granted and no empathy. So painfull why not all cares and think you may hurt other person. It so divastating, you care so much but 	your still worthless. Hurtful,,, so hurtfull
It still doesn't matter to you?	I got so far but im still worthless. 		https://t.co/oo4qAwZ5EP
Try so hard and doing your best to let you see I'm real good  person but it the end you still worthless and doesn't mean all your effort😭		https://t.co/6TWkPwLfU5
It's so hurtful, even how good your intention to someone but his intention is to hurt you. And you don't know we're you stand in his life .Even your real, but still not enough and continue not giving you worth and intend to hurt you, lie. 	I'm tired, it so devastating feeling.

If U care so much U hurt so much. If your doing good in returned just hurt you. U give time but there time not for you. U respect but they think your like a robbot don't have feelings. Is it hurtful.U  try your very best &amp; understand everything but your still  have no value.😢
People  sometimes are so cruel	Even you do all good for him or her in return you will be hurt, I wish I know how to be cruel &amp; fake. But I love God and I'm afraid to hurt anybody. Some  people don't see that? Sometime, so blind and self center. So heartful 😢
Caring someone who doesn't even care for you hurt so much, even how real you are it doesn't  mean to him. It's better to care as long you did not do bad again anybody. https://t.co/r0YZ4NFiY4

If people don't appreciate your care maybe there freaking heartless. And there used to appreciate people with no heart. https://t.co/JB2Hji3LGK
If a person won't take effort to be with you, don't push cause it will just  hurt you more. If your in a mind and feel good with you?He will do best to have you.. It's painful to show more care but on his side your nothing. As long your doing good, God will be there for you.

You don't know how it's killing me thinking I'm on a strange country, different culture &amp; not celebrating Christmas. I Keep watching medias who friends and family get together, I can't hold my tears , thinking I'm alone &amp; I pity my self sacrifice always for love ones, alone.

@nypost It should be on other pageant, not in miss universe.its not good image
@nypost I thought Miss Universe critiria are female? I think this is the first time man femenize join the contest. I am afraid in the future, the old realistic pageant will be all man femenize. It should be same like before all real woman.. Spain has no other real beautiful woman?
@Alex_zedra Wow, so nice.. Can I have a try? I love guns

As long I'm doing good, I know God will protect me... It so hard to find real genuine person now a days. Some just after of personal need and don't treasure feelings. If have find one,really  value and show real care. It's so hard to find a person like this. Hope his around😔 https://t.co/xtimHI3vAK
Life is boring, even thou all you have to do is show your nice smile &amp; go on with the days. It's like river flowing, just go on with the flow until your breath end. Life is so tirefull alone &amp; no one is real beside you,to talk &amp; real care Standing strong but  deep inside lonely. https://t.co/WN7RYQZGuF
It's difficult sometimes being the only femenize in the group,you need to be more stronger and open minded. And most all your judgment must be fair and strong decision for the good outcome.	But I take everyday as a challenge for a better me, by Grace of God.
I'm not asking you to believe on this movie but as the holy Bible said on chapter revelation for the seven angel bringing seven trumpet. It's your faith to decide	It's on you to judge  I don't believe in religion. I believe there is God.God bless you all		https://t.co/Uu6gYPXWXk
It will be  another sad Christmas for me. Away from home, alone and need care. It's OK as long all the people I love will be happy sending my hardship , I will sacrifice and continue to serve them. Merry Christmas in advance.
Its not my  lost if a person don't care my presence as long God knows I'm doing good and not aim to hurt anybody. Being real sometimes hurts, I just pray to God those who hurt me will be bless and have goodness in there heart... I will always stay good pure ❤️heart https://t.co/0tLLR5Aiiw
@thecjpearson 😢
Don't push someone to be with you	Don't push someone  to appreciate your presence and let him like you cause in the end you will be hurt.	Let it go, if just hurting you and don't care about your feelings. Love yourself and walk away for your best.

Nothing is so wonderful than being Real to anybody. No need fake mash and act like a joker in front of anybody... Simply being REAL is nothing to hide and show the purity of heart.. Practise that... Be pure, be real good... https://t.co/n5pxQ4Rjqd
I always express  what my heart felt and said my mind think. I don't care if you think I'm over reacting as long I delivered what I felt and I am Real.	So if hates I don't care as long I'm doing good &amp; not harm anybody.	I hate people who act there good &amp; showing they care but not
I erase person in my life who are fake &amp; pretend good in front of me. Sorry but you don't know my ability to read the gesture of a person. Thanks God, I don't know how to become fake to anybody.	That's  the hates, person I dare not to incounter cause I know how crazy I am😠😠😠
There are really man, woman who are  fake. AND two faces, maybe  thinking  Im not same his or her nationality I can't  understand his/her  language. Thanks God I can still read it even you wrote on your alphabite. SO for the fake person there?? Don't be so over acting. I hate it!
@JackPosobiec Can they not do it in democratic way. WHY? Destroying other property to show what your fighting for doesn't  mean it's good enough. There are peacefull way to resolve some issues.

@charliekirk11 O!!! That's not good, bonafide residence must take action, specially on government position.Once a country i rule mostly by foreign occupant sure culture and other things well slowly change.
@kira_isabella Nice idea
@RaymondArroyo He was the best singer, Frank Sinatra is one of a kind, nobody can duplicate his style to singing and his voice "Wow"
@realDonaldTrump We must follow laws even not a citizen at that country , .Be a good abiding foreign occupant, We must respect each other culture, For me its a good decision, everybody has right to upgrade and stand firmly on his decision.
Some woman are afraid to fight what's on there mind, rights? Take me differently cause I stand what on my mind &amp; I speak what is better.I'm not afraid to argue people who are  short minded &amp; one sided  in life. My pain?I use it to stand strong,I embrace &amp; choice to be different
Don't treat all people same on your practise &amp; culture.We are different. I am very open minded person &amp; I respect other practise.I speak what my heart said &amp; a very  frank person , I don't hide things to make argument in the future.For me fake people are very big "Bullshit" https://t.co/Sgy7lz2ybj

Treat me good and I treat you more good than you done to me.
Someone who give time for me means a lot to me.I value time, care, and real person more than  money.	Geniuty of person with sense of humour that's exactly I like.
God know's I am Real and praying I well meet that person someday but I'm tired of waiting and seems it well not happen.
Is hurtfull after he just make you feel your worthless &amp; nothing after all you have done.I don't believe any feelings anymore at least if someone I see who is sencire &amp; real but maybe that's impossible.That person never born to face my challenges.
Being Real? Maybe I believe someone if I see a person who really genuine on his feeling and can present me to public who I am to him. Now a days that very hard to find, &amp; what I saw nobodies real.All just after what they need and disappear &amp; make stories.Being Real to someone
Sincerity?It may be seen by his action &amp; the way he show how much you meant to him.I don't believe in any words cause from what I been it learned me a lesson	"it's hard to trust someone" .Even how good you show &amp;care in the end they well hurt you after all your care &amp; being real.
If a person has free time or days 	but can't be with you? Either his with other person &amp; your not important to him.He may make many excuses to make you believe things are good. For me giving time &amp; with someone you care value me a lot it show how sincerity.

https://t.co/oXesiVv4ER		Sometimes, we did not see someone there care for as without expecting in return, but we are to blind to see how lucky we have this person. Some of as just take for granted after we get what we want. It's hurtful to feel but it's real to some.
GOD, see my heart.	For  hurts I have, I never put hatred on my heart but I bless the person for God knows what's in my heart.		https://t.co/MkabC1mM0d
In returned you will just be hurt &amp; never expect it just like that. I always put may heart for something I do  for someone cause I know what God said being good &amp; pure intention best count on Him. I'm afraid to play others feeling, for me feeling is holy &amp; only God can create it.
Their are people who come into our life even how good we treat them, we give our best to support and help them but sad to say it's not enough.Showing care is not all in finincial aspect in life, what little thing that do purely from heart, I treasure most. Buttttttt 	In returned

Don't allow your illness or pain on your body control you. But allow your brain to control the pain in you. Some illness depend on how you deal on it. Challenge the pain on your body and defeat it by your   positive thought.
❤️My Lord, please prepare my heart for what is about to come. Make me stronger as I never expect who  I am. Be my frontage, be in me for what is called battle of life, you know more than my heart and what  I can do. Please prepare me. I trust you,O! God, Amen. 🙏
Faith and Patience drive you into action. That one day you will rise, No matter what physical body size you have but what make you powerful is you believe in yourself and you have power on your heart to do what you want. Faith in you motivates your power to grow.
Isn't wonderful? No griveness and cruelty in our heart. And as what	we feel, we show and share to make others happy?But we can't define others to do so cause we have different culture &amp; belief but in you universal called life we must, as human being  &amp; as child  of God.
Some may not see that cruelness is not only by  slapping other face,ending other life, etc. but also not being real to others. I keep thinking why other people can't be real? And life may more wonderful if all is being real, frank and show by there good heart.
better person.Forgiveness is not for other but for yourself . Don't let them define you on your past, but let define you as a whole you.Make  your past your  challenge and show your power to attain a better person.Your the captain of your destiny. And the power is in you.
Some people may done wicked &amp; cruel in you. Don't hold on, unto it. The best punishment you can give is to move on and be happy. Don't allow any single second more of your life to control you. Move on and don't hold your   past but make use it to  mold, shape  and make you a

私は完璧ではないかもしれませんが、私は本当です...
It's not easy in this cruel world that your hoping everybody  real and good intention as you. Sometimes I tell God I'm not belong here I'm so real and I speak what on my  mind and heart.
I'm not a stone, that in times you like to use it will not break down.	I have a good heart who never pretend and act to be real but being real to me is natural .	You may see me strong standing but I'm breaking down when I'm alone. GOD knows I have good hearts and
But God knows me more than you.	HE knows I'm real and good. Surely	a good deeds and heart have more favor in GOD's eyes.
If  you don't appreciate the things I have done to you and makes you feel annoying don't worry I'm also like you, human and get tired to prove my worth. It will not easy to move on but I know God will help	me overcome. When your real it hurts but if your fake it's easy.
How I wish someone will value me and make me important in his life. How I wish someone is there for  me, up and down and afraid I get tired showing my care and appreciation to him....................	But this maybe hard to find???😔
Don't force anybody to care for you	If he do? Must be real and not your  hoping he will. Sometimes when you do things that show how important a person he is for you can't be seen and not appreciated.	And your hoping in return he will do same for you.

and your intention are good.	So always be real from your heart and stand different from the others,don't follow the crowd...It's good to be real ❤ and  nice being  different👍
I like to achieve something that when people read my name with RIP  they well remember me someone who care and real.	When I care to someone I really do cause I'm not a fake person.I always ask myself why some people can't be real,it so easy and more easy if your heart is pure
Although my mom and I have some argument but I always tie on my neck to respect her and never speak back bad words ,she knows that.	I love my mother so much and I hope someday she well read this	to let her know how thankful I am she there for me..I love you mama	GOD Bless you...
She continue travel and build more business as she could.And I'm so thankful she's a business minded  and hard working,mother.I learned a lot and I follow a strong woman like her  to support myself and kids.I thank,God  for giving me a mother like her.
Business is business let's follow what the rules are.Friends are friends but if it comes to business all must be properly treated equally,no friend and no family.☺	That's  one thing I learned  not from school but from my mother who until now at age of 67years old
