@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Wow, not to say that I’m surprised, but the fact that you had all night to provide even an iota of Palestinian control of the land or even an existence of such a people, and were unable to do so is extremely disappointing. Thank you.
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Wanna keep ignoring the truth? Tell me about the Palestinian leaders pre Arafat, tell me about the history of the Palestinian people, tell me about a time when these people were a recognized nation, evidence of coinage, government, art &amp; culture. Come on...😂😂
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Just name a single Palestinian leader prior to Arafat. Tell me where it’s seat of government has been. Tell me why numerous civilaztions have never spoken of the Palestinian people but the Jews are mentioned throughout history. Where is your archaeological support?
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Still no evidence? Lol. You really should stop responding. You are given opportunities to provide evidence in support of your narrative and you don’t. Your lies remain to exist as truth only in your mind and not in reality. But please continue lol
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Ah you can’t argue with me because you know you can’t provide even a single shred of evidence. If truth was on your side you’d present it but you can’t. You’re pathetic.
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Just provide be with a single shrewd of Palestinian archaeological evidence that reflects the modern day Palestinian. Just 1. Or tell me about a single Palestinian leader prior to Arafat. So yes, you are dense.
@BJPsez @kylegriffin1 @JeffMerkley You forgot that Obama put children in cages?
@kylegriffin1 $5 billion is NOT a lot of money for the USA government. This guy is a liar.
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Are you dense?
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon There were no Palestinians until 67. “Palestine” is a British term that derives it’s name from the Roman term “Palestina” which was the name the Romans gave to the Jewish land it occupied/conquered.
@rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon What occupation? If you’re a real Jew, you’ll support the fact that the land west of the Jordan is israel. If not, then tell me when a Palestinian state has ever existed.

@AG_Conservative But many nations oppose this because their leadership hasn’t been decimated like in other nations.
@AG_Conservative We’d have to continue military presence in those nations for as long as we have in European nations and japan. It’s fairly obvious that nations tend to do better when they don’t have to worry about their security, the USA provides that and others thrive.
@AG_Conservative The reality is that no country is less safe when the USA leaves. There’s no way we can control what happens in a foreign state when we aren’t present the same way as if we are present. Whenever we leave, most nations will go backwards not forwards.

@bungarsargon Trump has been far better for Israel than Obama. There’s no argument. From recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, moving the embassy there and standing up against anti-semites at the UN. It’s not even debatable. Obama let Iran into Syria and funded their terrorism.

@haydaa54552996 @ianbremmer The population of Gaza has grown faster than any other Arab people, once Hamas is removed there should be peace. Hamas is awful, the people aren’t ironically they are also some of the most obese in the Middle East.
@haydaa54552996 @ianbremmer Israel occupies nobody, in fact Judea and Samaria, West Bank, should be part of israel. Same with parts of Jordan if we really want to go to biblical time. But I’ll tolerate that israel isn’t whole.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr Cool. There’s been no need. How many times are you going to run the same argument and continuously prove that you’re a fear mongerer? Has Trump shut down this investigation once over the last 20 months? No. Thought not. Now resign in disgrace.
@haydaa54552996 @ianbremmer If you’re comparing Israel, which defends its citizens vs Arab states that kill their own citizens you should kindly leave this conversation. Israel can destroy Gaza and West Bank in a single night, but shows restraint as Fatah pays martyrs to kill Israelis and Gaza bombs Israel.
@AndrewFeinberg It can always work better
@haydaa54552996 @ianbremmer No, I think your brain is fried. The Arab nations get away with bloody murder and inhumane treatment everyday and no one bats an eye because there are 58 Muslim majority nations and they are a massive voting block at the UN, connected by religious ideology.

@MarkTreitel @DanielBShapiro It’s not good for Israel as it’s an obvious capitulation to Erdogan. And if Obama pulled this boneheaded move I’d be just as angry. Doesn’t change the fact that Trump has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, kept his promise to move the embassy there, and acts at UN.
@DanielBShapiro I agree with your first sentence Amb. but let’s not pretend that the Obama admin did far more for Erdogan, Putin and Khameni than Trump’s done. This move by Trump is idiotic.

@NumbersMean @stmilonyc @BillKristol I can’t tell if you’re trolling or not. If the gdp growth over 4 separate quarters exceeds 3% than the annual growth will also exceed 3%
@NumbersMean @stmilonyc @BillKristol Yes, through 3 quarters GDP growth in the USA is 3.3%. If you multiply that times 3 you get 9.9%, which requires 2.1% Q4 growth to get 12% added totals and divided by 4 you get 3%.

@Serendipity7845 @RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump It seems like you’re ignoring how WW2  and why it ended. It was because of Russia and the USA.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump While I agree, it’s too bad European nations are still quite anti-Semitic, and I’d consider anti-semitism to be evil.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump The Battle of Britain was a defensive action by the British against the Germans. I asked about offensives...
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump So educate me on the great British offensives that turned the tide of war. And then after we discuss those let’s compare them to American and Russian offensives, and the impact those had.
@Heathcoatman @RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump I have to say the same thing about you.
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump I never said I don’t appreciate the sacrifices of all people, I do expect us to assess each nation’s sacrifices and contributions honestly.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Which is why I said the English.
@Minimadden @RugbyTerrier @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Did I offend you that you decided to move from having a substantive discussion to a sort of ad hominem attack? I was enjoying this but you made me realize I had too high of an expectation for your ability to be civil and discuss substance. You’re now blocked have a nice day.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump You realize Dunkirk was an EVACUATION not an offensive? This indicates retreat. Tell me how you win a war by retreating.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Sure, but most troops who fought in WW2 that were British were English than they were welsh, Irish, or Scottish.
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump The truth hurts, maybe you should be less sensitive, and be more honest that it was the USA and Russia that protected Europe and defeated the Nazis. I’m not going to coddle your emotions.
@Heathcoatman @RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump No, England was defending itself from being taken over. They weren’t mounting an offensive, they did not come to France’s aid...
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Britain didn’t lead the charge, they defended their homeland. And the German blitzkreig destroyed London. It was the USA Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe.
@Minimadden No I do not think so. We’ve had so many wars since the end of world war 2, even in Europe, such as in the balkans, Yugoslavia, Chechnya, as well as Korea, Vietnam, numerous wars in Africa, etc.
@lcsboyz @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Your naivety on the subject would be better appreciated somewhere else. Your superficial analysis should not enter this conversation. You are now blocked.
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump To what degree though? I agree they had a “hand” in defeating fascism I’d hardly consider those nations to be the nation’s which led the charge, like the USA did, as well as Russia.
@Minimadden I’d hardly consider this to be short sighted because in order to look into the future you need to remember how we got here.
@Minimadden Well the USA is very well protected due to geopolitics and our military. We have no duty to defend others, even though we do. And I’d say it’s european selfishness that has led to this moment, and Trump is the first President to address these issues.
@Minimadden And of course I am referring to legal migration refugee/asylum seekers and not illegal migration such as what we’ve seen from Northern Africa/sahal region into Spain, Greece, Italy, and Turkey.
@Minimadden I’ve looked it up. The USA accepts over 85% of the world’s refugees that are in fact admitted to their host nation. Obviously the migration due to Syria and the Arab spring/winter changed that, but consistently what I say has been the truth since end of WW2.
@Minimadden I don’t think it’s our job to protect other wealthy nations. Trump knows, as do they, that they have the ability to protect themselves, and instead they prioritize their spending in other areas. Not to mention European nations lack morals and are among the most corrupt.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Not to mention the USA is the only nation which contributes as much aid to the rest of the world and accepts more refugees per year than the rest of the world combined. Oh and we assert ourselves and come to the defense of many nations around the world, whereas EU doesn’t.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump I see it more that he’s asserting American leadership and letting the world know that he understands our place in the world and our leverage. We represent 26% of the world’s GDP, less than 1/25th of the population, and have the world’s largest military, by far.
@zeus6793 @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump How do you figure we are saying fuck you? You want to continue to contribute your hard earned tax dollars after working 40+ hour weeks with 10 vacation days a year when most Europeans work 35 hours a week and have 41 vacation days a year?

@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Why shouldn’t Trump hold them accountable? Also how do you define “an attack?” Maybe I’m less sensitive than you are but criticism is warranted when we hold people accountable. Not to mention all these individuals are adults, they should be able to deal with criticism.
@WalshFreedom If they acted as Acosta does, absolutely. Instead the media was full of relatives of Obama admin staff, for instance CBS President was David Rhodes, who is Ben Rhodes’ brother, or “journalists” who fawned over Obama.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump If you think about WW 2, France capitulated in a matter of weeks if not months, because they did invest in military. And then it was us, the USA, along with Russia that defeated the Nazis and saved Europe from the Nazis. It certainly wasn’t the Vichy government.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Totally agree, which European nations realize they NEED USA. That’s why it makes little sense to me that they would be so disrespectful and not contribute to their own defense. Instead we protect them. And obviously their mindset when it comes to work and taxes is at issue.

@spopslee @McFaul That’s not true. We just disagree with what the democrats believe are acts of patriotism, issues of national security and the role of the military. Your narrow view blinds you from differentiating opinions from facts.
@McFaul @Acosta He is an opinion columnist. As are all the people who appear on cable news. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that most news has become political punditry and not reporting facts.

@edfischman @McFaul Honestly, my issue is with how democrats have made this a binary decision. If I don’t support the Paris Accords I’m against protecting our environment...that’s ridiculous. I just tend to think there are better ways from what is a political agreement.
@McLovinSJ @McFaul You’re not very bright and your lack of an ability to have civil and substantive conversation has led to the conclusion of our dialogue. Have a nice day.
@edfischman @McFaul It’s obvious that oil and gas are far cheaper than renewables, and yet this planet suffers to provide all of humanity with hot water and air conditioning, so before you want to be efficient and provide for all you want to move to address another issue. That doesn’t sound logical.
@edfischman @McFaul I’m not advocating “doing nothing,” I’m advocating pragmatism. And the Paris Accords are neither binding on each nation nor enforceable by a governing body. Have you read the accords?
@edfischman @McFaul My mind is on the here and now first and foremost. I don’t like the terrible conditions that billions live in today. They will continue to suffer as will their progeny if we lack pragmatism to address their current energy needs.
@edfischman @McFaul I’ve never advocated for the destruction of humanity, I advocate for consideration of people in the developing world. Let’s be honest, most of those people already lack access to air conditioning, hot water, etc. which we in America and he developed world take for granted.
@edfischman @McFaul We can have serious discussions about protecting our environment, that  doesn’t deny the billions of people in the developing world of a chance at a better life. Renewables are the FUTURE, when the technology catches up to it.
@edfischman @McFaul I’m totally in support of rebuilding our forests. Specifically in Brazil where we have decimated the Amazon. However, there are millions of Brazilians who suffer from extreme poverty. So we can rebuild the forests and let many live in squalid conditions.
@edfischman @McFaul I disagree with your argument, given the lack of scientific tools and a written record concerning the deterioration of forests, as well as numerous other environmental indicators of which we’ve only been able to record over the last 50-100 years.
@edfischman @McFaul Even 100,000 years out of a history of 4.5 billion is a blip. Your argument wants to punish the poorest people in the world, you want to make their lives more difficult to protect the wealth of the most developed nations.
@edfischman @McFaul So now your argument is that we should stop cutting down forests...something I agree with. This isn’t the same as shifting the global energy platform from oil and natural gas to sunlight, water, air and other renewable sources...
@edfischman @McFaul No you are a sheep. You’re ignorance about the money behind politics would be astounding to me if it wasn’t so expected from a Bernie supporter. It took less than 20 years for the ozone problem to be solved. It didn’t require a massive shift in environmental policy.
@edfischman @McFaul Human related deaths don’t prove causation, though they may show correlation. Famines and droughts have been prominent in recorded human history, I doubt you attribute those to human industry...
@edfischman @McFaul That is the story of living things. Just like people die so do other living things. And from death comes rebirth. Our planet was able to become fruitful again after numerous ice ages. Somethings are out of our control. Let’s not forget the fear about the ozone layer...
@edfischman @McFaul India depends on coal, China &amp; japan are sitting on massive oil fields in the South China Sea, the USA has invested in infrastructure for our new natural gas and oil finds. And again, every nation that signed the PA have had to reassess its pollution reduction promises.
@edfischman @McFaul We aren’t setting the world on fire nor destroying the entire eco system. The green energy technologies are not efficient enough, would lead to drastic increases in bills to consumers, and there simply isn’t mass appeal to provide such technologies world wide.
@NonnaSJF @McFaul I also submit that the climate changes, as it should, and nothing remains static. I also believe that the measure of destruction is being evaluated by a $ amount rather than science. We are in our infancy of understanding the planet. Remember fear over the deterioration of ozone?
@NonnaSJF @McFaul I’m for the advancement of the human race and better lives for all humans. I also submit that the earth is a far more powerful force than humans and will adjust in a way that does not destroy the human race. Furthermore, I don’t believe the situation is as dire as you do.

@NonnaSJF @McFaul Do you realize how small an amount of time decades are compared to 4.5 billion years or are you purposefull this obtuse?
@dermotsFizz @McFaul It takes a highly intelligent person to make such a profound comment like yours...😏
@Zekesgirl1959 @McFaul Well FAT ASS, look up solyndra, look up the other investments made by the obama administration into green energy products, look at the cost of these green energy projects and then compare them to fossil fuel industries. Once you open your mind you’ll see.
@EmmaLevert @McFaul Care to argue substance or is this the best you could come up with?
@Bwonk_Bwonk @siouxsiespal @McFaul Well that’s because Germany doesn’t have fossil fuels sitting on German land. Sure there are pockets of coal, but there isn’t oil or natural gas, like there is in Scandinavian waters. Same goes for continental Europe.
@McLovinSJ @McFaul Really? Every single thing? Please look up what happened to Solyndra and numerous other green energy projects that the obama administration invested in. Then see who owns them and then see if they donated to his campaigns.
@NonnaSJF @McFaul You’re aware that this planet is 4.5 billion years old, has had numerous ice ages, and had organisms that precede humans by hundreds of millions of years right?
@edfischman @McFaul Are you intentionally ignoring the fact that the Paris accords are non binding and self enforcing? Or that all nations are already admitting they won’t be able to meet their promises in decreasing its own pollution levels?
@rickrow @McFaul If you think follower count is indicative of making factual points you must also believe @realDonaldTrump, @Cristiano, @justinbieber, @KimKardashian are authorities on all things. Perhaps it’s best if you close down your account.
@bigskyrad @McFaul Your naivety on the subject professor, is an indictment on your inability to argue substantively. Perhaps, as a radiologist you should stick to medicine and leave policy discussion to those of us who have studied the relationships between politics and policy.
@McFaul What is the definition of a “nationalist?” You are making it sound like putting your nation first is a bad thing, and I’d even go so far as ignoring how a word’s definition evolves over time. An example being the word “liberalism.”
@n_e_azil I think you need to be a little less naive about the nexus between POLICY and POLITICS. Have a nice day.
@Bwonk_Bwonk @siouxsiespal @McFaul Well actually Germany is roughly 37% dependent on renewables, like solar, but still receives the lion share of its energy in the form of non-renewable imports from Russia.
@siouxsiespal @McFaul The really sad part about your comment is that you’re attacking an immaterial issue in order to prove a point that is totally removed from the goal of your assertion, AND that 9 other people are as brain dead as you (or tribalistic) that they agreed with you.
@n_e_azil And let’s not ignore the fact that there’s a significant difference between a massive increase in damage (based on material manmade structures) vs. an increase in frequency and ferocity of natural weather incidents.
@n_e_azil Additionally, the USA has the ability to be the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and oil, China just found massive amounts in the South China Sea (currently fighting w/ japan over it) and India is creating more coal plants than before. Only Europe benefits.
@n_e_azil Consider this, it’s a non binding agreement, self enforcing, there’s no authority to punish nations for not reaching their goals. Furthermore, it requires developing nations to move from cheaper and dirtier energy sources to cleaner and more expensive. How can they afford that?
@n_e_azil I am a Floridian...I think I understand the impact of hurricanes better than you do. Given that I’ve lived through Andrew, Katrina, George, and about 100 more.

@McFaul Can you be honest with your followers and explain to them how not a single nation which signed the accords is expected to meet their target goals to decrease pollution?
@CafeLatteLu @McFaul Your comment is peak naivety and tribalism.
@McFaul Also, Anerica decreasing its pollution, while well intended, does not compensate for the growing amount of pollution contribution from China (47%) and developing nations like India, which depend on non-renewables. Europe on the other hand lacks such energy resources.
It’s rather obtuse to believe that the planet requires humans to “save it.” This astronomical body has survived, suffered, gone through tremendous changes for 4.5 billion years, your comment screams of arrogance. Damage to humanity has increased due to human development/expansion https://t.co/ztttSmqxxT
@McFaul Obama signed the Paris Accord in order to advance investments in green energy, which are some of the democrats biggest backers. It doesn’t matter that the technology isn’t efficient enough nor competitive with non-renewables, or would hurt the average American citizen.

Historically the trend is that the party of the president loses seats in the midterms. However, regardless of history they are usually related to the perception of the President. He may not need to be blamed but held responsible for some of the things he said or done. https://t.co/o6EzKOnBKD

@pboldosser @Linassp3 @kebejay I agree that income/wage is relative to the local economy, but we have to also be reasonable about exploitation and having at least basic standards. Qatar, UAE, and many other middle eastern governments are not short on capital. FIFA even awarded the World Cup to Qatar...
@pboldosser @Linassp3 @kebejay The money hardly makes a difference and these East Asian and even persons from Mongolia, Nepal, etc. are forced to remain in these middle eastern nations.
@pboldosser @kebejay $500 a month for over 350+ hours of work a month is slavery.
This truth is completely ignored by western media and 99.9% of the world’s citizens. Slavery still exists in the Middle East and the rest of the world virtue signals about caring for these people/issues. Oh and this tweet just scratches the surface. https://t.co/nH3h9hLbCF

@TwoDogNW @pat_mag @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Are you talking about yourself? Notice how in my responses I discuss substance and in your responses you just attack me and provide opinion commentary. You make sweeping generalizations and ignore the numerous reports that provide that the economy under Trump is amazing.
@TwoDogNW @pat_mag @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Lol stop looking at it solely from a macro scale and solely from the Canadian point of view. Americans who compete with Canadians in certain industries, that are unfairly subsidized by the Canadian government, have decimated the American counterpart industry in same field.
@AudreyS04403844 @LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Taxes don’t show that, financial disclosures would. A tax form shows taxes that have to be paid for income gained in the prior fiscal year...😒🤓

@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Did you just use the word “minstrel” because Don Lemon used that about Kanye West? Anyways Canadians need to focus on canadanian politics before focusing on American, you guys did elect Trudeau 😂
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yea, well that’s what happens when Canadian cable only has CNN and no conservative outlets. As for everything else in your tweet, which I find inaccurate is not worth dignifying with a response.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 If that’s your opinion you’re free to hold it. But you sound like Trump. I don’t mind this posture if it’s based on facts. As a Canadian, if I were you I wouldn’t share this point of view with other fellow Canadians.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Lol, so as I’ve said before, you look at the world and issues as binary choices. It’s either black or white. That’s not realistic. It’s “free” in the sense that there aren’t artificial controls used to prevent the private marketplace from developing on its own.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 No it’s not devestating in that it has completely destroyed an industry however, it is devestating to the individuals in those industries, especially as Canadian subsidies force American costs up.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Can you be more specific when you say violent US based crime- who exactly are you speaking of? And are you saying Canada should shutter it’s border with the USA or saying the USA needs to shutter its border with Mexico?
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 That’s not the same as a tariff or subsidies! Lol come on. Tariffs and subsidies apply to private goods sold and exported/imported. You’re confounding this issues. The USA government isn’t force to buy abroad.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 And the USA isn’t blackmailing Canada, it’s forcing Canada to lower its tariffs on American exports and to lowere subsidies in industries that are devestating to the American industry.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 India and Pakistan have the most volatile shared border in the world, they are enemies with each other, both carry nukes, and their shared history is littered with conflict. That’s not the same characterization I would apply to the USA/Canada relationship.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There is nothing about the USA military complex that distorts any market. US military equipment is consistently more advanced than that if every other nation, and so smaller nations choose to buy from the USA.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 It’s not a subsidy, it’s an industry based on supply and demand. The US government has the world’s largest military, it purchases products and exports its services around the world in addition to conduction its own set of offensive and defensive maneuvers to protect US interests.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 If you think pro-American is anti-Canadian and anti- every other nation in the world, that means your views of international political dynamics is warped. This isn’t a 0 sum game. Have a good day.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Wow. I feel sorry for you. You must really take Canada’s place in the world’s hierarchy for granted. Yet alone the mere fact that nations like GB and France are still in the UN Security Council.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Your belief is rather binary and not pragmatic. It’s not like I’m a dual citizen of India and Pakistan.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I agree with this statement. Again, that’s not the same as imposing high tariffs on goods you sell to your “friends.” And the western world and probably the majority of the world benefits from an American ability to keep other markets stable.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Individual states cannot impose stricter laws concerning trade than federal laws without conflicting with the commerce clause. And yes the US government restricts the purchase of products to US goods, there’s nothing wrong with that. And the USA has the most free market.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Who are you with these rules? Trump isn’t anti-Canadian, he’s pro American. If you don’t understand that difference than I can imagine you struggle with a lot.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Morally fraudulent? Lol what?
@frankmalone110 @realDonaldTrump In order for him to be considered either corrupt or a criminal he’d first need to be found guilty of a crime, and more specifically corruption.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Of course he pays federal income tax. Unless he’s suffered a massive loss prior. The USA government helps people to save and restore their wealth if they’ve lost big in the past. Everyone can claim this due to a bad investment or purchase.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 They don’t pay a lower rate of income tax, they’re able to claim more deductions and credits due to their diversified portfolios. The progressive income tax already requires people who make over $400,000 significantly higher percentage of their federal income tax.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 JEFF Bezos, for instance, an avowed Democrat, is the world’s wealthiest person with $120 billion+ why don’t democrats demand that he give up over 59% of his wealth to help so many of our poor?
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 The markets are hurting because of an increase in the federal interest rate. The industry that has been hurt is the tech sector which has also seen the largest gains under Trump. Obviously the 1% will attain more wealth but the poor are getting wealthier but the gap is growing.

@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes they are, like I said before and source to a Forbes news article his net worth, dropped roughly $400 million since his election up until the date the article was written.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 His businesses lost money first and foremost because he stopped being the face of it, he’s not the one selling the company around the world. And because he speaks genuinely and impolitely people don’t like him and protest/boycott/attack his brand.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There is no law that requires an American government official to divest or hold in a blind trust. It’s anti-American to strip someone of their personal financial assets in order to serve. The USA has numerous checks to prevent such corruption.
@edfischman @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Do you have proof that he has used his role to get wealthy? Where his primary intent was to help himself? And if “they wrote it off” then they took advantage of their accountant’s superior knowledge of tax law.

@pat_mag @TwoDogNW @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 If you think people who disagree with you are trolls then you continue to show your intolerance for Trump supporters as well as how closed minded you are. I expected as much but was patient. I see no reason to speak further.
@pat_mag @TwoDogNW @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 You sound like a racist.
@TwoDogNW @pat_mag @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Are you a racist?
@edfischman @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 The man was wealthy before he became President, he didn’t need to win to get wealthy. You can’t say that about the Obamas or Clinton’s, who INCREASED their wealth to $80 million and $300 million respectively.
@JoelCraig1 @SP2755 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes tariffs raise prices, that’s obvious, how ever do they raise prices to the point where the impact is noticeable? The answer has been so far, a resounding NO.
@trahana @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 His intent was never to make money off of his presidency, if you really believe what you say I pity you for thinking that. Anyways I’ve read enough of your tweets to realize not to take you seriously.
@trahana @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You need to read up on the history of American presidents and their dispositions to women, Chinese, Japanese, native Mexicans, the French, the Germans, the Russians, etc. Trump is no different from many Presidents.
@PitBullPaw @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 If you’re caught up on a simple grammar mistake and highlight that mistake and don’t discuss the substance you’re likely incapable of having substantive conversation.
@trahana @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I can understand that. He’s certainly not interested in playing nice and that hurts peoples feelings. He is ruthless, as most leaders are, otherwise they shouldn’t lead nations. He puts his country first and he expects gratitude to America. It’s interesting philosophy.
@willemin_mike @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 If you read my responses to other people who posted the same comment, I posted a Forbes article to support my argument.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Bloomberg, Forbes, Financial Times, CNBC, etc., economic news, Because it’s far less partisan. All those cable networks are tools of the democrats or republicans.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Oh by the way, I laugh at Fox News, CNN and MSNBC- cable news is for fools.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes he had multiple single quarters that exceed Q2 2018, that’s not what I said though. I said Obama never had a full year exceed 3% growth. He’s the first president in history to serve 8 years and not have GDP exceed 3%, under Trump it’s going to happen in year 2.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes, we’ve heard that Democrat talking point before, unfortunately all the economic data says otherwise. And yes there was stock buy back and that’s not all. The tax cuts brought corporations from abroad back into the USA and has led to new foreign investment.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Also because Trump governs with corporate growth in mind investors are more likely to invest due to an ease in the amending of the tax code. More investors = expansion = more jobs. And this goes beyond publicly traded companies.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 It’s doing exceptionally better, the difference is remarkable. Under Trump GDP growth exceeds over 3.6% this year, we are expected to grow over 3.4% this year, confidence indexes are at it near all time highs. Obama didn’t exceed 3% in any single year.
@kmskflix @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 What are you talking about? We hold military positions adverse to Russia, we use our economic leverage against them, there have been 0 policy shifts that have worked for the benefit of Russia...
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 So now you want all Trump supporters to apologize for breathing and also generalize that every single one of them had mental issues. Do you purposefully belittle what mentally challenged people suffer through?
@gzuckier @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 None of what you just said makes sense lol. In fact younust admitted he’s never been charged.
@gzuckier @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 It’s amazing how so “in the know” you are when Trump nor anyone close to him has been charged with anything remotely close to working with the Russians to sway the election.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 What does “you should apologize for breathing” mean to you? I need to breath to live so if you want to not admit that you’re unstable that’s fine but mental health isn’t a joke...go seek help.
@gzuckier @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You must not listen closely to what he says. Nor did you watch him on 60 minutes tonight. That’s not his position nor the position of his supporters.
@gzuckier @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 No. But his campaign did spend only $390 million compared to HRC spending over $758 million.
@JoelCraig1 @SP2755 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 The USA has superior leverage over Canada. If Canada tries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs the USA government can account for them while the Canadian tariffs will hurt Canadian consumers.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 And yet the economy is growing at rates we haven’t seen in over 12 years.
@Dr_Betsy94 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Why would I watch Fox News? I gave up on cable news years ago...only CNN and MSNBC zealots talk like you do.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There is something wrong with you. You should seek mental health counseling and explain how you want people with different political beliefs to die.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Well if the majority of Canadians believe that Trump supporters should die maybe the problem is not with me...
@kmskflix @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There isn’t a single President who has ever represented ALL Americans, except in title solely, which was my point from the start.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You represent the “tolerant” left right?
@Maria28978476 @GeraldMassoud @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You’re right. It’s easier for the wealthy to accumulate wealth and so no matter the polices that aids them to expand they will always receive a larger per capita share. But the people as a whole will receive more benefit that the companies as a whole.
@midlifeshift @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 These countries don’t think Trump is stupid, they think he’s too smart because he knows how to apply pressure to enhance American prosperity. The American economy is doing exceptional, the rest of the world not so much. Especially Europe, which is nearing economic stagnation.
@midlifeshift @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes his tariffs are TEMPORARY. They are used as a negotiating tool in order to force concessions. He does this because the USA has the world’s largest economy and is the most developed, we represent 25% of world GDP, so he can leverage our influence for equal treatment.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I agree.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 My point is that whether it is a surplus is irrelevant. Obviously America can purchase more imports because we have more purchasing power AND also export more worldwide because we produce more. The issue is having equal import and export levies across all industries and nations.

@Cheryl_Quist @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Well there are numerous ways to respect someone/something.
@Cheryl_Quist @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I think Canada has proven they respect Trump (maybe not in a positive, look up to sense) and I think this was proven as Canadian negotiators conceded to the point that America agreed to a renegotiation.
@Cheryl_Quist @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 When you say “respect” do you really mean “likes?” When I hear respect I hear acquiescence and understanding. Trump has made the American position clear to Canadians. I also hate Trudeau ;)
@margssister @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Provide evidence of that. But while you’re at it the American citizens are benefitting immensely from his administrations economic policies.
@Jobit12 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes he charges secret service to rent out his rooms. He should be taking those losses personally but he’s charging the American taxpayer. As for the evidence, I have had other conversations stemming from the preceding post where I have posted an article from Forbes.
@Neoavatara Sometimes he’s just a bit too honest 😂
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 This also sounds like you believe that Canada and the USA producing equal amounts of exports (products and services) which isn’t the case. USA buys more and exports more to probably every country, because we are the 3rd largest and most wealthy.
@Maria28978476 @GeraldMassoud @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There have been various estimates from 2017 that predicted as high as $600 million, we are about to enter Q4 of 2018, it would make sense to expect similar losses the following year until we see a leveling off.
@pat_mag @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes it is a welfare of sorts, the key part is that it’s temporary. Unlike the welfare given away under various social nets, and general welfare for all people which does not have a temporary purpose or fixed ending.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I think you’re ignoring that your economic philosophy doesn’t gel with our free market approach. That problem is playing out in reality, impacting the American counterparts, and it’s any American president’s job to help out Americans. Trump is figuring out an easy way to do it
@SP2755 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes he did, if you want to call it a bailout or a future advance in anticipation of future adverse effects. I actually think it was $16 billion, but it pails in comparison to the auto bailout and bank bailouts that were in the trillions. Also agriculture exports were up to cover.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes I know what a surplus is, I’m telling you that there is a fancy accounting error that calculates, or rather is added, that concerns imports/exports from 3rd countries that travel through ports that then move on to CA or vice versa in which those are considered CA/USA exports
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Well Trumps tariffs are targeting industries that the Canadian government subsidized dramatically, steel, timber/lumber, maple syrup (yes lol). I don’t think you’re correct that Americans buy less Canadian goods than Canadians buy American, given our 10x pop size.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 He did change more than just its name, I know you don’t believe that, especially given the pace of renegotiations and how Canada renegotiated after USA and Mexico struck a deal. https://t.co/fBlO7ZznM1
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 His talking point “I alone can fix it” seems more like a selling skill, even if it’s completely outlandish, detached from reality, and rather useless.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I’m not surprised by that fact. It’s actually based on an accounting concerning imports/exports that come trough ports of third countries. The USA citizenry has more capital than any other nation, we buy more of foreign nations good than they do ours. Unless they don’t export.
@bfm4440 Oh, and there’s only 1 President of the United States, he governs for all Americans, and “govern” doesn’t mean “agree.”
@bfm4440 25% of all American citizens voted, but we actually had roughly 55% of eligible voters vote. https://t.co/M6C2PDxyDW	And yes more people voted for HRC, pop vote doesn’t count, but obvs population would be higher now that ever before, your argument is a red herring.
@GeraldMassoud @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Clearly you either didn’t read the articles I posted, OR, and mostly likely, you don’t like that they contradict your McGuire’s beliefs and since you’re driven by your hatred of Trump, facts don’t matter to you. Either way, you’ve realized you’re not worth engaging with.
@marnaesch48 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Please read other threads from this conversation before I respond. Thank you
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes my second “your” was supposed to be “you’re,” it’s a good thing you know how to focus on substance and aren’t easily distracted...😒have a nice day.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Well your mind is made up, that much you’ve admitted. Also tariffs in the abstract hurt, but your ignoring the realized application of these tariffs, to what degree, on what products, and for what purpose. But I digress.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @GeraldMassoud @MaryH319 Granted, but the estimates are big losses. There are no estimates out there that say his wealth or that of Trump Organization’s, or its subsidiaries, is increasing. It’s commonly believed by many on the left that his wealth is increasing, absent any evidence.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Tariffs haven’t cost many job losses. In actuality economic planning in the other side to buoy farmers and punished industries have led to short term gains due to an increase in exports. Tariffs are being used to force other nations to drop their tariffs on our exports.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 His tax reform did provide more money to corporations with a lower tax rate and what’s not discussed is that those same corporations weren’t getting taxed anything prior to the cut because they were headquartered abroad, which is legal under the USA tax code.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Presidents never truly take vacations, they do escape Washington DC and the White House. Congress is in session for less than 200 days a year. And governing can happen virtually anywhere.

@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond It’s rather arrogant of human beings to think only they can fix this climate change, when we live less than 100 years and the earth has been around for 4.5 billion. And if you want to talk about the Mueller investigation, name 1 person charged w/conspiracy against the USA.
@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Isn’t that exactly what you’re doing- speculating- by believing a narrative absent facts. It’s rather big headed to think that because the climate has changed .1 degrees or .5 over the last 100 years that the earth can’t correct this gradual change, but only humans can.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I hear so many Trump haters repeat this false assertion. Trump lost over $800,000,000 in net worth since his election. Ivanka closed down shopping lines. And his sons rent running the businesses as well as he did. What you’re saying is completely inaccurate.
https://t.co/1vePkaaLRx
@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Trump collusion with Russia?
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 He’s not gaslighting. I’ve actually studied many trade issues between the USA and Canada as well as the USA and other nations. Why would he be seeking revenge against Trudeau or any of these leaders? He’s never had relations with them.
@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Thanks for trying to control how a conversation goes...anything else you want to control?
@McFaul Values are abstract, and interpreted by each individual differently, yet alone differently between cultures. Pragmatism must be the priority.
@Timjitsu67 @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Yes I agree. War invaded Iraq under false pretenses, and then Iran took advantage and aggressively maneuvered their way into Iraq and Syria. That aggression is threatening the Middle East. Additionally, Iran funds the coup/Houthis in Yemen, which is attacking Saudi Arabia.
@McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond The first question has to be- why does Saudi Arabia fear Iran NOW? Iran had been sanctioned by the USA and many western nations for years, they hadn’t taken a foothold into Syria and Iraq until the Obama administration. That needs to be admitted first. And then fixed.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I’m a Canadian and an American, why should I, a trump supporter apologize for Trump governing FOR Americans? Is that not what Trudeau is doing for Canadians by not agreeing with Trump?
@ddale8 They don’t have to like what he does, but they are respecting the fact that America has the leverage and Canada isn’t going to get what it wants. Where’s the inaccuracy there?
@MSNBC Haha our moral credibility was lost when we did nothing in Syria for years as over 500,000 civilians were ruthlessly murder and Obama did nothing! It was further eroded as Turkey arrested hundreds of journalists and Obama did nothing. SMH

@MaxBoot I’m confused, so you like the GOPs anti-communism stance but tell people to vote democrat when a substantial about of democrats want to push for larger government and more social systems akin to socialism? Color me perplexed.
@kylegriffin1 Yes this is completely legal. Why are you attempting to make this look wrong? This is bad “journalism,” motivated by partisanship rather than objectivity.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan I’m a big supporter of yours and I understand we don’t control how every world leader gets to act, but it’s time to leverage Turkey towards reforms. Erdogan is a terrible leader, especially to minorities. He’s consolidated power and now leads a dictatorship of sorts.

@BaneOf_TheSith @JoeNBC Correct, which is my point. Great Britain didn’t defeat the Nazis, they withstood the Nazis. The Russians defeated the Nazis at Stalingrad and pushed them out of Russia. And the USA came from France and pushed Germany all the way back to Berlin. The USA&amp; Russia defeated the Nazis
@BaneOf_TheSith @JoeNBC Ok so you’re British. The Nazis lost to Russia because they pulled a Napoleon and tried to fight in the Russian winter during their invasion. And yes 2 fronts was dumb but when France conceded as easily as they did...GB defended itself more than win an offensive.
@BaneOf_TheSith @JoeNBC “Hadn’t held off” when referring to Blitzkreig and the destruction of London doesn’t make sense. And the blitzkreig vs GB had nothing to do with the Russian winter stopping the Nazis.

@MJB_SF @AGoodStoic @McFaul The illegal immigration debate is extremely complex. 1st, many children are sent alone to the border, or are trafficked in. 2nd, no non American citizen has the right to enter the USA. 3rd the USA accepts more asylum seekers than the rest of the world combined.
@MJB_SF @AGoodStoic @McFaul Trump has paid an income tax every year he has been required to do so. As have his corporations. Roy Moore is an alleged pedophile, he has never been found guilty in a court of law, obviously Trump wanted a Republican senator over a democrat one.
@AGoodStoic @MJB_SF @McFaul Soros is known for actually collaborating with the Nazis to survive. He sold out Hungarian Jews for his own survival, not that I fault him for trying to survive. And Alex Jones clearly shares conservative views but he’s an extreme individual. He doesn’t represent all Republicans

@daenachristy @jryan19892 @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot Personally, I think this is over reaction. The Court hears roughly 300 cases a year, maybe. True power lies in the appellate courts.
@daenachristy @jryan19892 @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot This is arguably the first time since 1934 that the Supreme Court has a true conservative tilt. FDR is famous for stacking the entire bench with left of center Justices through his 13 years. And Chief Justice Roberts voted in favor of ACA although appointed by Bush.
@benshapiro Are you now a Trump supporter after he has appointed 2 conservative justices? Will you be voting for him?

@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot The issue is did BK commit sexual assault against Dr. Ford, and did he lie about it. None of the “witnesses” Ford claims to have been present have any knowledge of such a party or incident. Same story goes for Debra Ramirez. These cases would never make it to trial.
@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot If you really believe what you preach you should have each of your sons (&amp; husband) go to the police and ask them to investigate all interactions with women and to clear their name. Apply the same standard you do to BK to your fam. And don’t get emotional or adversarial either.
@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot You don’t know that your sons never attempted to rape anyone. Maybe your sons should be investigated absent any corroborative evidence, you know- just to be sure.
@SilviaAstoria @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot No. Judges are very forgiving and are nothing like what you see on tv and in the movies. However, if this case had gone through the legal process it would have been thrown out quite early due to a lack of evidence and possibly an SOL application.
@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot Equating the BK confirmation to ALL accusations of sexual assault is the epitome of extreme and irrational thinking. It completely ignores treating each case as unique, each accuser as an individual, ignores facts, and ignores the presumption of innocent until proven guilty.
It’s pretty obvious that with such polar opposite responses to the FBI investigations one party is lying. That same party is attacking our institutions and saying the FBI did a poor job of investigating. The next question must be -Why are they acting in such a manner? https://t.co/qEjVfQackG

@InsideATureen @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot You realize that Kavanaugh being confirmed is not fantasy but actually your reality? We all know that BK was the subject of a smear campaign motivated by denying him a seat on the bench. There’s no corroborative evidence to any of the accusers’ stories.
@halesr2539 Do you want to talk about Robert Bork? I’d be happy to talk to you about the history of Supreme Court Justices. We can talk about Hugo Black, or the FDR scorpion court, or a whole slew of interesting nominations through American history that you have never learned about.
@RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot By the way, unless you’re appointed and need to be confirmed through the political process your job application to work at a private company will never be as rancorous and political as what we see in DC. Your analogy is irrelevant.
@RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot Mere allegations and his response to partisan smears absent any corroborative evidence does not taint the Supreme Court. In fact, it was the actions of the Democrats that have made a mockery out of nominations to the Supreme Court.
@MaxBoot ACCUSATIONS
