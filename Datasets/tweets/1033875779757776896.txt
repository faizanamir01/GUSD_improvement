treated like animals, instead of human beings, elderly being forgotten, abused, &amp;killed because they are old. WE NEED GOVERNMENT REFORM FOR STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. This all has to change. I hope you can get those fires burning! We need a hero.
Collapsing,doctors &amp; nurses that don’t know how to do anything but kill patients, DEA &amp; insurances decide whether you live or die &amp; how much suffering you deserve,no hydrants for firemen to put out fires,farmers not making enough to properly take care of livestock,women still
the American people, need to audit the government, state &amp; federal. Someone needs to tells us why no one is capable of fixing or upgrading public systems! Americans majority are dying &amp; suffering of horrible disease, no drinking water, houses blowing up, cops murdering, bridges
I think it’s interesting that most countries’ governments except USA take care of their people. USA grades: EDUCATION:F-, HEALTHCARE: F, DENTISTRY: F, AGRICULTURE : F-, INFRASTRUCTURE: F-,WELFARE: F, EMERGENCY SERVICES: F-. WHAT’S OUR MONEY BEING USED FOR? I think we, https://t.co/m1kWpdtIED

@QueenDPortugal They won’t lock him up. Jussie would get conditional probation is convicted. The felony that they are charging him with is the same one that someone would get if they were caught driving without insurance in Illinois. He didn’t kill/rape anyone. He projected hate just like Trump.
@QueenDPortugal The charge doesn’t fit the crime, the evidence is circumstantial and incorrect, Jussie didn’t admit to wrongdoing or the crime, Jussie has witnesses stating what happened, the Chicago PD facts are based on hearsay. The brothers had motive to lie; they didn’t want to go to jail.

Infidels? Who’s wearing uncomfortable clothes, in uncomfortable temperatures, &amp; being treated like a insignificant slave animal in the middle of a wasteland? They may be self righteous cranky people but this isn’t the good life, or being/living better than an “ infidel”. https://t.co/cDLgbLicOc

@JaneFallon Nice bird.
Once you become a terrorist/traitor of USA;there really isn’t wiggle room to come back. I’ve heard that to claim sanctuary,or be protected,you need to make a deal to provide intel but probably best to find citizenship somewhere else. Great example of what not to do. https://t.co/GcVgVRqAcx

If this sounds like you or if you’re a town idiot; put down your media device,&amp;educate yourself on reality. Media can sway emotions to love one another&amp; bring peace to the world,however,it’s a boring story no one seems to be interested in. Stop hating because someone told you to.
Media creates fear &amp; hate. This is why we have the town idiot(town idiot:a monster in its own category) that kills, harms,fires employees,refuses to do right,ignores or hates people of a certain race, sex, gender,or whatever your special birth issue is.
What kind of racist are you?Whites:Everyone thinks we are”privileged”,&amp;hate us. Latins:Everyone wants us locked up/deported&amp; hates us.Asian&amp;Orientals:No one knows we exist.Blacks:Everyone hates us,&amp;trying to kill us. LGBTQ:Everyone hates us. THAT IS MEDIA CAUSED RACISM. https://t.co/iHar7EcGjq

@Beckiwadderz @rustyrockets 4. Addicts are determined to destroy themselves &amp; anyone whom tries to stop their destruction. So, how do you get them to stop? 1. Manipulation, continuously remind them through your actions that you know they’re not perfect,life is very difficult but we fight, we don’t give up.
@Beckiwadderz @rustyrockets With addiction,You really need to know what animal you are dealing with. You must realize,1. You cannot control an addict. 2. An addict is self serving &amp; is not interested in your drama. 3. Addicts have large egos to compensate for the reality they are running from.

Did anyone notice that the house was working on indictment for criminal Trump. So to distract everyone from this &amp; slow down investigations in progress; Trump shuts down the government. A criminal is getting away with murder again. By 2020, another nation will buy the USA. Shame. https://t.co/ujv08hB4c7
So Trump is saying that a “good patriot” is a slave in the union? I guess slavery wasn’t abolished. Slavery was unionized by rich. I thought Immigrants left England to become free of a monarchy. I guess we forgot what our ancestors fought for. Our government is bullshit. https://t.co/Zu2PyZe8ot

Taking time for your mother is number 1 priority. Deep breaths, patience, being supportive &amp;manyconversations to be had. Your mother doesn’t have to remember you,but she does need a friend.

I don’t think we should erase genders of man or woman. Add;don’t erase. Media makes you believe that it’s only one way. There are bad people in every sex,gender,race, who hate or attack. Don’t fuel hate with hate and outrage. Extinguish hate with intelligence and understanding.

So you know they yell “go home!”&amp; throw trash at tourists from their cars,locals call salem the “ghetto”,people on the mainland “massholes”, guns pointed, threats made. Me &amp; 65 in our group planned to stay for a week &amp;left within the first two days. Mainland $300k+ vs Salem$39k. https://t.co/eoLWF7yZCg

@lmPostMalone @Sofiaeliza5 It’s hard to miss someone who is always here. It’s hard to “work things out” when neither party will shut up and listen. It’s easy to take someone or something for granted when it is received without difficulty. When people take anything for granted it loses it’s worth.
