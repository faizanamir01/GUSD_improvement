There’s INFINITE possibilities in the world and our education system is one of the main sources of the corruption in America.
There’s nothing wrong with becoming a nurse, a stay at home mom, or a doctor but what is wrong is conditioning people early on in their development that those are the only options.
When I moved to Maryland and went to school there, I took mostly honors and advanced classes. 		At the same education level, those two states were extremely different in the way they educate kids.
In Tennessee, their education system is so crooked that a child care program is worth more credits than a STEM field credit. Granted, that was back when I was in school but from the looks of it there’s still growing racism, ignorance, and lack of education in TN and like States.
but that’s only going to benefit doctors and fortune 500s while the homeless remain homeless, sick stay sick, and rich stay ridiculously rich while the rest of the nation suffers.
Are they intending on us to all being sick and depending on pills in the future? I’m not trying to stir anything or inspire any conspiracies, I’m just stating the obvious. 		Too many people think “More jobs= healthier economy”
Think about that for a second; We still have one of the World’s worst health care out there yet we are going to employ millions more nurses? How about system analysis specialists, accountants, entrepreneurs, system creators, statistics specialists, engineers, &amp;vibration analysis
Don’t you all find it odd how all these hospital careers are coming up (I think over 2 million) vs other job options?

I really don’t think that the US Government is all that bad and any flaws in the system are mostly due to the wars we have fought over the years which effected our policies, therefore effecting our nation.
Why do so many people dislike the American Government when their “facts” are based off of opinions, biased research, and news that’s funded by certain political parties.
I politely disagree. The very top only know how to fight wars, not to prepare for peace and that’s why we stay stuck in wars. https://t.co/erOGDxMbcQ

Also be careful giving money to those who “advise” you. Chances are the best advice you’ll get is from the soulful experienced ones who do not charge for wisdom.
Happy House Estates was inspired by my mothers business, Estate Escape. My mother loves the 80s and I personally love The Weeknd’s “House of Balloons” use of Sioux and the Banshees “Happy House”. 		It was the glue that pieced all the inspiration of the bigger picture for me.
I know I’m treading the line between, “constructive criticism” and “not minding my business” but I know that I would want free intellectual advice from those who have experience as well.
If your mindset is stuck at, “I don’t want to change.” Your business will reflect that. If you don’t want to change your business, sell it.
Sex sells sure, but that doesn’t mean that’s the best way to do business. Using basic human needs as a sales pitch will only keep your business stuck in a primal mode. In order to advance, you have to take a look at your business system and change the bugs in it.
