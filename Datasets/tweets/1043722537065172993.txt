We detain illegal aliens we give them shelter, food &amp; care! We should give them a job too! BUILDING THE WALL!They came here for work, so they say!Give them immediate employment! It will be done in no time &amp; will save $! #IBW ! ILLEGALS BUILD WALL!
@AnnCoulter When we detain the illegal aliens , why not put them to work building the wall!! They came here to work supposedly! Give them shelter, food &amp; a job !! What more could they ask for ?!!!
@FreeEire18 @designinghomes @AnnCoulter Put them to work building the wall!!!!
@AnnCoulter 😂😂😂👍🏼
@Fox35Brooks @Fox35News @Twitter @CollingwoodFC @WestCoastEagles Asparagus 😂😂
@Zenber1 @ColorInFusion @AnnCoulter @ABC Why don’t you concentrate on CURRENT factually proven abusers AND LIARS your party is elevating CURRENTLY like CORY BOOKER that admitted in a column while @ Stanford where he groped a girls breast or KEITH ELLISON that abused his GF where DR records corroborate her story! SMH🙄🤨
@stopalready23 @JaneMayerNYer @FBI FBI investigation,round 7-Ford”Brett Kavanaugh sexually attacked me but don’t know when or where &amp;the ONE friend w/me Denys my whole story! The others I said were there ALL said they WERE NOT!Kavanaugh- I’ve never met Ford &amp; NEVER assaulted ANYONE! THE END!
RT @timoneill85: @JaneMayerNYer @RoscoeGerm Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.🔥
@timoneill85 @JaneMayerNYer @RoscoeGerm First of all that’s NOT true .. guess you’ve never heard of a smoke machine ! Please don’t EVER go to a Halloween event esp Halloween horror nites @ Universal. You’ll be the only idiot calling 911 to report a fire!! Demwit! 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️
RT @soireepro: @JaneMayerNYer What if he's innocent? You are helping to try to destroy a mans whole career. #stopthecraziness #whatifheisin…
@Zenber1 @ColorInFusion @AnnCoulter @ABC Wow one guy that actually knew Brett and didn’t care for him ... wow! That certainly makes him guilty of sexual assault vs hundreds of people maybe thousands who grew up with him who say the opposite! Introduce that as guilt in any court or case or investigation means NOTHING!
@BMatteau @ColorInFusion @AnnCoulter Ah another “factual opinion “!Lmao 🤔😂yes it’s all clear now, he has all the markings ! WHITE MALE, CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN = rapist , racist , gambler and obviously on the take ! Wow how did I miss that one, all he needed was his MAGA hat and I’d have spotted that deplorable!🙄
@Phil_Caravella @ColorInFusion @AnnCoulter Name ONE proven fact of Kavanaugh’s “ unfitness” other than Trump nominated him? Really just ONE FACTUALLY PROVEN UNFIT QUALITY that is not political in nature or your unfactual opine!
@dee69jay @ColorInFusion @AnnCoulter Ohhhh i see so this is revenge ?!!! Oh but it’s ok .. he’ll be fine with all his white man privilege .. he probably didn’t really like his career , wife &amp; kids or reputation .. he’d much rather be a sacrificial lamb &amp; martyr like Spartacus!!  NOT!!
@frances_birnie @thehill Idiot
@Mimirocah1 @Barack_McBush Omg soooo Demwitted..In case you missed it - FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS Kavanaugh =5 !! FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS Accusers=0 !! SMH🙄😫
@DaMadGreek13 @AnnCoulter 😂😂😂and it never will be unless they get the accusers for purgery and find the texts of demwitted colusion! 😂😂😂
@Barack_McBush @AnnCoulter Kavanaugh FBI background Checks =5   Accusers =0 ... enuf said Kavanaugh WINS!
@autumnj2001 @AnnCoulter Hmm..🤔Who is Kavanaugh’s attorney? Oh that’s right innocent people don’t usually ask for one!!!
@90210_gal Hmmm ..FBI background checks on Kavanaugh =5  Background Checks Accusers =0... Kavanaugh WINS!
@mcraiser @KimStrassel Name ONE reason  he’s unacceptable then? Other than false allegations &amp; doesn’t fit the Demwits narrative ,why do YOU think he’s unacceptable ? Hurry now read his 300 opinions and I’ll hold my breath for ur response ! NOT!🤨
@autumnj2001 @AnnCoulter Of Course He’s guilty! Its another one of the Perks of “White Male Priviledge”!!!  Guilty, no Due process , and of course Always the Liar! So upset I wasn’t born a white male! Dammit they have all the luck nowadays! 🙄🙄🤔😣🤨
@jf400 @AnnCoulter @trumps_feed The man doesn’t need to apply demwit ,he was chosen! I’d like to see the background check on both accusers ! Kavanaugh has had 5!! They have had ZIP! So ordering a 6th seems logical &amp;zero for the women? NOT!FBI needs to investigate accusers!Demwit Motto “Resist,Lie,Delay,Repeat!”
@ColorInFusion @AnnCoulter This is none of the above ! This is a last ditch effort 2delay &amp; derail a decent qualified Supreme Court Justice until after midterms! So obvious it’s unreal! Demwits last trick in their dirtbag &amp;it’s awful this circus is taking place! Demwitted motto-Resist, Lie,Re-lie,Repeat!
@RBPahlka @soledadobrien Idiotic remark! Don’t quit ur day job to be a fortune teller or physic ! “ she’s not going anywhere either !”
@mcraiser @KimStrassel He’s has FIVE FBI background checks ! My god the man was a virgin into his early to mid 20’s!!!
@mcraiser @KimStrassel He’s absolutely extremely qualified ... and has been a pillar of society, the way this all happened between the circus in the hearing,then a last ditch effort 2 delay is digusting! Destroying a mans life , good name &amp; Career for a political agenda is irreprehensible! Sickening!
@mizner_cheryl @KimStrassel And she never said she went to a bedroom in the house unwillingly .. we’ve all been there .. she’s full of crap and a dem witted agenda plain and simple! FBI needs to do a background check on her!!
@cowboy0603 @KimStrassel Dem wit!
@t_awnya @KimStrassel We know the truth ! Resist and delay ! It’s more than obvious .. apparently the entire Dem witted party &amp; Feinstein weren’t too hasty to find out the truth ! Explain that now ?!!!
@plkarter @KimStrassel I agree with you!! Dr Ford needs a background check then she needs to be charged with purgery ! 15?! In the bedroom at a house party drunk? She didn’t mention being in there unwillingly ! Poor Judge Kavanaugh ! The Dems are treating his man inhumanly but will glorify MS13!!Fools!
@meghanauthor @KimStrassel Exactly .. FBI needs to do a background on her then catch her for purgery!
@Kymholcomb1 @KimStrassel Why was she in the bedroom ?! Hmmmm wanted to play Grown up party girl at 15?!!! She is the one that needs a background check!!!
@mcraiser @KimStrassel Call them for what ?! A non crime non punishable , non proveable, I think they need to look into Dr Fords background !! They’ve done 5 on Kavanaugh! I had a TS with an SBI &amp; yes they talk to every neighbor, go to ur high school, talk 2 friends &amp; teachers! FBI needs a Ford Bio!
@lnole @LegalMediaWire @KimStrassel I’m done recall her mentioning she was unwillingly taken to the “ bedroom” at the party?!! She should have gone to “White gloves &amp; party manners” first ! Smh! Dem wit!
@KimStrassel The only thing so far revealed is that Judge Kavanaugh was surrounded partying alcoholic hoes! 15?!Now we’ve all been 2 house parties. My question would be was she unwillingly drug to a bedroom at a house party!? Sounds like she wanted to play Ms Party girl &amp; traumatized herself!
@Carlstroud8 U mean Kavanaugh ? My opinion so far was Brett went to school with some alcoholic hoes!! Hopefully people will judge them in there professions and use there admitting drunken promiscuous behavior against them in their careers! Dem wits always have a double standard ! It’s sad! 😢
