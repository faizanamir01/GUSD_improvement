@SenateGOP Great job done. Best brains at work.
@kbentil But you agree that the tape is also linked to the AWW by-election violence. Is time we don't under look at serious issues of this nature (tape). You should rather be calling for the investigation into the authenticity or otherwise of the tape.
@ZNEWSNET Too bad and undemocratic. The rights of the citizens must be respected and protected
@giftyandoappiah Good news
Hahahahahahaa 😂 😂.  This guy has not eaten ooooo.  He is still crying. https://t.co/lyHtpbxXj0

@Joy997FM Great move and came at the right time. I wish the commission well.
@Citi973 The minority didn't do well at all. It is very unfortunate and so shameful. "Bloody widow" comment from the minority saddened me.
@Citi973 What is the meaning of that?  I believe minority can help us in a better way to put the government on its toes to perform better. This walking out protest wouldn't help anyone.
@GHOneTV It was great and fantastic. Just that undesirable elements are too much in the system.
@giftyandoappiah In fact ooooo. Politicians will put this country into chaos one day if we don't stand up and speak against these uncivilized and uncultured acts.
@JOYNEWSONTV Too bad for our innocents babies. God is in control.
@giftyandoappiah Never, we should not try and at all. We should even not discuss at all. We will joke, our streets will be flooded with crazy people, especially the youth. They will not use it for the intended purposes, but rather abuse it.
@JOYNEWSONTV Is not good for a Christian home and should be condemned and banned immediately. I support the move by the Pentecost Church and other churches should follow same.
@Absa Africa's future is attitudinal change.	We are where we are because our of our attitudes. We must change for good.
@JOYNEWSONTV All we want is our Three Taadi Girls. Anything else without the girls is nothing.
@giftyandoappiah Too bad. Can't we as a nation find a  lasting solution to this problem? We need to do something now to stop these preventable deaths.

@NAkufoAddo @Citi973 @kaessuman @GhanaPresidency You really did a fantastic job for the whole of Dagbon. The spirit of the ordinary Dagomba is with you in all your endeavors. You are a man of action. We appreciate that. God bless you.
@Citi973 We want nothing but the arrest and prosecution of the killers. I wish them well. We will not remember you because we can never forget you. Rest well Mr Ahmed Husein-Suale
Oh my God! What kind of church is that?  I'm totally confused and lost completely. https://t.co/TI5rBQlxh1

@JOYNEWSONTV What are they going to say apart from what the police are been telling the public? I don't see anything significant there. 	#BringBackOurGirls
@Citi973 Is a good move to reduce Child Abuse cases by teachers.  I support the decision of the GES.
@JOYNEWSONTV Eeeeeiiiii that's serious. Stabbing someone to death because of meat?  I'm short of words and no comment.
@Independent The family should be given serious protections. That's serious allegation and should be given serious attention it deserves.

@giftyandoappiah I can't wait to see him in Ghana.	My questions to him is, 	1. what development magic agenda is working for China? 	2. What is China's plan for Africa in the next ten years?
I’d like the #PowerTo make a difference when it comes to #GenderEquality. Looking forward to learning more at #WEF19, thanks to @BofA_News. Appointment of more women into responsible positions.
@Citi973 @benkoku @anasglobal What's Anas' view on RTI bill?
RT @Joy997FM: Is the National Anthem a patriotic song?		Vote, Retweet and share your comments.	#JoySMS
@Joy997FM In words in the song are so powerful, inspirational, motivational and encouraging. It's a patriotic song.
@JOYNEWSONTV Yeah for sure we are already seated and watching you live.
@giftyandoappiah The Ghana Police Service and other security agencies need the support of the public to arrest those undesirable elements and bring them to book.
@realDonaldTrump Eeeeeeeiiiiii.  Trump Trump! Always heating hard. Anyway, Kudos to you and your economic management team. You are doing well.
@stanleykwenda @ManUtd Rest in peace.
@JOYNEWSONTV Is it 'selected' or 'elected/elect' because there was nothing like voting? The gods did their selection.
@USEmbassyGhana Hmmmm. So sad. It is difficult to say 'Rest In Peace" It is so painful
@JOYNEWSONTV Who cares?  Monkey has no business doing in the dancing hall of dogs. Manchester United still the only team to rely on.
@JOYNEWSONTV Congratulations to the good people of Dagbon. We are proud of you. Peace Development should now be on top of our daily activities.	Long live Dagbon, Long live Ghana.	I'm a proud Ghanaian today.
@Citi973 Who killed Tiger Eye undercover investigator, Ahmed Husein?	#AskKennedyAgyapong

@Citi973 @NAkufoAddo Below the belt. We should be serious the way we discuss this menzgold issues. This issue is very serious and is about life and death. If we don't take this issue back from the politicians I'm afraid it will be difficult retrieving those monies.
@JOYNEWSONTV I'm not happy the way we are now handling the Menzgold issues. This issue is very serious and is about life and death to the depositors. If care is not taking to take this issue back from the politicians and discuss it substantively it will be difficult retrieving those monies.
@Graphicgh Below the belt.
@guardiannews Good move. May, I wish you well and success in your efforts to serve your people and serve them well. Kudos to you and your team.
@JOYNEWSONTV Good news.
@Citi973 Now that you are talking biblical. First, you were talking or speaking in tongues. I wish you well in your efforts to retrieve your money.
@tv3_ghana It has been long overdue. That guy should be arrested immediately and depositors money retrieve back to them.  We will scare away the wolf 🐺 before we advice the goat 🐐.
@JOYNEWSONTV It has been long overdue. That guy should be arrested immediately. Customers' deposits are our major concern now. 	We will scare away the wolf 🐺  before we advice the goat 🐐.
@giftyandoappiah Great move from the government. Kudos to JOYNEWS for exposing the rots in the company.  We the people of Ghana are most grateful to you.  Well done
@JOYNEWSONTV And who cares, or whose business is it for you to sleep? When you invested into Menzgold and you were sleeping and snoring did you announce that you were sleeping? 	Give us peace please.
In Africa with every meeting with a prayer, lie throughout the meeting and end with prayer. https://t.co/zp8Xdjdubu
@Citi973 May God forgive her.
@djswitchghana @ClarenceHouse You do it all DJ SWITCH

@Citi973 Wow that's fantastic news. I wish them success in the game
@TIME Hahahahahah 😁😁😁😁
@CNN Wow, I really miss this lady (Celine Dion). I wish her well in all her endeavours.
@Citi973 No problem, after all tit for tat is never a sin.
@Citi973 They (the minority) has track record on that. Is normal to them. But they should know that the fact that is a normal practice of them does not mean it is normal. I wish them well
@peacefmonline We thank God for his life. Wishing him well
@cnni Too much and a disgrace to the nursing profession. She should be punished severely to serve as deterrent to others. Sacking her shouldn't be the option.

@Kojoanan Complete the footbridges for us.
@Citi973 What prevented you from updating us on the steps and progress you were making towards the completion of the footbridges?
@Citi973 But the salaries and allowances are not share properties from the same work we all did.
@Citi973 Too late from you Mr Minister.	I strongly believe is because of the public protests that is why you are now making such gargantuan promise. 	RTI bill must be passed now.
@Citi973 That's why we need RTI passed.	You people in authority always keep public information from the public. You are now paying for keeping such information from the public.
@JOYNEWSONTV With this his unguided and unfortunate comment and you still call him deputy minister? That man is not fit to be with the information team of the government. The earlier he is taken off the place, the better it will be for us. Always misinforming the public.
@JOYNEWSONTV Too bad.
@IDEGGhana Received and have downloaded it.  Thanks so much

@IlhanMN @stelladamasus Congrats. Well deserved
@JOYNEWSONTV What decision he regrets taken in any budget (s) and that doesn't go down well with plans? ie any of the budgets he presented to parliament. What is the major challenge (s)  he believes any finance minister is luckily to face as a manager of the national coffers?
@GHOneTV Team koose
@FoxNews Wow
@cnni What moral training did you give him before he went ahead to do this inhuman act? You the mother have failed in your child upbringing responsibility. Apologize to the good people of America.
@realDonaldTrump Well noted. Thanks so much for the reminder.
@JOYNEWSONTV Five years is too much. Four years will be OK. Is loud able call and should be look at by all the stakeholders in the education sector.
@peacefmonline We pray for so
@ewuramaboat @JennyBlastMusiQ @eshunonline We are waiting for it with keen interest.
@TheIsraelLaryea @ohemengtawiah What at all is the authority doing to stop that preventable deaths? We need to get serious in this country. How can innocent lives be getting lost like that on the same stretch of the road? I don't think far.
@Citi973 Another wasted expenditure.
@FT Is a misplaced priority.
@GHOneTV A woman
@anasglobal @ossoff Great work done. Kudos to you and your team.
@Citi973 This man should seat down and rest. He wants to embark on a journey he can't finish.

@tv3_ghana I was sad. She did well, because it is not easy keeping yourself in a keen competition like GMB to this stage. Experience does not only means success, but also failures. She can make good use of experience gained for real life situations. I wish her well in all her next endeavors
@mbrooksrjc Rest in peace
