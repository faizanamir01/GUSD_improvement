We passed #HR8 today because we’ve seen too many parents mourn lost children &amp; children mourn lost parents. We passed it because Americans took to the streets &amp; demanded action. And we will keep fighting until those streets are free of gun violence &amp; the mourning can end.
After nearly a decade of GOP ignoring massacres &amp; daily gun violence, their only contribution to #HR8 was a reminder that they can’t do anything without scapegoating immigrants. And then almost all of them still voted to leave our communities vulnerable to gun violence anyways. https://t.co/hH4RB2HiGZ
We have watched bullets tear through the safest enclaves of our communities &amp; country. We have watched elected officials offer their thoughts as a shield to students gunned down in classrooms &amp; worshipers killed in churches &amp; temples. Today, we stop thinking &amp; start acting. #HR8
More than anything else, universal health care is about a government that believes no one should stand alone in their time of deepest need. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor #MedicareForAll, as we work to make good on our belief that health care is a right in this country.
There is no emergency on the border that will be solved by an expensive, ineffective wall. We can fix our immigration system, provide relief to Central American refugees &amp; live up to our proud American values, but only if GOP &amp; POTUS stop fearmongering and lying about immigrants.
The American health care system is rife with inequities that have no place in the richest, most powerful nation on earth. Today I am proud to add my name to the new #MedicareForAll bill being introduced by @RepJayapal because I believe it is a strong roadmap for our path forward. https://t.co/jGLqONIEcG

22 immigrants have died in ICE detention over last 2 years. 2 kids died in CBP custody in the last 2 months. 15,000 migrants kids are held in custody. Donald Trump is right that we face an urgent, horrifying humanitarian crisis. He just leaves out the part about him creating it.

The self-proclaimed party of ‘patriotism &amp; strength’ is willing to shutdown the American government because they’re scared of being tweeted at by a bully who gets his marching orders from the hosts of Fox &amp; Friends.
Guns kill people. In fact, they killed nearly 40,000 Americans last year alone. 40,000 American families have an empty seat at their holiday table this year because a bullet took a loved one’s life. We can stop this suffering. We just choose not to. That changes on 1/3/2019. https://t.co/C7N6I8QsCQ
Senate passed CR without a single objection. House could likely pass it with a veto proof majority to keep the government open. Which means Paul Ryan is choosing to end his career in a government shutdown to satisfy President Trump.
A criminal justice system that perpetuates cycles of incarceration, entrenches racism &amp; penalizes poverty is a stain on American soil. First Step Act moves us closer to promise of equal justice but our next steps must address mandatory minimums, bail reform &amp; access to legal aid.

Finally - from providers to policymakers - listen to mothers. Childbirth is a feat impossible to imagine for those of us who do not personally experience it. Even for those of us who have held a loved ones hand thru it. Listen to mothers. #MaternalJustice.
Have also been heartened to hear of #MaternalJustice collaborations going on across country. In my home state of MA leading doctors, hospitals, patients, advocates and public officials come together to dive into the issue and force progress.
Research is the key to progress. Over 1/3 of states aren’t studying maternal deaths. Undertaking these studies could make a huge difference to families in America - including those involved in the 50,000 potentially preventable near-maternal deaths each year. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/dY5ofrE5MD

And we must be mindful that there is one group bearing the brunt of our insufficiency here -- mothers of color. Follow groups like @BlkMamasMatter and @SisterSong_WOC. Listen to their voices, elevate their message, commit today to support their efforts. #MaternalJustice
No matter the political climate, raising awareness on matters &amp; speaking up makes a difference. Our successful effort last year to stop #Trumpcare proved that. The more #MaternalJustice stories shared, the harder it is for any elected official to look away. https://t.co/mk0RA5qtTV
We need more support for the House bill. Encourage any and all - especially in Republican-led districts - to contact their reps and ask them to co-sponsor HR 1318. #MaternalJustice is not and should not be a partisan issue.
The @HouseCommerce held a hearing on reducing #MaternalMortality in Sept. We discussed @HerreraBeutler’s bill &amp; the importance of addressing racial disparities plaguing this issue. @doccrearperry &amp; @4Kira4Moms shared their impactful work in ending this inequity. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/FCSA6MQZmd
Conversation moving forward should include: expanded access in rural or underserved areas, boost in funding for community health centers, addressing cost drivers like price of Rx drugs, a profound investment in mental health - the list goes on. #MaternalJustice
But access isn’t enough if care is unaffordable. Rising deductibles mean even w/insurance new parents can be handed a several thousand dollar bill on their way home from the hospital. Maternity care is costly care, which makes price critical to #MaternalJustice
Addressing the gaps starts with protecting gains made. 9.5 million previously uninsured women gained health care coverage under the ACA, growing the coverage rate for women of color to 2x the rate of women overall in 2013-2015.  #MaternalJustice
The statistics are staggering and speak for themselves. Today, 45% of births are covered under Medicaid. From 2014-2016, infant mortality rates declined in Medicaid expansion states + increased in states that refused to expand Medicaid coverage. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/aqPk64UPH3
Finally, no way to advance #MaternalJustice w/o protecting gains made in health care by ACA -- whether guaranteeing maternity care or expanding Medicaid. Allowing this progress to be rolled back would have dire consequences.
.@SenBooker @SenGillibrand and @SenKamalaHarris have been leading legislative efforts in the senate as well. Commend the attention they've brought to #MaternalJustice.
My colleague @HerreraBeutler intro’d legislation that would support states in researching maternal deaths &amp; identifying solutions for #MaternalJustice.  Has 180+ bipartisan cosponsors in the House which is fantastic news. Needs more GOP support to cross finish line. https://t.co/ZD1nnAz9IP

While I appreciate state-level efforts to make #MaternalJustice a priority - CA has made great strides with inequity in maternal care, and my home state of MA is studying autopsy reports &amp; medical charts of those who suffered maternal deaths - we must do better.
Hard truth is that this issue is bigger than a health chart. It's about how + why the voices of black patients are discounted or denied. Not a phenomenon limited to health care by any means - a societal stain this country desperately must address. #MaternalJustice
There is no excuse for the lack of organized data surrounding #MaternalMortality and its racial disparities. Black women are still 3-4x more likely to die from pregnancy complications, even when you control for socioeconomic differences.  #MaternalJustice https://t.co/t91U32uTdg
No excuse for the richest nation on earth to have the worst rate of maternal deaths in the developed world. None. #MaternalJustice
Advocacy groups like @MomsRising @MamasConPoder @DC_AMCHP @ACOGAction @BlkMamasMatter @MarchofDimes @NPWF and @everymomcounts have done important work to shine light on this issue and offer real policy solutions. Congress needs to catch up. #MaternalJustice
Lack of access to affordable prenatal, maternal, &amp; postpartum health care. Lack of access to maternity coverage prior to ACA’s enactment, lack of research, lack of attention paid to disparities in health care — these inequities are compounded in a myriad of ways. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/xeRXXN9OQ0
It's an injustice of unacceptable proportion that the richest, most powerful, most innovative nation on earth would allow skin color to impact something as profoundly universal as pregnancy and childbirth. We can - and must - do better. #MaternalJustice
In 2014, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination urged the US to eliminate racial disparities in the repro health field &amp; collect data for #MaternalMortality - yet no systems exist. We need #MaternalJustice before more mothers fall btwn the cracks.
Black women are 243% more likely to die from pregnancy or childbirth related causes than white women. We can’t address solutions to #MaternalMortality without discussing solutions to the systemic racism buried deep within our nation’s health care system. #MaternalJustice https://t.co/5mYJHUHVIW

Senate GOP has waited years to update its own sexual harassment policies, months to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act &amp; two centuries to appoint a single woman to the Judiciary Committee. But can't wait a few days for the FBI to investigate Dr. Ford's allegations.

2 out of 3 sexual assaults are never reported. Might have something to do with the fact that for every 1,000 rapes, 994 perpetrators walk free. And the fact that men in power make statements like this one. https://t.co/IHw3BfM2la
