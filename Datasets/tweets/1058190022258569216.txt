@EPN You could make initiative to US @DHSgov @SecNielsen to discuss shared participation would give your career strength for your election. Its a win to participate in jobs and international policy with America .@POTUS @Scavino45 @SteveScalise @GOPLeader
@EPN A unique opportunity could benefit your countries economy as well as solve solutions to the border issue. This could offer Mexican jobs to create this shared border perimeter, you could offer migrants huddled at the border jobs to work in wall creation

Challenge accepted Twitter for your subversive efforts to meddle in the united states political arena , elections, political and much more dangerous threat to the republic implications posed by social platform networks to further propaganda favoring only one side of any topic
the main take away from this is clear, Twitter is scared of republicans and conservatives they know we will dominate debate and destroy the leftist narrative of their leaders , puppets and media whores. Verified
but not leftist voices, new account creation presents you people who you can follow, out of the 100 (tested 5 times no dif) all suggested people to follow were all democrat supporters or leftist propaganda tools.Twitter we can confirm is a Censorship propaganda publisher
congress committee and change your claim to you do with prejudiced bias filter and suppress voices that shatter your leftist narrative propaganda. I also verified other accounts not my own that are shadowed and the politicians don't know their message is being suppressed
trouble and i as others were sinking their nonsense self congratulatory parade of denial. well twitter i kept screen shots to verify to congress committee your violating your platform vs publisher declaration in which you should have to go back to ...
who will put pressure on the deep state politicians especially conservative or anti establishment propaganda puppets such as liberal media and bought politicians. this was now the 3rd time they suppressed this week 3/5 days when schumer and pelosi were in ..
This confirms we are getting to them if they have limit accounts to reduce facts and suppress damage control for their liberal puppets @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi . Apparently shadow blocking temporarily except people that follow you is how they limit those
Well twitter that was predictable, after going after @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi and kicking their as$ for a few hours Twitter decided to limit account in order to suppress negative schumer and pelosi prime time exposure.
@Mike_Beacham horrific skin over alien job or what, alien reptilian insurgents need to do better LOL 🤣

@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump Another avenue can achieve this is using existing pentagon funding by only using Veterans and veteran orgs this allows military and pentagon fund shuffle of 5.7 billion easy from 700 billion appropriated in budget. They cant say NO to veteran job creation!
@Scavino45 @realDonaldTrump If you look into it, this is exactly how Obama built the Afghanistan wall and the Jordan wall projects, not even for Americans. they used emergency declaration E.O.
@Scavino45 A solution to stalemate. Negotiations live on TV, @potus invited to sit in are the families members of murdered Americans impacted by democrat actions.   This removes demonrats &amp; Media dismissal of American deaths. in their face on live TV .

@benshapiro that consists of anti male hate speech.
@penelope7usa we have a Gitmo Cell reserved for him already
@OANN @YouTube that's not misconduct, that's obstruction of justice with intent to conspire to subversion in ongoing investigation which he directly benefits from destruction of evidence to commit fraud, there by becoming a federal obstruction indictment to commit felony.
@BreitbartNews Nah America Passes, he will be in Gitmo by then. Cell 249c
@AnnCoulter hehe lol Sneaky but true ;-)

@acrimony616 @politico @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi Perhaps , however a illegal immigrant hung on the nightly news each day will definitely make an impression to incentivize these illegals to at least behave while being illegally here. or their time here will be very short no prison next day Live hanging.

@starfang3 @prageru no new amendments can be ratified till the 14th is resolved for the constitution to be secure and properly procedural by the constitution requirements of its integrity of responsibility to the states of and which are united in union that protect the bindings of "We The People"
@starfang3 @prageru and then ratification renewal of every amendment after the 13th has to be taken as record by congress because technically by constitution requirements and congressional procedure, all legislation after the 13th are invalid and just assumed legal by ignorance
@starfang3 @prageru and the same with the war powers act will be rescinded as reverted power to the constitution and the people closing the loop hole . Ironically the traitorous loyal factions who subverted the republic are still within .. the democrat party 200+ years later. soon to be resolved
@starfang3 @prageru to be removed from minutes of congress sessions. But the proof is there in you cant locate the ratification signatures for the 14th amendment because they never existed and everyone just assumed it was , but library of congress shows its not . but this will be resolved by Q
@starfang3 @prageru checked on current all Congressional open bills knows this but no one has the guts to challenge any of it..then in 1912 before Jekyll island Fed creation and the IRS tax theft organization creation Prescott bush lobbied for the mention of 14th amend still open ..
@starfang3 @prageru and then this created the conflict of the 14th amendment never being rattified yet remains open discussoin in teh house but was tabled to never be allowed to open already open bills so it sits secretly open violating our rights . every speaker and congressman who historically...
@starfang3 @prageru Had Lincoln been able to revert the war powers act many things like the NADAA, Patriot act ,federal reserve and IRS and secret FBI CIA could never have been created because that power would have remained within congress as it was designed to be by the founding fathers.
@starfang3 @prageru then 4 days later John Alexander the traitor Zionist assassinated him to keep the new war powers act open to take the country and constitution hostage for the Zionist agenda. which is the way it remains even to this day and how the patriot act and others are allowed to be used.
@starfang3 @prageru if Lincoln only knew that's how our debt to banks exists hundreds of years later because of that loan still today , he would be horrified that it was his action he didn't want to even take the money, and that would hold the republic indebted to England for another 300 years
@starfang3 @prageru of the debt but this was the vehicle that was used to undermine Independence and keep the British entangled into the independence. Lincoln stated his biggest regret being forced into that debt as it  undermined our republic.
@starfang3 @prageru .. looked like that was the primary concern but history is documented in the house of congress if you dig into what was being fought behind the main talking points you see what it actually was about. you know .. just like today's politics Lincoln couldn't get out of the payback .
@starfang3 @prageru in the days before the south demanded only the north pay their own debts not the entire state collective as most western states had nothing to do with it and the south it was used against. slavery was used as a issue for the 14th amend being voted on at the same time so it ...
@starfang3 @prageru wrong, look in the last weeks congres tabled budget bills and comments show the fight about debt slavery issue was a way to shame the south into overlooking the huge debt being added to the budget , and that's when  hell broke loose. The south refused

@DocRockk @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS not based in reality - republican rinos on the deepstate take praised his appointment- Patriotic GOP opposed Mueller's corruption career before they appointed him. His past career improprieties crimes covered up &amp; was accomplice to. 	nice try on spin! FAIL
@rocketgoldstar1 @jeremyherb @POTUS @TGowdySC @RepGoodlatte @JudicialWatch @FoxNews your ignorance is epic for a liberal indoctrinated idiot. Those are absolutely ineligible recusal conflicts, not special appointment to the position. while being implicated directly selling Uranium to Russia a foreign nation secretly a treasonable crime. 4/4
@soledadobrien @brithume @POTUS doesn't pay attention to foreign agents posing as journalists in @fakenews. don't flatter yourselves Constantly Not News		Creepy TDS Obsession in thinking your more important to @POTUS like your showing is treatable and sad.. seek help @soledadobrien

@QuorumCall @JeffFlake Please, FLAKE's name says it all. reflects his inaction, uselessness in congressional session @JeffFlake for a subversion undermining agent for his deep state accomplices before he leaves session. They aren't even trying to hide their improprieties anymore.
@RichardHaass @QuorumCall Just looking at your tweet i could tell you are a CFR anti American subversion agent neocon. Did you ask the Syrian leader for assistance.. doubt it. The USA doesn't support illegal invasion forces for the CFR anymore. @JudicialWatch @POTUS @StateDept
@jeremyherb A compromised Mueller. former FBI director (conflict), James Comey's Boss (conflict2), Career ties to DOJ (conflict3), and a accomplice into Uranium 1 scandal. Mueller shouldn't have been near the probe @POTUS @TGowdySC  @RepGoodlatte @JudicialWatch @FoxNews
@RepAdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff - America doesn't negotiate with terrorists like your demonrat sedition co conspirators. You and other sedition accomplices in the subvert "The President", will not extort @POTUS into your will. #ShumerShutDown
@RepAdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff wants to obstruct justice against a compromised Mueller. former FBI director ( conflict), James Comey's Boss (conflict2), ties to DOJ (conflict3), and also a accomplice into Uranium 1 scandal. Mueller shouldn't have been near the probe @POTUS

@JedediahBila suspicious tho first a deep coma then instant death, perhaps there is a toxin being brought over the border recently to san diego, you should dig deeper into this suspicious tragedy. there is probably more to this story then shows on the surface.
@HeubelR @SteveScalise @reddit WRONG. prove you talked to 60 percent of 325 million people to be able to claim nonsense.	%99.99 percent of US voters just surveyed, believe democrats are socipathic liars and should be held for psychiatric evaluation  for TDS		you believe my poll too right?

@theblaze ok lets take stock, Beto O'rourke lost the senate bid and now also loses his Congressional seat 0/2		but now plans promotion to undermine national security and Texas border protection. 		How stupid is this guy? who ties his shoes for him? 		0/2 buddy quit now

@BreitbartNews she instead hides her skeletons in the guest room , of which there are plenty.Why would Americans vote for a career paid liar that pretends to be an actor on TV? The better the actor, the better they lie ;-) Pass 2020
@bomba_chica @theblaze Absolutely it will, is already been penned and sealed ready for serving.
@BillKristol America doesn't negotiate with terrorists and traitors like you or Mueller you should know that already @BillKristol , especially if you are indicted with Mueller for Uranium One treason and MORE.	US Constitution is coming for Meullers treason crimes shortly
@BreitbartNews so.. google made a fortune off child porn? Sick, Indict them today.
@DailyCaller unlikely, look forward not a single bill passing the house this year. now we @gop are a BORDER WALL to @dem demonrat resistance 	Block all house democrat initiatives @POTUS  @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @GOP , right guys ? Together we stand united the democrats  fall

@foxnewsradio @DanaPerino @ChrisStirewalt @ApplePodcasts Lets not forget all of Obama and Bush's sealed secret pardons the last week of each of their presidencies. dig into those @ChrisStirewalt
@MikeBastasch @DailyCaller "Pelosi, who’s expected to be elected House speaker in 2019" not so fast there Pelosi. You will have a floor challenge and you only hold 46 if they all show up.
@mskathyeotey @ChrisCuomo @POTUS no no no i didn't say Obama, i would have to say the most corrupt and lazy one, but im sure his  treason trial is making him work now LOL at least while not in his cell

@SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader @SteveScalise @HouseGOP @RepLizCheney @RepTomEmmer @USRepGaryPalmer @RepMarkWalker @RepJasonSmith to get enough GOP and new incoming democrats which is already 21   democrats known to be willing to oppose her , and get them to vote in a  GOP speaker, for the first time in history this is achievable.
@SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader @SteveScalise @HouseGOP @RepLizCheney @RepTomEmmer @USRepGaryPalmer @RepMarkWalker @RepJasonSmith she does not have (by CNN and their own polls of members) enough votes if  they all show up to congress on Jan 3. Your leadership can steal the speaker chair from her for the next session if in the next 4  days you actually be patriotic and honorable
@SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader @SteveScalise @HouseGOP @RepLizCheney @RepTomEmmer @USRepGaryPalmer @RepMarkWalker @RepJasonSmith If you had any honor or wanted redemption for your failures to accomplish the president and "we the peoples" instructions this session , why are you not attempting to claim the next speaker role away from pelosi and the dems?

@LisaMarieBoothe @StanSheriff Jose Aistimuno -  have you registered as an agent of a foreign nation with ambitions of undermining our immigration policies. @DOJPH Someone should look into this guys intentions.		Great Job Lisa
@LisaMarieBoothe @StanSheriff Jose Aistimuno - his primary goal of pardoning millions of illegal border crossing invading immigrants who violated our borders. He wants to absolve his fellow immigrants and give them citizenship as a reward and bonus for their crime of crossing our border.
@DailyCaller Jemele Hill proving once again all liberals and democrats are racist and anti American .
@LisaMarieBoothe @StanSheriff Jose Aistimuno - You proved my point " Democrats and liberals put up a wall to shield themselves from reality logic and facts...	See WALLS WORK LOL
@LisaMarieBoothe @StanSheriff Jose Aistimuno - your WRONG ! ALL ILLEGAL ALIENS SHOULD BE DEPORTED. Not just the ones with high crimes as you stated. Anyone in the country illegally needs to be deported immediately. No more American deaths from illegals period!

@DailyCaller Irresponsible parenting
@JudicialWatch great job keep up the pressure @realDonaldTrump
@SebGorka Better would be to expose in indictment of Muellers conflicts and criminal inclusion to the U1 investigation and replace him using DOJ and include all demonrat and clinton 2016 election crimes... saves time and finally gets the real criminals @POTUS
Liberals and demonrat supporters have a wall built up to avoid facts, logic and reality... WALLS WORK. ;-) @POTUS https://t.co/VPYF7gdrdU
@BreitbartNews Hey Jim, We know you demonrat supporters are, but what are we?

@DailyCaller What a coincidence that's what we all call Sen. McCaskill for many years. Referring Sen. McCaskill to ethics review committee, congressional oversight investigation and DOJ for potential improprieties while in office. She should have packed her desk and left.
@BreitbartNews NY Times should be required to register as a agent of a foreign nation. Unbelievable
@BreitbartNews has she registered as a agent of a foreign country while attempting to influence from within congress agendas not of American citizens. She doesn't understand her allegiance is to be sworn into for USA and clearly will  need to register soon
