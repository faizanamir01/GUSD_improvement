@PillHard @brendapsalinas All political sides sell fear for votes too, or like Dems will make some seem more oppressed than they really are, or Republicans will state that all gun rights are at risk, when they really aren't. The parties needs to go. They just lie, &amp; divide. I like to think for myself.
@PillHard @brendapsalinas Exactly. Democrats do it for votes. Republicans do it for votes. Independents do it too. It's gross. We should all be #TEAMAMERICA. We will get there one day :) I have faith! Folks like you and I can make happen. We weren't born to all agree, on everything. But we can learn.
@PillHard @brendapsalinas I think both sides need to wake up, actually. We will NEVER EVER come to a middle ground, until parties are cut off. PERIOD. Just my thoughts. Both sides have their skeletons. And I like your sense of humor as well, and I like how we ended up laughing together in the end. 👍🏻
