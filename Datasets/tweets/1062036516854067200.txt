@BeckySmirks She's an old white female she's almost as bad as old white man but not quite that's why she is being harassed
@PattyMurray there's definitely an emergency because all you Democrats have went insane cuz they're definitely is problems down the border that need to be fixed and then you wouldn't give him money for it
@AnnCoulter he should put a stop to immigration. Until we figure out the border situation and we kick out a few hundred thousand or more illegal aliens Lynn then maybe reopen it and make it only a hundred thousand a year for a while
@J_Shantel_Ro @AOC Yeah she just running her mouth because she has somebody to listen to her now if nobody was listening to her and we wouldn't have a problem with her

@J_Shantel_Ro I thought that was just somebody making it up this is actually true
@KamalaHarris the only right you have in this life is to live and die everything else is just the irrelevant and if you do want Medicare for a log you got to have to give up welfare for illegal aliens otherwise there's not going to be enough money there
@PattyMurray well if you would just take a trip down there and talk to the people on the border I think you would figure out that it is a friggin emergency you stupid woman go back to Washington not Washington DC Washington and stay there cuz you're stupid
@charliekirk11 That they didn't get it done
@BeckySmirks @J_Shantel_Ro Well that's good

@RepAdamSchiff yeah shifty shafts you're nothing but a pompous ass I just don't understand why people want to work together yet you just want to keep bringing everybody down to your level which is about as low as a slug
@SenSchumer Stacey Abrams sucks he picked another dud for your response I would rather pick some non-politician would have been better than that go to got some bum off the street

If the Senate and the Congress love this country as much as the president does we wouldn't have any dysfunction but they don't cuz the way they vote you know just because you think you got to have everything your way that it it doesn't always go that way
@PattyMurray now sometimes you actually say something that's intelligent but it isn't very often if you're going to keep fighting then you need to help get the the wall built down there and then you'll actually been done something while you're in the the Senate.
@KamalaHarris what's the deal with looking disgusted when he was talking about getting rid of sex trafficking and drug dealers and cartels you shook your head and said all that must not be going to happen I don't like that they take money away from me and my campaign
@SenSchumer Stacey Abrams of you can call it a speech it was a pretty boring bunch of lies she didn't follow what's going on in the country she said that the you guys the Democrats know the little people better than the Republicans which was false does Democrats only love rich
@RepAdamSchiff yeah but didn't lie you weren't watching the same speech that the rest of the United States was cuz they said it was a really good speech and had some good points to it as high as 80% so you must have had your brains that somehow
@Alyssa_Milano the fordable Care act was a careless piece of legislation that didn't help people that didn't have any money because the policies that you could get work worth a s*** Miss Milano if you were a poor person or somebody that had less money you would understand that
If I hear that word vanity use one more f****** time in conjunction with Trump's wall I'm just going to freaking scream he's freaking Democrats it's not vanity it's a necessity to so that the rest of us in this country can live free and not have to worry about being killed
Mazie hirono Hawaii you should fire that lady because she hasn't stood up or clap for anything that he said not even nothing did everybody out there we need to let Hawaii know that they need to get rid of that woman
Walls work and walls save lives that needs to be broadcast across this country with every freaking Republican or independent that has a Twitter account until these idiots are in the Democratic party get enough input
The Democrats should justthey should just be turned around in their chairs and so we don't have to look at their stupid ass faces cuz they got all these we're not in charge so it's all I got to sit here and listen to him all know that is suck so bad
Democrats doesn't agree with that their Union is strong that's because they're brain-dead they must have had aliens come down from the come from the stars and suck all their brains out evidently
The Democrats should not even showed up at this place because they're just showing what Petty pieces of b******* that they are they all smell so bad it smells just like freaking hypocrisy God they look like s***
economies evidently sucks to the general cries because they're all twisting their tongues and faces and all kinds of different positions because they don't believe what the rest of the world is saying about our country there just dumbasses
Freaking Democrats there's such a bunch of sour puss and Hippocratic piece of s*** just makes me a shame that they're actually there for the people in this country we need to stop this bickering back and forth and get our acts together otherwise we're going to be at odds them
I see pelosi has that sourpuss face like the rest of the white where and women it just makes me a shamed are the women that try to run this country they have no respect for anything anymore when they can't even have a smile
Buzz Aldrin and those world war II vets those are true Patriots and people that should be looked up to in this country not these stupid friggin Representatives that we have in the Senate and Congress we're running out of our vets from war
Every one of those sourpuss b****** and white should learn how to smile or at least don't have a sour puss on their face that is truly disrespectful and it shows that we have women in this country that just don't give a s*** about the rules anymore
@charliekirk11 You tell him Charlie such a crock of s*** it's not even funny

@PattyMurray work together in good faith you guys don't even have a clue what that is I used to like the people from Washington but if you're one of them we got all our always have a problem Oregon's bad enough used to be good
@SenSchumer well you know if Puerto Rico ever get their act together and actually vote to be part of this country you know like another state then I would understand you know the problem with not taking care of him but when they're they've had multiple times to join
@Alyssa_Milano I don't know if you're married Miss Milano but if you if you did have a husband I hope he justsmart enough to keep control of you you seem to be a kind of a loose cannon most of the time
@KamalaHarris I don't know where you live woman but we're not having problems with all that crap anyway and it's only because you stupid assholes keep bringing that s*** up all the time is the reason that it's a problem you guys screwed up every major city that you control

@Jilchrest well you're totally wrong on the 50 rounds cost and $10 more likely it's already erupted around $30 so if you increased it another 50% it would double out to $60 dumb s***
@Jilchrest yeah if this country goes rogue and we have problems with our own military and stuff we're going to be in deep s*** anyway but at least we'll have a chance to defend ourselves and get something to eat so you know your idea raising prices on a mother already high enough 😡😡😡😡😡
Didn't you hear global warming not true women and that it's just what the elite people of the world want everybody to think so it's a good idea you'd never looks good tips on food but the warnings bulshit
@Alyssa_Milano oh that's so special you give a thing to trayvon you know a lot of people have died in this country lady for doing way better s*** than that young man you know I don't have any problem gets young black man but you need to get with the rest of the country rogue bt.
@PattyMurray I hate to say it this country's been trying to save the world for the last 30 years and we haven't been doing a very good job of it so you might as well go to use olive oil and use the gas and let everybody in this generation enjoy it because warming not true
@PattyMurray just another stupid ass from Washington now to chop that state and half and they call you liberals live on one goddamn side leave the other side alone that state would be worth a s***

@PattyMurray far as I'm concerned that they should put up a small fence and this mine it on both sides on the on the Mexican side and on the US side that way if they want to come through there more power to them
@KamalaHarris if you doing the stuff for the children's future you should just step away go back to California and be a prosecutor and she ain't worth a s*** for a senator Miss Harris sleep your way to power lady yeah I can imagine what type of President secret service sex toys

@TheBadDadder @barmore27 I don't know what to differences but I bet you anything that he probably had all over the white house for a treat.
@SenWhitehouse Mr Whitehouse you know I've never seen you saying intelligent thing when you been on any committee around the news it's amazing you even got elected must have been a bunch of stupid people on that state
@PattyMurray people don't lose their houses over wanted to miss payments issues about 6 when they start getting having problems so you still got a while
@KamalaHarris yeah I this just shows you how clueless you are miss Harris a pilot will name be thinking about that when he's flying is helicopter where is playing or driving there wouldn't be in the brain because it is post to be there as their attack not to do that
I think to show solidarity with these 800000 workers that are working for the government we should boycott the super bowl this way list the people there are work with know the rest of the United States is with them sensor saints of trying to screw up the game anyway
it would be nice if there was some millionaire out there that would help these government workers get to the Capitol every day and demonstrate until they open the government maybe this will give these idiots running the house some reason to do it. Open it
Government is broke so we the people need to take care of this ourselves and we need to figure out a way to build this wall whether it's donations or whatever it is and we need to get it done because government has no clue anymore
I believe that we should have some toy designer needs to design a toy that looks like pelosi and have a big boot behind it going up her behind and then we need to sell these and donate all the money to the GoFundMe for the wall just build it ourselves
I believe the veterans in this country need to do what's right for this country and call your representatives and tell him to ignore Miss pelosi and do what's best for the country this needs to be done by every veteran and even every veterans wife and kids
@datchurchonline there is no such thing as discrimination when it comes to stuff like that when people are running their businesses and religion should not even come into anybody's business so tired of people telling other people what they can do with what their own business
@datchurchonline I believe in the right to run any business that you have any way that you like if you do not want to serve somebody you should have the right not to serve somebody I just wouldn't stay the reason I just said I can't do it
I think we need to ship a few more grizzly bears from Montana back to the Capitol and a few of the wolves to that would be good cuz they used to roam back there so they're they're native to the area and I'm pretty sure they would love some jackass meat
Not my speaker not my speaker not my speakerI really don't think that Miss pelosi has a brain I don't know who you know she doesn't use it at the time I think she's so old she's senile I think we need to get rid of her people California get rid of her
I believe people in this country should start saying the same thing that they said about the president about the speaker you're not my speaker you're never will be you are voted in by democrats so you go play with yourself in your vineyard

@SenGillibrand and I don't understand you miss gillibrand because you know you worried about these God dang illegal aliens coming into this friggin country and being separated and when there's kids in this country there being separated all the time by court system
One last comment for Miss pelosi anyway you know the military probably does not like you I don't like what you stand for they fought for years to defeat communism and socialism you think they really want to celebrate with you and your Democrats
All these freaking people went after Steve King for his comments about that they need to go after this freaking Somali woman she's derogatory comments about the Israelis is just as bad and anybody is sociates with her or even works with her should be sensor 2
I love this country been from one end to the other of it but if they can't get their act together and they canceled the super bowl I think somebody's going to get firedif any of these freaking liberals don't think this is a good country and good people they need to go elsewhere.

well at least the GoFundMe things going to work out and we're going to end up to end up building wall for landowners down there and and actually do a little bit job better job because it's going to pay cost less to build it does government is doing it
Shifty shift and fake news is there fast at it again they lying about stuff and don't bologna and telling lasagna and whatever they can come up with besides the truth they're doing it

@SpeakerPelosi I wouldn't give you any other time because you can people are straight-up Dingle balls some car flipping itself upside down and everything mix more logic than you guys do
@SpeakerPelosi I wouldn't take the time to read anything you had to say because you're the one that saying that we can't have a wall because it's immoral but I have walls around my vineyards and I have a wall around my house and that's just to keep myself safe

@starcrosswolf @Jamierodr10 Another reason we need to get rid of some more of these stupid ass judges and get conservative judges in there
@dbongino dumbass liberals either attacked  the Constitution that every freaking thing and they tried to tell us that this is a oh it's a democratic country which we are democratic country but we're also a republic first and we just have Democratic elections
@terryschappert @SebGorka Stupid 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Hugo sara you tell him love your commentary and your you're mine cuz you it thinks instead of just farts like some liberals do
@KamalaHarris really Camille using the native Americans know the native Americans would just take care of themselves like everybody else in this country would have to do you know there's some other native Americans are doing real well maybe they out of help him out
@SenSchumer Schumer are you complete idiot and under mine that all the 1964 ain't doing crap to that just another one of your blame this on that always doing this oh no he's doing thatwhy don't you go be a pain in the ass like in Germany's butt or someplace else
@SenatorDurbin oh boy it's my number one senator Dick durbin hey durbin did you have an original thought today I don't know if you ever do cuz you seem to be following everybody else's way other other people do things
@SenSchumer @SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Chucky Chucky Chucky or you just never learn your lesson I've known a lot of people that lived in New York and you don't seem to be as smart as they are I don't know maybe you ought to retire and let some of the smarter ones
@EliseStefanik @LoConservative @TGowdySC @ewarren I don't think we'll ever have to worry about miss Warren being nominated for presidency because she's too clueless of how normal people are in their life and she would offend	  everybody all the time
@KamalaHarris well if you truly wanted to learn about American people and get their info you need to go to more places besides the far East coast in the far West coast you need to do a few dates in the middle in the middle then he'll learn what American people are all about
@ARmastrangelo Well that's because somebody convinced that idiot lady that there was a constitutional crisis going on with the Republicans and she's doing whatever she thinks she can do to knock the Republicans down
@kathygriffin I'm with you Kathy Griffin you got you had problems with your things you do with the liberal idiots but I got a mother-in-law that has dementia and has that type of problems so I know exactly what you're going through take it easy in take care of that lady
@dbongino Don't worry about it then you're right LeBron is not as good as the king the true king a basketball Michael Jordan because LeBron James played during Jordan's time he wouldn't have lasted very long because he's too soft
@SenBlumenthal I'm sorry mr. Blumenthal but you need to go out to the Saudis and you don't have enough money in your pocket to do that and then why don't even think we got enough money in this country to do that so you can condemn it do whatever you want but they're going Saudis
@realDonaldTrump Hugo president you know I don't think that the liberals like the way you negotiate but that's probably good I hope you get this stuff settled and get it done and get your wall built this country will be so much better off with it. 😉😉😉
@KamalaHarris if you just stick the legislating you know people would actually like you a lot more when you start gone the other way and just basically shot yourself in the foot this is somebody that has been a Democrat Anna and independent and a Republican
@SenatorDurbin God I get tired of you liberal muffins worried about the federal workers now there is actually the laws that he'll help them get money they're already on the books if that's out for a long time and don't use them as a means of pushing your progressive bull Bucky
@SpeakerPelosi @JoyAnnReid doing a town hall with joy Reid's like doing the town hall with the liberal nut of the United States so you're doing it with her you're not trying to get anything done other than one of the more liberal s*** out
@RepAdamSchiff okay I'm almost all the representatives that come out of California or just freaking nuts live down in Oregon we used to call the California oh yeah the land of fruits and nuts you screwed up California bad enough so just leave the rest of the United States alone
@RepAdamSchiff I don't know shifty shift you're the one that likes to lie all the time so you know you pick one of them and figure out which one of them so high in a lot of people tell what they call a little white lies to get their what they want
RT @RealCandaceO: In today’s episode of “Chuck vs. Chuck” @SenSchumer reminds us all 	that the Democrat Party is filled with liars, hypocri…
@DLoesch Cortez is just nuts if she thinks they're going to get that high tax rate it ain't it ain't never going to happen she'll learn that being in Congress for a while that you got to do what everybody wants to do not just what you want to do miss Cortez
@CrudasVerdades_ @vdare @AnnCoulter it happens when you lived a few years and you've been around and you seen elections and people go and come and see what happens like if you haven't lived long enough to figure that out well live a little bit longer and you will learn.
@RashidaTlaib @CrudasVerdades_ P there's no constitutional crisis this is a republic this is not a friggin democracy you have democratic elections
@MichaelAvenatti yeah when you're one to talk you massages pig do ya
@tedlieu Trump shut down that's so original say it again
@RepCummings you're the reason there should be term limits I should have been there a long time ago
@MarkWarner you're the reason they should be term limits
@RepCummings you should be ashamed of yourself people in this country that protected this country don't like the crap that flowing out of your mouth you know you should be talking where you want to get together with people and solve problems not make more problems you moron
@MarkWarner Warner you're nothing but a mean nasty person if you had an original thought comes in your brain and brain would probably explode
@SpeakerPelosi you need to control your people in your freaking house to you know there's what they call oh oh oh ethics stuff imagine that and if your Congress women keep running their mouths they should be censored
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats Hr1 is nothing but a bunch of crap you shouldn't even brought it up you think that there's nothing that can happen to you in this country you can be replaced
@CrudasVerdades_ @vdare @AnnCoulter Years of experience is why I know that
@RepAdamSchiff you just pay attention to the house you shifty shift don't want to hear crap out of you cuz all you do is still bunch of crap
@PoliticalShort @SebGorka It's nice dream but it'll never happen
@RepJoeKennedy my uncle knew John f Kennedy and helped get him elected out of state Oregon I don't see any of his attributes in you I hope you start doing something with your life Democratic stuff just don't cut it anymore unless it's non socialistic
@RepSwalwell I don't know what it is about you I just feel that there's some good in you you're not as bad as you sound on TV he's that good to do something for the country
@RepSwalwell I'm curious are you going to be running for president to as much time as you spend on the freaking TV or trying to do something
@RealMAGASteve Sure glad I don't live in the big city is I had to slap the s*** out of that one
@DLoesch They can come and do whatever they want but it doesn't mean it's going to happenit'll just die and go away because it'll never get then get everything done with it in the Senate
@ShannonBream @FoxNews @foxnewsnight You're so talented Shannon you can even do your show while you're getting your hair done
@RepAdamSchiff Well I hope you guys investigate yourself because it Democrats are some of the most corrupt people in the country and always have been
@RepHankJohnson you're a sick piece of s*** anybody that spews crap like that out of your mouth should be sent to a different country cuz you don't belong here you haven't earned the right to be here.
I hope that the Senate and the house can work things out and be great if they did but the pessimistic side of me says that nothing will get done for a while that's why I think that we're just going to end up in a bunch of bitching and stalemate for two years
@KassyDillon Well she just kind of clueless cuz you have to have PR people to understand what she did was wrong and then it isn't helping her got more problems than you need
@SaraCarterDC @LisaMarieBoothe well these 800,000 people that aren't getting paid just to demonstrate on pelosi's front yard and Schumer front yard I think we would get this taken care of real soon .
@LadyRedWave @POTUS You're so right we're so screwed to have that lady in charge of that cuz she knows she can't do anything so she's going to do everything to screw with the president as much as you can
@vdare @AnnCoulter Pretty scary that these women to go to be empower God save the country these people have no clue what they're doing
@GOPChairwoman @DonaldJTrumpJr I believe that if they don't get any of the wall then they should just pull all the barriers down pull all the border patrol back  and let the crime go and then when the crime gets the point that there's people dying I guarantee you it will get rid of Miss pelosi and Schumer
@RepAdamSchiff You're just going to waste your time shifty Schiff might as well justI truly do not like you because you're not truthful and you're a fake heard those words before the best describe you instead of the president
@SenatorDurbin No durbin he's just doing what's best for the people in the country you have no clue what that is.
@AnnCoulter They don't care whether or not  the facts supported they just don't care about all the people that have been killed raped are human trafficking only care about themselves that's it.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Really newt there's probably one chance in a billion that she would do that because she truly is not a strong woman she's just a old woman that should be back in California best place for her
@MissILmom @Jamierodr10 She's really scared of  her mother or she's just brain-dead and don't know any better
@KamalaHarris Well you take him down there miss Camille they  deserve to be taking down a notch maybe they need to be broke up maybe they're too big.
@SebGorka @MittRomney Only need one word puke or punk
@SenSchumer @LauraLitvan @realDonaldTrump That's because Schumer you're just a weak-minded male individual that should be back in New York where you where you can be with all your liberal friends
@SenatorDurbin @MSNBC @Morning_Joe you're nothing but an old man that doesn't know what the hell is he doing any more he should just stay home and Illinois give up your senate seat let somebody that really wants to do something use it
@NikkiHaley @benshapiro That's for sure not single one of them should get a paycheck until they resolve their problems
@KamalaHarris calories are in this mental health crap is because Bill Clinton during his administration let out hundreds of thousands of freaking people that were in asylums and in mental institutions they just close them
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Because you're a backstabbing slimeball
@starcrosswolf @Jamierodr10 Some people aren't known for their smarts
@benshapiro Yeah such a crock of crap
@parscale @KatrinaPierson @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Set a recording you should give this guy to nothing once he gets into a set of a should get crap
@TitaniaMcGrath @benshapiro Are you just nuts or or do you not have a brain
@marklevinshow That's because Romney is nothing but a two-faced turd
@KamalaHarris Yeah only if you want to break the country stupid
@dbongino You're right you shouldn't expect anything else from mr. Mitt Romney yeah he he should have stayed back in Utah or where we was living can't believe that Utah people actually voted for him
@SenatorDurbin I don't have anything good to say to you you're just a mean nasty old man that should just go back to Illinois
@GovMikeHuckabee nice to see somebody doing something normal in the country these other bigwigs I don't have a clue what normal is
@RealCandaceO You tell him the only thing they're doing the serving themselves
@SenSchumer yeah I hope you get a clue cuz what you been doing this country by stymie and everything is just not worth your time you should just stay home
@HillaryClinton stupid woman you need to stay out of the elections just going to go away
@SenWarren woman you have no clue what you're doing you're going to give money to refugees instead of giving money to save veterans you know they gave their limbs for this country yet you keep doing that and you won't get elected of anything
@NancyPelosi yeah I'll believe that when pigs fly
@SebGorka @tedlieu well you know still cries got to have somebody to clean all or nice big mansions they sure the hell ain't going to do it themselves
@AnnCoulter Yeah I ever every one of them should be putting in jail for aiding and abetting that criminal Court New the federal statute they were aiding abetting.
@RealCandaceO @w_terrence Yeah that'll work I'm sure she'll be more than glad to let you come there and do that 😁😊😉
@KamalaHarris you sure act like you care about all these other things but you have such a negative attitude when it comes to Republicans you need to get over that.
@KamalaHarris You need to give me more money because they have to have bigger facilities you dumbass
@ShannonBream You go girl enjoy that time
@lilibellmia @Jamierodr10 @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi yeah she only cares about liberal people anyway and so she's like a lost cause I hope she doesn't get speaker that would make things a little more interesting
@KamalaHarris if you don't change your attitude about Republican people are in the lost people out here that help get Trump Elected as well just give up your presidential run
@grizzlemeister @Jamierodr10 And she's just a stupid ignorant woman from California that hides behind the walls
@JudgeJeanine @CLewandowski_ @KatrinaPierson @FoxNews The Republicans use religion as a tactic during the 2016 election which worked in their favor the Democrats are already starting to figure out that and there are starting to use religious tactics already because they want that religious vote.
@JudgeJeanine @CLewandowski_ @KatrinaPierson @FoxNews The Democrats are using hardcore tactics all the time and if the Republicans don't use the same type of tactics they're going to lose what are you get what's going to be done to match their tactics
@JudgeJeanine @CLewandowski_ @KatrinaPierson @FoxNews Are the Republicans going to shoot themselves in the foot like they did with with the Mueller investigation or do you think they actually learn from their mistakes.

@kimguilfoyle Nice to see you tweeting enjoy commontery.
@SueBee1410 @SenatorDurbin Democrats seem to cherish immigrants compared to people that live in this country that's not small mine and that's just loving your country and the people in it.
@SenBlumenthal Emoji with mr. Blumenthal she's so worried about it vote Yes and get the wall done.
@marklevinshow Yeah you're right mr. Levine making to deal with Erdogan. It's like making a deal with the devil
@brithume the dams don't realize they're making a big mistake by not helping Trump get the wall cuz they're just going to make it another campaign 20/20
@GeraldoRivera @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Could not have said that any better myself Geraldo.
@SenatorDurbin I hope you don't give him the money for the wall because you just use it as a campaign thing for the 2020 election because the Democrats didn't allow it to happen so he can campaign against you with that all he wants
@SenatorDurbin and why do you choose to inflamed things your kids die every day in the United States and you're worried about two kids from Guatemala and I'll be a little worried about the people in this country that die you dumb
@benshapiro I agree with you 110% he did nothing make our relations with Israel get any better

@NancyPelosi I hope you don't get speaker of the house because anybody as stupid as you shouldn't be in that position now these kids come across Mexico and their parents are like I said if they if you did this in this country they you'd be holding them all in jail
@SenatorDurbin Yeah you're nothing but a horse's ass because it had nothing to do with the border patrol or any that stuff it had to do with the stupid parents bringing the kid all the way across the freaking Mexico you think about that you dumbass
@marklevinshow I agree 100% with you mr. Levine
@FLOTUS @SebGorka @WhiteHouse Love the work you do Melania hope we all have a better year next year and you can keep doing what you do cuz you do it really well.
@ShannonBream Love the eye makeup remover Master whatever-it-is looks good
@HQFOX I believe this guy that you have on the news right now is not as smart as he looks cuz he doesn't look very smart
@HQFOX I believe that if it's redacted did they not release it if they're going to release it they need to release the whole thing we as a people in this country deserve the whole report
@PresidentTrump_ President Trump probably solve the problem maybe but have the Senate all of them not just the Democrats go down and work the border for a few days and have McConnell order them to do this and this should help you get the wall
@HQFOX you know when every border patrol person on the Mexican border tells you that it's a dangerous place and the wall would help knock the danger down and would make their job easier and better to control yeah I don't know what else you got to say you know
@HQFOX James Nichols is a freaking I know he's not an idiot but he's something and it's not nice
@TwoAForever Navigate a few thousand veterans in Britain protest ABC Alyssa Milano Mr Jimmy Kimmel
@SenDuckworth no it's punishment just listen to you Democrats talk about not needing the wall you were all for it a little while ago it's not political its security
@SenatorDurbin well I wish I was as smart as you I could be like a dumpster diver person that lives on the street and probably have a little more sense
@SenFeinstein just another California doesn't care about the little people only cares about herself and California only
@RepAdamSchiff didn't anybody tell you when you were growing up you can't say anything good just don't say anything at all or did you not have parents that taught you anyting.
@JimmyKimmelLive Jimmy you self-righteous putz say one more bad thing about are triple amputee veteranI'm sure we can have a few thousand vets come down and protest outside of your house.
@amcentral yeah we can have about 25,000 vets come down and protest right outside of your home if you don't Leave our triple amputee GoFundMe veteran say one more nasty comment about him and I guarantee it this will happen.
@Jim_Jordan Yeah if you watch that video when he was talking about illegal immigration a few years back sounds exactly like Trump talking
@DanaPerino Must have been watching some football today
@dstanglin He was 200 points under what the average it is to get in to Harvard so it wasn't just because he's so smart
@bjaninemorison @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 You got in there because they felt sorry for him and he didn't have the scores to get into Harvard
@krassenstein @IngrahamAngle @davidhogg111 He didn't have the right scores to get in there you got in there because he was in the shooting they wanted somebody in there

@ShannonBream I love what you do Shannon don't worry about them they're all bunch of crazies anyway
@GovMikeHuckabee That guy is a nut because I worked as a firefighter for years and we never had a problem with color or anyting cuz when you working there everybody has to depend on the other person and we don't care whether there are Hispanic black or whatever
@TitaniaMcGrath @AnnCoulter Sounds like you need an intersection with a straight white male
@NancyPelosi compared to all the billions of dollars that we wasted doing stupid things this is money for the wall is actually a good thing and cheap
@NancyPelosi Yeah it's because of you lady you should think about what you doing this country needs a barrier down there to help stop and help us control him immigration
yeah I don't know why that the Democrats don't give in because and just give him the money cuz they if don't he's going to use this wall thing for again to win the next election in 2020 not smart Democrats
@nikkihaley @benshapiro That's alright Nikki just use that scary-looking that you mean something
Senator McConnell show some cojones today and use the nuclear option if needed
@greggutfeld I think you're in the twilight zone Greg
The Democrats that are in the Senate are two chicken 2 vote for the wall they don't think for themselves anymore they think only with their party then they don't have enough Independence to think for themselves anymore they're just a bunch of lemming.
@MeghanMcCain yeah Megan I think you're a beautiful person I just wish you weren't on The View because those other women sometimes is just nuts
@MeghanMcCain Hopefully it was a misprint and maybe it wasn't then she is the dumbest person in the world
@SexyBlueWave @IngrahamAngle More like a blue puddle he's not going to prison have a good day
@LisaDeP I like the way your mind works it works really similar to mine I have to maybe follow you
@realDonaldTrump Yeah it's sad I wish I could just put a stun fence the whole way that would probably stop everybody
If the dams don't vote for this thing you should use the nuclear option mr. McCall it will solve the problem and will have money for the wall
If the government is shut down it'll be because Schumer didn't advise some of his Democrats to vote for this new bill and holy moly it'll be called the Schumer shut down again
@DerekSaysix @pspoole @TomFitton So true
@SecondLady @VP @WRBethesda So very nice Miss pence good job

@marklevinshow How do US air Force fly cover or for him for a while and if anything from Turkey comes down there just blow it out of here
@PressSec Yeah for Mexico those guys are so good when they want to be
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah I think that it would be a good idea to eliminate the filibuster that way we can get the wall done
@nprpolitics @benshapiro I don't see no problems bringing 7000 troops on we've had him over there for way too long and they should be people that country should be out of control right now if not oh well
@NancyPelosi You're nothing but a older lady that needs to go back to California and stay there that would be the best for you
@realDonaldTrump yeah mr. Trump I think you need to go to the Senate and speak there and try to get done it and I don't think it would be negative may help
@NancyPelosi the letter is fine and he just articulating his version of what the world should be like and it's doesn't align with the president I hope he has a good retirement
@NancyPelosi Yes Miss pelosi I think the only problem you have is it you're thinking that this last minute things going to affect your ability to be the next speaker which I hope is true because anybody was as dense as you shouldn't be in that position have a good day
@SenSchumer Schumer you need to get your s*** together and just go ahead and get your Democrats to vote for this because it don't I think he'll just keep it shut down until he gets his money or should I hope we will
@GovMikeHuckabee @mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump Yeah it's CR crap is for the birds they just need to fund the government but put a little bit of money in that wall and that'll be done with it when everybody can go over Christmas
@NancyPelosi yeah I don't think you're really all that broke up over that Nancy even though you kind of sounds like you are you got all your million so you don't really care
@OutnumberedFNC @LawrenceBJones3 you need to get the GoFundMe guy on your show it be a nice thing to get it publicized a little bit more I think we get to this 5 billion.

@onebigchaz @philipe_the_don @benshapiro it's not discrimination by religion or anything it's just a freaking thing that you can receive refuse to serve anybody in your ability that is owned by you and there is no freaking religious crap involved with it it's just you can refuse that's the way it should be
@AP_Oddities That guy should be put in a stupid hotel because she's not very smart
@philipe_the_don @benshapiro it's not discrimination on their Creed or color or whatever or their affiliation it's just their choice not to serve people they don't want to that's just strictly all it is
@onebigchaz @philipe_the_don @benshapiro No just like the old signs that used to say we refuse service to anyone it is our God given right
@burmooa @philipe_the_don @benshapiro Yeah I know they exist but they don't work cuz you got these idiots take it to court anyway
@RudyGiuliani @DineshDSouza Spot on Rudy keep it up
@SenSchumer Schumer I don't think you know anything about conservatives cuz the statement you just made on this little tweet means you know nothing cuz we want the wall and we want it now and she shut everything down to get it
@MrAndyNgo @benshapiro if I was Scandinavian I think I'd be looking to get some payback over that that's just wrong and they should hunt those dudes down and whoever they were do the same thing as what they did to those girls
@JimSwiftDC @benshapiro well that's Don lemon anyway he's a freaking idiot he shouldn't even be on TV anymore instead of getting rid of the ladies on The View they need to get rid of that dude
@LeahGibbon Yeah this shouldn't be offencive to anybody and you should be able to do this anywhere but it is a little weird those things hooked up to her though
@benshapiro Yeah every state in the nation needs to get some type of law on the books that says we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone and make that a law and then this won't happen anymore
@IngrahamAngle Yeah you better have your tissue when you watch that video these families have lost so much and Gary sinise does a really nice job to bring them all together and give him a little bit of fun
@DanaPerino that's all right short people who have ruled the world at world at times and you have a very unique mine and it works really really well.
@IngrahamAngle Give it time Trump will get it done it's just so take a little bit longer we may have to use some inventive ways of getting money like he should just use a go fund me page
@CarolineGlick @benshapiro @realDonaldTrump It could be good till time will tell find out a little ways down line.
@IngrahamAngle Nice one Laura that's pretty funny yeah he should have been showed like that when he first got hired
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @freedomcaucus God I hope so you guys are just been fiddle farting around all freaking year-long you should have gotten this wall thing done a long time ago for Trump.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump I want a bum like I don't know  	He  just looks a lot like a big huge rat face something and he should just retired be the best thing for the country.
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr I think when the new attorney general gets in there he out of just take that motor report when it comes out and put a seal on it and put it away and call it good and that'll make everybody happy except for the Democrats and we won't have any fallout from it
@dbongino I think that the left must have got to Emmet g Sullivan judge it's just my opinion but something smells bad there
Get some of your ability and your friends to pay for the wall and put a freaking tax on going back and forth through the border after that give them the share of that money until they're paid back simple thing president
I believe that it's the Democrats with lots of money that are screwing around with the market but they can only lose money for so long before they have to start buying something back cuz I don't think they can just keep it up all the time just my opinion
Don't give up president weird we got your back just keep pushing shut him up shut it down if you have to since that's DHS money pulled a freaking people away from the border down there that are really free come out
Schumer and pelosi are both putz people in this country want the wall more than half this country once it and if they don't get their act together and get it done they won't be in power when it comes next election.
go ahead and take the money that you took from El Chapo and all the other freaking drug people that you got money from and use it to fund the wall Hugo president
@kerpen @benshapiro Sounds like it was a total setup from the word get go just to get him.
@cvpayne @DonaldJTrumpJr They need to be broken up and making a little bit smaller companies that got too much power as they are now.
@mjfree @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump yeah you know it's it's Chuck Schumer's problem basically because he's the one that shutting the government down because need 10 votes in the Senate do you get this pass he's the one that's being petty and not wanting the people in this country to be secure
@brithume @jasoninthehouse yeah it looks a little suspicious there when you got molar and call me and mr. Barack Obama yeah this is what happens when you got too much power one spot.
