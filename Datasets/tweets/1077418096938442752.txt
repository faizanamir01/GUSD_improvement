I’m lifelong Republican until 2016, when the party self destructed. Made me clarify my own beliefs.

@DreamsOfNoir @KevinSc86173352 I hear you. I feel it. The President took out my first and second choices for Republican nominee...EARLY!		I paid attention. I voted for him. He wins. We win. The Country wins!		Leftists have bigger problems than the President, who after all, is really another temporary occupant
@DreamsOfNoir @KevinSc86173352 Speaking of getting things done. I got things to do. See y’all later. Good luck Schmitty. Enjoyed the public chat immensely.
