Rising health care costs are a big concern for Utah families and small businesses. That’s why I joined my fellow first-term Senators to urge Senate Leadership to take action on the Health Insurance Tax and prevent more cost hikes. https://t.co/jl6yGyyyJC
Met with the mayors of Provo, Spanish Fork, Salem, Nephi, Levan, and Manti, as well as members of the Provo and Salem city councils, this week. I appreciated hearing about their plans to ensure inexpensive reliable power for their residents. https://t.co/IYAXloH2U6
Given that China has closed many U.S. cultural centers, our government and the schools that enter these agreements, should take a hard look at whether we should continue to allow Confucius Institutes to operate in our country. https://t.co/h5z0gWXpiO
I have serious concerns about how little we know about Confucius Institutes and whether they are part of an influence campaign by the Chinese government to shape the attitudes of young Americans. https://t.co/fDkUDzRQU0

I'll reserve judgment on any potential executive action by the President until I'm able to fully evaluate it, but as I’ve said, I don't believe declaring a national emergency is the right approach. I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limits.
While today's funding bill is far from perfect, it includes critical funding for border security and immigration enforcement, and prevents another harmful government shutdown. I am glad the Senate was able to conclude this unfinished business from last year.
#OTD 149 years ago, Seraph Young became the first woman to vote in the United States—just two days after the Utah Territory passed its suffrage laws. 25 Utah women voted that day, nearly four decades before passage of the 19th Amendment. #utpol https://t.co/mIQYCCfbCq

Speaking with @BoydMatheson now on @kslnewsradio. Listen here: https://t.co/MMS8trls0Q
While I welcome efforts by the administration to reach a political solution in Afghanistan and eliminate ISIS in Syria, I believe that – based on conditions on the ground – we must maintain a sufficient U.S. presence in both places to protect our national security interests.
When it comes to foreign policy, I have been encouraged by the administration’s decisions to support the people of Venezuela and take a hard line against Iranian aggression.
The Trump Administration deserves credit for working to cut taxes and regulations, which have helped boost our economy and raise wages.
He highlighted several critical policy areas where there are opportunities for both parties to work together – including lowering health care costs, reforming trade policies to better protect American workers, and strengthening border security and immigration enforcement.
The president’s speech was strong, well-delivered, and appealed to our patriotism and common values as Americans.

I’m encouraged by today’s agreement, which will put people back to work and make sure they get paid. Both parties must work together in the next three weeks on a final agreement that funds border security and avoids another shutdown.
