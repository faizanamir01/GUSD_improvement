Yunjung Seo: CNN referred to Seo as a student at the George Washington University. LinkedIn profile says she works for the Katz Watson Group, which is a fundraising and consulting outlet. The Katz Watson group worked for 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign called “Ready for Hillary”.
Abena McAllister: We were told by CNN that she is just an “active Democrat”. However, this is much less of a description compared to finding out she is actually the Charles County Democratic Central Committee’s Chair according to her being described by the committee.
Tara Ebersole: Ebersole was introduced by CNN as a former biology professor. However, her LinkedIn profile reveals that her current job description is Chair, Baltimore County Democratic Party and has been since 2016. Husband with Hillary Clinton’s leadership council in Baltimore
Shadi Nasab: Nasab was identified as a student by CNN, however, it has been discovered that she is a Public Policy Intern at lobbyist firm Cassidy &amp; Associates located in Washington D.C. Taking a closer look at Cassidy &amp; Associates financial partners, it’s not favoring Bernie.

The medical community now knows what PTSD is. They also now know that that type of trauma rights itself into DNA 		We have to recognize that the monsters among us ARE us. 		We need to heal as a country. Stop the wars. Stop the self inflicted wounds. 		It’s time to lead with love.
What happened to America? 		We had two World Wars. Enough to shock the crap out of even the toughest person. 		They had untreated PTSD. 		They came home scared and started to justify their medical affliction with fear mongering and warfare. 		The trauma is only 3 generations deep

@dlewicki @HH201707 @realDonaldTrump @MarbleChurch No matter which gods we spoke with. 		Organized religions collected money in large quantities and in order to justify such quantities “places of worship” were erected.
@dlewicki @HH201707 @realDonaldTrump @MarbleChurch Physical buildings were not something most religions started out with. There were ceremonies worshiping those that actually give us life: sun, earth, plants and animals. All these things were respected and worshiped because without those things we would not survive...

Organized religion was enacted in order to give power to those who couldn’t not achieve it by political means.

@wishispower I agree with you but with all due respect I have to say that our nation is way past civil.		I know you see this : our civilization is crumbling. We are being killed softly which doesn’t make it more humane. 		Corporate Terrorists have usurped our ideals for their own gain.
According to Justice Department public records and two former counterterrorism officials, no immigrant has been arrested at the southwest border on terrorism charges in recent years.		End news, my take:		NONE! Get that through your thick fucking skulls you racists MOTHERFUCKERS!
Not only is that an outright lie, but in fact, the figure she cites is based on 2017 data, not 2018, and refers to stops made by Department of Homeland Security across the globe, with 4,000 known or “suspected” terrorists from “traveling TO or entering the United States.”

Congress was built not only to draft the laws of this great nation but also as a stop gap for extremism. 		The average bill passing the House and the Senate and onto the desk of the president is anywhere from 9 to 15 percent. 		And that’s a good thing, in common times.
I just set forth @JeffMerkley We The People: A Blueprint for Our Democracy. 		You will see a ton of plans like this laid bare for you to get excited about the 116th Congress, America. 		You don’t want me to lie to you, do you America? 		Of course you don’t, my dearest America.
A copy of Merkley’s full Blueprint for Our “We the People” Democracy can be found here: https://t.co/BGlatY1RjF
- Ensuring Equal Representation:	Abolish the Electoral College and elect Presidents by a national popular vote.		- Provide a pathway for voting representation in Congress for American citizens in D.C., Puerto Rico, and the territories.
- Require all states to allow early voting for at least two weeks before Election Day.		- Stop voter list purges. #Crosscheck		- Restore voting rights for those who served time for felony offenses.		- Nationwide automatic voter registration and same-day registration.
Protecting and Expanding the Rights of Voters:		- Reinstate the Voting Rights Act.		- Ensure equal access to polling locations and provisions to prevent long lines to vote.		- Institute national vote-by-mail.	Enhance election security.
Eliminating Gerrymandering:		- End partisan gerrymandering by requiring independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for all congressional districts, based on clear criteria to ensure representatives are responsive to their constituents.
-Give public citizens legal standing to sue corporations if the FEC fails to enforce election laws.		-Promote small donor engagement in elections.
Ending Dark Money:	- Pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.	Ensure transparency in political donations.		-Give shareholders a voice in corporate political spending.
Merkley’s blueprint proposes passage of existing legislation—such as the DISCLOSE Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act—and also proposes new bills to fill the gaps necessary to restore our democracy, which Merkley will introduce in the 116th Congress.
“Right now, the privileged and powerful are running the show. It’s time to make sure every American has a truly equal voice in the direction of our nation, and that we have a government that responds to the hopes and needs of working Americans.”
“The ‘We the People’ vision of our Constitution is being corrupted by dark, anti-democratic forces,” said Merkley. “We need to restore our democracy.“
Oregon’s Senator Jeff Merkley today unveiled a sweeping blueprint to restore American democracy, outlining a series of proposals to take on voter suppression, gerrymandering, dark money, and unequal representation in our democracy.

From Sea to Shinning Sea America, that plan has already been put in motion. 		You may not understand or even like everything that comes next. 		It will be rocky, America, oh so Rocky. 		But you will persevere my darling America. You are strong. 		False Prophet’s be damned.

America I know you are strong. 		I have seen the lengths that you will go to carry your tired, your weak, your needy. 		Two to three families in a home. Two to three paychecks to survive. 		Haven’t you had enough, America? Don’t you deserve more?		Of course you do, America.

@Questionor @TravisRuger Enough of the party is a complete toxic wreck. They do no vetting and let complete Shit shows run their state parties. Now they are in the midst of a coop. It’s all a complete mess. Jill is one of the best parts of the Green Party in my opinion but the rest needs work.

@eriatarrka Ingraham claimed that Trump’s assertion that Mexico is “sending rapists” is true, and stated that Mexicans “have come here to murder and rape our people.”
@eriatarrka She fearmongered about Muslim immigrants as “people who have dual loyalties … whether it's the Quran, or the Quranic way of thinking, versus the loyalties to the United States.”
@eriatarrka She asserted that “Middle Eastern countries have got to be told… we’re cutting you off,” questioned why the U.S. should allow Muslim immigration ”knowing that we can't tell if an Islamic individual is going to be radicalized.”
@eriatarrka Ingraham fawned over Donald Trump’s bigoted rhetoric on immigration; she defended his calls for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, and even argued that the ban was “not broad enough,” claiming that she would “go farther” and be “even worse than Trump.”

and the family separation,” Kelly said to LA Times reporter Molly O’Toole. “He surprised us.”		I don’t know which lie to believe. This guy is full of them.
Kelly also rewrote history regarding the administration’s immigration policies, in particular the decision to separate families.	“What happened was Jeff Sessions, he was the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained..
But now, he told the Times, he was caught off-guard by the announcement. “I had very little opportunity to look at them,” Kelly said. “Obviously, it brought down a greater deal of thunder on the president.”
“The thinking was to get it out quick so that potentially people that might be coming here to harm us would not take advantage of some period of time that they could jump on an airplane and get here.”
When the travel ban blocking many people from majority Muslim nations from entering the U.S. was first announced, Kelly told Congress....

@RobertJMorriso9 Well yes Bob, 😂, that is true as well. If we were to have 4.3 million years left some say men would be extinct and women would be asexual. 		My thoughts are we will be lucky to survive the next 100 if all the science is correct.
@Nick_C_C 10 percent of the country is migrants and they are having 25 percent of new births. 		I’m for a better evolution all the way around. That means molding with ALL the amazing traits humanity has to offer. If that means more DNA outside of the my Neanderthal bloodline, I’m cool 😎

...ills for lack of a better word. We have a HUGE Re education of male society to deal with that constitutes men being more accountable to and for men. Those are not “choices” in my book. Now we can go back and forth about what lead to what and with each instance we can discuss..
....buy all this stuff. But hey those are choices and most of those choices can be worked with education. 		What are not “Bad choices” are women who historically have to deal with more sexual harassment, rape, forced marriage to older men, pedophilia and many more of humanities..
...still having 25% of the new births in this country. The United States has a huge overconsumption problem that needs to be discussed but also has nothing to do with the poor. When you judge your countries strength on GDP you will always be producing too much. Someone has to...
Women have had to have more children historically because babies were dying at a much younger age, some as old as infant. In order to beat the odds you had to produce more. We have medical 🏥 advances that make that less likely and yet the less educated in our society are ....
...to read the book Drawdown I believe it’s number 6 that states that in order to save the human species from extinction we need to educate women more. I believe that 💯 as well as the men. Sexually active at the age of 14 and I didn’t know who I was personally till much older.
He lost me when discussing the #Abortion issue in that he said something to the effect that by the time the left and the right were in talks about women’s choice there had “already been a bunch wrong decisions being made.” Now I know what he means by the this and if you were....
So the conversation may have changed after as I haven’t seen the full clip. Also Jordan understands his audience so he may have been placating to them backstage when he used this verbiage. I am in no way trying to make his social media life more hell so please keep it respectful.
First of all, I believe it’s a Womens right to choose. Her body her choice. Men should be invited to table to give their input. At the end of the day women have the last say. They have the Veto power. Where he lost me is his choice of wording. And understand this was back stage.
Now follow me here: He is right and wrong when he discussed this and I do applaud him for at least starting a much needed conversation. This is not an attack on anyone per say. More of a conversation starter. First of all: I believe in a women’s right to choose.
Thread: I’m conflicted: @jordanbpeterson says a lot of great things. I believe in most of his message when I listen to him. He was speaking to @DonaldJTrumpJr and two other people backstage for @BreitbartNews the other day and I caught the clip.

There was a speech given by the First Lady. It was an amazing speech and it seemed to be written for another time.		It was. @MichelleObama had the very same speech years before, word for word. 		I guess if you are going to #BeBest you should steal from the very best. 		Miss you. https://t.co/8tifXIhqOK
I have a wall 🏰 in my yard. 		It’s called a fence 🚧		It has a major venerability. 		It’s called a door 🚪 		Also the neighbor has a ladder		It’s also only 7 foot tall		Any plane ✈️ , drone 🛸 or bird 🐦 can penetrate my wall 🏰		But most people just walk in 🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏻‍♂️		Because visas
For the $5.7 billion for a wall that won’t keep but 2 people out: dumb and dumber people, every child in America could have access to Free healthcare at COST. 		Healthcare is an investment in society that yields returns.		Walls are a waste.		#NoBanNoWall
@rhonda_harbison Oh no: there are low information voters who watch Faux Entertainment all over the country.
Homeland Security just sent me this. Can someone get it to @parscale and @realDonaldTrump ? I believe we have figured it out boys and girls. https://t.co/R7My5hfr1e

Two thoughts:		1. Trump is wayyy too happy the government is shut down. Why?		2. Wasn’t Pence, the same guy who lied to us about #Iraq, also the head of the trump transition team? 		#ImpeachmentTime

This is so cool I had to share. This Brazilian Family bought a pig to kill for Holiday dinner. Instead they changed their mind and adopted her! (Yes you will translate it) https://t.co/rF5HYRsSZW
Forests are the most powerful and efficient carbon-capture system on the planet. The Bonn Challenge, issued by world leaders with the goal of reforestation and restoration of 150 million hectares of degraded landscapes by 2020, has been adopted by 56 countries. We have two years!

@StopLyingPrez @GOP They are very complicit. I all things. Someone at the RNC in 2001 have a bunch of emails backed from the server the White House used to circumvent the archives. I want those emails.
@clairecmc The reason why you don't get @AOC is the same reason why you are gone. While the world burned, you voted to increase to fuel the flame. Do some heavy thinking before you step on the campaign trail again. We are watching. #Resistance #Resist
Senator Mike knows. #ResistanceRises https://t.co/bugLhgvD7k
DIck Cheney and the GOP were told by Israel and other states that they should not go through with invading Iraq and yet they did it anyway. What does this say about Dick Cheney and the @GOP ?
People: The president said that it is OK to not give federal workers raises because they are "mostly democrats". Is this illegal?
Record-shattering heat wave scorches Australia as temperatures reach 120 degrees. I have lived through 121 heat wave in Arizona. Not fun. I mean after 100 its starts to be unbearable and I stopped carrying CD music in my car because it would melt. #GlobalWarming
Did you know that that Alaska, Hawaii, Maine and Vermont have banned billboard advertising? Vermont in 1968, Hawaii in 1927, Maine's in 1977, and Alaska's in 1959. #TIL
Philippine's Department of Environment stops "130,000 Balloon Drop" Guinness Record Attempt due to the public's concern over the garbage it will generate. We will always remember @ClevelandOhio_
@rosebudblues10 @xDrGirlfriendx I’m sorry you are going through that. No one should ever have to go through so much pain.
@Catheri66837679 @sillymickel #IBelieve #WeGotThis
@rosebudblues10 @xDrGirlfriendx With insurance?!?! What????
Crickets coming from the @GOP and @WhiteHouse. What do #Republicans believe in? We as a society need to figure that out. https://t.co/AGSMtEUYPG
@rosebudblues10 @xDrGirlfriendx Scary. Imagine what life would be like without calling for overpriced taxis? 😂 #SorryNotSorry #UbersNotAmbulances
@wysiwyg503 Exactly! #Wegotthis
@TeresaCulhane I was here. I can’t comment at this time. Thank you.
. @realDonaldTrump issues executive order freezing federal workers' pay in 2019. His framing of the issue is it’s democrats fault and they only want democrats getting paid. What do the GOP believe? Nothing.
@rosebudblues10 @xDrGirlfriendx Washington State. Many other states as well.
@martinleecobb @wire_zombie I do. This is the world we were born for. Keep fighting! #Resist
I bet on me as well. #BetOnYou https://t.co/kp71Yi3Fjp
Did anyone else notice that the 911 system for a whole state was hacked and shut down in Washington? Also in other states in recent months. Someone is pissed. #American #Russian #Iraqi #Syrian #Mexican #Canadian ?
I #Followback if you follow me. Thanks!
I learned a ton of things while watching one of the greatest actors EVER Christian Bale in the movie Vice. I won’t spoil it for you but you can find me on @Spotify talking about Dick Cheney’s wars. Check it out and let me know what you think. I’m mad all over again. #Resist
