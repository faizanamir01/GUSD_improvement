May we also remember that her action to not get up from that seat on the bus was considered radical and unpopular by many. Those of us who demand justice know that it was a needed action. May we continue on the path for justice no matter how unpopular it may be.
#RosaParks holds a special place in the hearts of the residents in Detroit and the 13th. What an honor was it for her to call Detroit home. She also worked in the congressional office for the Honorable John Conyers. An amazing woman in the work toward freedom.
Rosa Parks was born on this day in 1913. We remember her for her courageous action on that Montgomery Bus in December of 1955, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and for all of her work in the Civil Rights Movement and beyond. #RosaParks is a true embodiment of the fight for justice. https://t.co/6dSW1vuRwJ
I ask us all to celebrate this month with action to fight against the continued bigotry by helping to dismantle the racialized policies and structures that keep us from truly being free.
Today marks the beginning of Black History Month. The 13th Congressional District has led historic fights for freedom, justice &amp; equality. We still have more work to do. We have yet to create the America that truly protects, honors and respects our Black neighbors. https://t.co/QvGrPKBwt7

Greedy pharmaceutical companies are not helping our healthcare system. No one should be harmed or lose their life because they cannot afford life-saving drugs.

The #TrumpShutdown shouldn’t have happened in the first place. This was unnecessary and I’m glad that the harm that so many Americans faced is ending. We have a job in the coming days to not allow this President to push a fake crisis and we cannot buy into his dangerous rhetoric.
It’s extremely important to me to stay connected to residents in the 13th Congressional District, even when I’m in D.C. I will be calling constituents every week to hear from them. #13thDistrictStrong
We must #EndTheShutdown now. I cannot stress enough how this is causing a crisis for some of our most vulnerable residents, in addition to the federal workers who are furloughed and working without pay.
Yesterday, I called a constituent that is concerned about the ongoing, unnecessary #TrumpShutdown. He's a resident of Wayne, MI, who became disabled because of a car accident during his childhood. He is fearful about what will happen to his HUD assistance for housing. https://t.co/Z6WL7HreMl

Hands off our bodies. #FightForRoe
It is also time to repeal the Hyde Amendment which disproportionally impacts low-income folks and people of color, preventing these communities from getting the access to abortion care that we all have a right to. #Roe46
Today is the anniversary for Roe v. Wade, which made abortions legal. Since then, we have seen countless attacks on reproductive rights &amp; body autonomy for those who can become pregnant. We must continue to #FightForRoe &amp; ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need.
I stand with the trans community, and the LGBTQ community as as whole, in ending discriminatory policies and practices. It is our duty to work toward acceptance, no matter who you are.
The #TransMilitaryBan is another example of how this administration continues to discriminate against marginalized communities and push forth a culture of bigotry. It is sad to see the SCOTUS allow this ban to go into effect.
Let’s commit ourselves to service, justice, and a swift timetable toward freedom and justice. #MLK90 #MLK https://t.co/hhB4UwTHnU
We must center the oppressed in our fight for justice and not set our own timetable for another person’s freedom. That timetable for freedom and justice is now and we must set out on the path towards it. #MLK90 #MLK
Dr. King urged allies to not wait to act, to not choose so called 'order' when there is an urgent need for justice. We must not shun direct actions just because we are uncomfortable with the methods. #MLK90 #MLK

@HouseDemocrats This comes after we passed legislation last week that guarantees federal workers back pay.
@HouseDemocrats The Financial Relief for Federal Employees Act directs the Federal Government to issue loans to federal workers with zero interest and zero fees if a shutdown exceeds 15 consecutive days.

The reality is that federal workers have bills that need to be paid. The reality is that millions of Americans cannot afford for the #TrumpShutdown to go another day. Trump and McConnell need to realize this. End the shutdown now.
Day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown. Day 24 of 800k federal workers not being paid for their work. Day 24 of workers being forced to stay home and not get a paycheck. Day 24 of government services for vulnerable populations being in jeopardy. All over a made up crisis. #EndTheShutdown

And we heard from Jessie, with LA VIDA @CHASSCenter. They provide essential services to women who’ve faced domestic abuse and sexual violence. They depend on #VAWA for funding. The #TrumpShutdown has led #VAWA to be expired and now LA VIDA hangs in limbo.

As this #TrumpShutdown continues, we are still waiting on the United States Senate to take action and for the President to signal a willingness to end this harm for federal workers and those who depend on government programs.
Then we heard from Jack, who is a local attorney. He represents a client that has had their discrimination claim case delayed twice because of a threat of a shutdown and now this #TrumpShutdown. He talked about how EEOC, veteran claims, and social security cases will be delayed.
