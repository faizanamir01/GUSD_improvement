With all the lies, fraud, and deception, it begs the question, what are the Democrats doing with this hearing? Cohen will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. His presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people will see through this.
This man plead guilty to cheating on his taxes and lying to the IRS. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. He lied about delivering his own child, and his wife had to correct the record.
If the Democrats were after the truth today, they would have had an honest person here testifying. And they would not have limited the questioning to just their chosen few topics.
How is Michael Cohen credible to testify on financial transactions when he lied on financial documents?
The Democrats are asking someone who lied to Congress and broke campaign finance laws to be the star witness to our hearing at Oversight &amp; Reform. Is this the best witness they have?

Do you remember this? During the third presidential debate, Trump denounced partial-birth abortion, explaining the process in stomach-churning detail. In her response, Hillary Clinton gave a ‘robotic, ghoulish response defending the practice.’
There is also an argument to be made, as many have, that Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump due to her extreme position on abortion.
The United States is only 1 in 7 countries worldwide that even allow abortions in the late term – 20 weeks or later. Joining us at the bottom of the 198 countries worldwide are notorious human rights offenders like China and North Korea.

If a doctor had a prescription that would save lives – like, a cure for cancer – it'd be malpractice not to administer it to patients. Now @realDonaldTrump has the prescription that would end the humanitarian crisis at our border, and Dems are refusing to help him administer it.
Unlike when Obama dramatized the shutdown and used theatrics to exaggerate its effects, Trump admin and @RussVought45 are minimizing the impact on our country and hardworking Americans. Kudos to Russ and the president for their handling of this shutdown. https://t.co/E6ySMNX26X

Congratulations Speaker @GlenCasada on your election today. I know you will serve every Tennessean well leading the people’s House!
Congratulations @ltgovmcnally on your re-election as Lt. Governor and Speaker of the Senate! It was an honor to serve with you, and TN will benefit from your continued leadership.
Schumer and Pelosi seem callous to the human suffering due to our unsecure border. The compassionate and just action is to secure our border, and we need a wall or physical barrier to do that. #SecureOurBorder
The president has shown he’s willing to negotiate. Instead of a concrete wall, he’s offered a cheaper, metal wall that would be just as effective. But it seems Democrats don’t want a deal; they don’t want border security. They want to resist. #SecureOurBorder #TrumpAddress
60k illegal and inadmissible aliens arrive at our southern border every month. Immigration courts can’t handle all of them – the backlog is nearly 800k cases. We need to send a message with and finish the wall on our southern border. #SecureOurBorder
90% of heroin in this country comes across our southern border. Heroin, in turn, kills 300 Americans each week. We need to get tough, build the wall and save lives. #TrumpAddress
What about Israel’s right to exist? As Israel’s strongest ally and the world’s lone superpower, the U.S. has a duty to protect it from those who want to destroy it. https://t.co/Q6yGBvSgQR
We shouldn’t be punishing success – we should encourage it. Exorbitant taxation on America’s most successful sends the wrong message. https://t.co/A7W0jS8PHv
Even the @washingtonpost admitted this weekend there is a crisis at our southern border. As Republicans have tried to explain, the president is not making this up. Democrat colleagues, it’s time to give it up and act ASAP. https://t.co/U6TL4fVmhq

They should put mindless, anti-Trump antics aside, change course and heed the president's request for additional wall funding for the country's sake.
I am disappointed the new Pelosi-controlled Congress doesn't seem to take our open border crisis seriously. It's proven around the world walls work -- experts say it will decrease the illegal flow of dangerous people and substances across our southern border.
What an honor. #116thCongress https://t.co/wDL3x9YWpt
