Actual national emergencies that need our attention NOW:	🔹22 veteran suicides a day	🔹Climate change 	🔹130 deaths from the opioid epidemic every day	🔹Lack of clean drinking water in underserved communities
This American people have made clear that they want us focused on lowering the cost of healthcare, growing middle class wages, and fighting the influence of special interests in Washington. I remain focused on delivering on these priorities for #CA21.
I’ve repeatedly laid out my support for more judges to clear the backlog of immigration cases, more funding to give our law enforcement the tools they need to keep our border secure, and ensuring we lock down our ports of entry, where the majority of drugs come into the US.
But the President overstepped his constitutional authority to declare he will divert scarce taxpayer dollars to a project we all know is unnecessary and ineffective.
President Trump’s emergency declaration to sidestep the Constitution is short-sighted, irresponsible, and lawless. Our Founding Fathers constructed a system of checks and balances to protect the people from executive overreach.

My bill, the Immediate Financial Relief for Federal Employees Act, will actually provide those suffering from the shutdown 0% interest loans from the Treasury. But many are turning to predatory lenders with triple digit interest rates (that the Administration refuses to regulate) https://t.co/aiBgY9Qw4C
Proud to have the support of the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys for my bill, the Immediate Financial Relief for Federal Employees Act. It's not enough to get paid after the shutdown: federal employees across the country need money to pay their bills now.

She’s right - it’s actually 800k people, making impossible financial decisions every day as they are forced to work without compensation.

Let's be clear: this shutdown was never about about border security. And the pain of this shutdown is being felt by middle-class men and women across this country. Let's keep the focus on them - you can read the full text of my bill here:	https://t.co/VLgxSKfRfS 5/5
These loans would have no fees and accrue no interest. It is our responsibility as legislators to find innovative solutions and sponsor legislation that give federal employees access to financial resources and loans during unnecessary and partisan shutdowns 4/

On border security, I know more unites us than divides us. We need more funding for our border agents &amp; 21st century surveillance. But experts agree: the wall won’t make us safer, and a shutdown is no way to get there. Read my op-Ed in today’s @FresnoBee:	https://t.co/vQox9eXjKD
If this shutdown was actually about border security, we wouldn't be forcing thousands of border agents and other law enforcement officers to work without pay

The cost of the trade war is not being borne by President Trump and his donors - it's being paid by hardworking farm workers in places like the Central Valley. We should be looking to expand markets for our farmers, not running them into the ground.
The furor around the border wall shouldn't distract form this reality: we need comprehensive immigration reform, with a path to citizenship, now.
