I was elected to give #ia01 a seat at the table. After my visit to Precision Metalworks in Maquoketa, I spoke about the impressive work they do with other rural entrepreneurs during @HouseSmallBiz hearing. It’s critical @sbagov hears what works to spur innovation in our state! https://t.co/IZYBskEQSb
Farmers in #ia01 still hurting from POTUS Twitter trade war. 		IA families literally can’t afford the pain. 		I’ll keep working every day to make sure the administration &amp; folks across DC hear the reality of their decisions 		We can’t be ignored any longer	https://t.co/qkFNVoIwpr

My view in @TransportDems while we dive into how infrastructure policy can help mitigate &amp; adapt to climate change. Important concrete (see what I did there? :) ) work ahead in #ia01! https://t.co/1p32AvQ8Ev
Tune in for our conversation on the need for more resilient infrastructure with @TransportDem’s: https://t.co/azzPjVje6G
I hear it across #ia01 &amp; now the there’s a poll to prove it! Iowans want to stay in Iowa. That’s why I’m working for investments in infrastructure, housing &amp; trade schools to keep hardworking Iowans here &amp; create opportunity for friends, kids &amp; grandkids to come back home. 👷‍♀️ https://t.co/9Oj050H2uv
Great to spend time w/ @CSPANCities as they showcased @CityofCRiowa! Always proud to share the communities that make #IA01 special. https://t.co/BSCkiBb5SU

Enjoyed having coffee w/veterans at the Veterans Freedom Center to listen &amp; talk about how we can ensure all veterans get the support they deserve. Our office is happy to help w/casework, from benefit issues to making sure our heroes receive their medals. Call us at 319-364-2288 https://t.co/wzxaMJmjQx
One of my favorite parts of the job - meeting with Iowans of all ages! https://t.co/Tyli6TAOHw
(2/2) I urge my Senate colleagues to put country and Iowa over party and call out this Administration's reckless games. This chaos and dysfunction are now risking funds that #IA01 is counting on for the CR flood wall. I'll fight every day to not let that happen.
(1/2)We need to keep our borders secure &amp; our government running. That’s why Congress came together &amp; passed a bipartisan spending bill. Declaring a national emergency, defying our constitution, taking billions of unauthorized taxpayer dollars ignores important checks &amp; balances.
My statement on reports that President Trump will declare a national emergency:	https://t.co/IoMmmO4SCy
It’s been 1 year since #Parkland. We must always work to do better &amp; honor the lives we lost. I’m happy to see #hr8 pass out of committee &amp; continue to move forward.

Proud to join roll out of the #FAMILYAct. Iowans deserve more than talking points, they deserve legislation that reflects the values we grew up with. It’s time EVERY parent, including adoptive, can spend time w/ their child &amp; families can care for each other w/o economic anxiety. https://t.co/Q0nFA087Lc
Great to meet w/ representatives from @SpecialOlympics Iowa.

Honored to share the #SOTU w/Jesse. He lives in West Union &amp; called me during the shutdown bc his FSA coworkers were struggling. This is not the way we treat the ppl helping our farmers. I listened &amp; promised to do everything I could to stop it from happening again. https://t.co/MqdsSej7iw

In Iowa, women are paid 77 cents for every dollar men earn. That’s a gap of $11,034/year. On the 10th anniversary of the #LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act, we celebrate the pioneering women who have fought for equal pay &amp; roll up our sleeves to continue their work. https://t.co/v0wWc5SfgW

1.1 million Iowans are counting on a functioning government to get their tax refunds back. That’s why I’m proud to have voted to re-open IRS &amp; key agencies, putting money back in the pockets of Iowans—and again urge the Senate to do the same.
I came to Washington to put government back to work for everyday Iowans. That means having a government that’s up &amp; running while both parties negotiate.
Great visiting with Randy &amp; Andrew from UNI! Our universities don’t just provide opportunities for our students—research at our schools strengthens Iowa’s economy. Go Panthers! https://t.co/PwMEMZQIfs
Honored to share my swearing-in with the people of #IA01 &amp; my parents, who taught me the values I’ll fight for here in Congress. Schools, health care, infrastructure and so much more are on the line. Ready to get to work! https://t.co/C5YvExK0lI
