Pharmaceutical companies make billions in profits while working Americans use kickstarters to pay for health care.		So proud to join my sister @RepJayapal in introducing the #MedicareforAll Act today!
In 2019, no one should have their right to vote denied. Let’s restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. Let’s pass HR4. #RestoreTheVote
As one voter suppression expert wrote, “It is just so Jim Crow… What we have today, with poll closures done in the interest of ‘streamlining’ and ‘saving taxpayer money,’ is no less pernicious. And no less pervasive.” https://t.co/aoRADx7m6s
In 2018 alone, 10 counties with large black populations in Georgia closed polling spots after a white elections consultant recommended they do so to save money
In Georgia, where Brian Kemp oversaw the largest voter purge in history, poll closures correlate almost perfectly with high poverty areas across the state—where people are more likely to vote Democratic https://t.co/JhYhXGsjD7
In North Carolina’s majority-black Mecklenburg County, poll closures reduced black turnout by over 50 percent(!) in 2016 https://t.co/rQKRVkfWEb
Indiana has shuttered more than 1/5 of all polling locations https://t.co/hJiCaFBUP1
Arizona, has closed 200 voting sites, more per capita than even Texas https://t.co/vLcwUxNY52
Texas, where the growing Latino population threatens Republican dominance, closed over 400 polling places since 2013 https://t.co/aOyKzOZfTZ
Here are some of the worst examples:
And now we know why: Within five years of that decision, nearly 1,000 polling places in the U.S. have been closed—many of them in primarily black counties https://t.co/9lzDrYTL3f
It was a direct rebuke of the Civil Rights Movement and Dr. Martin Luther King
In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act– making it more difficult for black and minority voters to vote

This is the biggest challenge of our time. Let’s seize the moment. Let’s put the policies behind the Green New Deal into law! 💪🏽
We cannot let the urgency of this die. We can’t just settle for a select committee or resolution. We rallied for a big bold solution and momentum for our policies is at an all-time high.

We are here to legislate to our reality. And the reality is we’re in the majority.

And I will keep fighting until we’ve fully repealed the Muslim ban and put this hateful policy into the dustbin of history where it belongs.
That’s why one of the first billed I cosponsored was the Freedom of Religion Act—to explicitly ban religious discrimination in our immigration system.
Trump may not have gotten his border wall, but he’s created an invisible wall keeping out people out based solely on their religion.
From 2016-2018, the government cut admissions for Muslim refugees by 91 percent. Visa approvals from the 8 Muslim-majority countries included in the ban have plummeted 70% since 2016. https://t.co/HDJn0oMFtN
Trump has succeeded in tearing apart thousands of families and destroying lives around the world—even in the face of court challenges.
As someone who came here as refugee from one of the banned countries, this is personal to me.
Today marks 2 years since Trump signed the first Muslim ban—a moment that will go down as a moral stain on this country’s history.
