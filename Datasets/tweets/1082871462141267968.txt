@young_maymay @laurenduca Harris's "appeal to the left", with some other promises in a platform (maybe not m4a) and (hopefully) an actually progressive cabinet (unlikely).

@young_maymay @laurenduca honestly this seems decently likely.. after a close election with harris and booker splitting most of the black vote, and elizabeth warren winning in some parts of the midwest, Northeast, and losing cali to harris (at which point Bernie's dropped out), one could see this as 1/2
