Por ejemplo, detailed CIA report on USSR housing policy- https://t.co/Pocl4ovtPB - ideology only tells part of the picture of what happens in a state, and talking about states only in ideological terms makes it easy to weaponize ideology to demonize good policy.

Isn't this the authoritarian-lite right and center-right since at least the New Deal? Capitulate to me and give me cover for hurting people, or we'll break the government and hurt people? I mean, this was the Tea Party foundational philosophy, for one. https://t.co/1Qjjc0KAom

Note too that the people who are most invested in discrediting the Russia investigation are coincidentally the least likely to be harmed by the implementation of the worldview of people like Peter Theil, Robert Mercer, Erik Prince, and Steve Bannon.
Long story short - leftist “anti-imperialists” have decided that it’s more important to defend Putin and Trump and will get people killed as well as legitimize the transnational racist authoritarian nightmare that Putin and the mafia Russian state are trying to build in the west.
The US doesn’t go to war with nations that have nuclear weapons because those nations are harder to bully. Hence why we plan to attack Venezuela and Iran but dialogue with Russia and North Korea.
It’s an assertion with literally no proof. DC think tankers and defense hawks occasionally flirt with the idea, but there’s a reason that most think tank proposals are not taken seriously by actual policy makers. It also distracts from this admin’s actual rush to attack Iran.
The idea that the Mueller investigation is a setup for war with Russia is the worst, most cynical view here-ahistorical propaganda meant to sow doubt, promoted both by journalists with potential legal exposure in the Russia investigations as well as Russia-sympathetic media.
It’s important to call out the government for abuses and anti-democratic actions around the world. But the FBI, the IC, and the Mueller team/SDNY etc. are actually doing the right thing and investigating the right shit here.
Yes, the US has interfered in elections. It still is today. That doesn’t mean that Russia and US GOP should be given a free pass for destroying what semblance of free elections exists in the US. Or do you only care about voter suppression when you can fundraise off of it?
It’s frightening that instead of recognizing the necessity of a temporary alliance with the center and center-right on the Mueller investigation and white collar crime that led to this, many US leftists would rather defend Putin using Trump’s arguments. It’s sickening.
I mean, the Russian state and the Russian mafia are fully intertwined at this point, and extreme right wingers/authoritarians/neofascists are being united into a globalized movement under Putin’s leadership in collaboration with US and European right wing leaders.
There is a long history of left-wing opposition to organized crime, especially amongst Socialists/Communists. Yes, there are people who fetishize military and law enforcement who also support the Russia investigation. That doesn’t make the investigation wrong.
No limits to the violent cruelty of this administration. They want more people to die. I’m sure that the Trump/GOP connections to organized crime have nothing to do with this at all. https://t.co/dIWWwfFjtq

TELL THEM NANCY! Though the press still won't listen to the plain, uncomplicated truth of your words. https://t.co/uP5atZIgp5
@owillis I saw that live and took it as making fun of him/sarcasm, fwiw.
@MEPFuller Isn't being for it, then against, then for it again pretty much what brought us to this point? They're pretty much in alignment with the Trump Doctrine now.
@JRubinBlogger They're like family members. He looks adorable. I'm so sorry.
@RepCummings My spouse = fed employee whose work involves immigration. While we're struggling, please continue to resist this hostage taking by this administration. Giving in = more GOP shutdowns when they want to ram through unpopular policies = more uncertainty for fed workers. thank you!
@ChrisVanHollen My spouse = fed employee whose work involves immigration. While we're struggling, please continue to resist this hostage taking by this administration. Giving in = more GOP shutdowns when they want to ram through unpopular policies = more uncertainty for fed workers. thank you!
@RepEscobar My spouse = fed employee whose work involves immigration. While we're struggling, please continue to resist this hostage taking by this administration. Giving in = more GOP shutdowns when they want to ram through unpopular policies = more uncertainty for fed workers. thank you!
It's terrifying that this happened on US soil with zero accountability. What's not surprising is that the "OMG losing our sovereignty" nationalist types have no problem letting autocrats run roughshod over our laws, as long as it's the autocrats they like. https://t.co/YKma4QIo60
Same story - word for word - as me. They only get worse. https://t.co/Df3jkIYTUN
@jbview It kneecaps daca/tps and hollows out asylum protections. The whole thing is a poison pill.
By claiming that this is the only bill that can be considered in the Senate, McConnell owns this bill, and is now a de facto Stephen Miller collaborator. https://t.co/8A4ds1hKVn
32 days of a shutdown and not one reporter (demanding that Dems give DJT his wall in return for opening the govt plus a D priority) can explain how this would create less uncertainty for fed workers instead of more. If Ds give in, what removes R incentive to do it again?
Co-signing - I cant agree enough with this sentiment. https://t.co/FXVCdJc3bp
The media will continue to treat him as credible, though, and responsibly blame both sides when one is so clearly full of shit. https://t.co/JAWyjhkMyS
Agreed. This is just fantastic. https://t.co/QdrLoABlDC
Shocker, McConnell lied. Also, today is Tuesday. https://t.co/HUbzhHRBiz
@StevenTDennis All the “why won’t Dems negotiate?” takes completely ignore this reality, and also ignore that the same dynamic applies no matter how long the shutdown goes on. Why is “no negotiations when the government is closed” the unreasonable position in your analysis?
@StevenTDennis If Schumer made a wall deal, what would stop GOP from prolonging the shutdown or causing another shutdown in the future to secure other unpopular policies like say a wholesale destruction of asylum protections? What is the limiting principle if Dems give in to hostage taking?
Thread, but BLUF is that this bill destroys asylum law in the US. https://t.co/xiaoHQd9Uq
@AmandaMarcotte Also gutting the asylum system, especially for unaccompanied minors, doesn’t lend itself to a bipartisan deal. They literally snuck in systemic destruction of asylum under the guise of a daca deal. Also they lied about the TPS extension.
Can’t emphasize this enough. Especially as someone affected by the shutdown. https://t.co/ahLjzjWhj4
Reiterating a point I made earlier. Completely agree. https://t.co/O80AOLNyn6
So glad that the new members of Congress aren’t letting themselves get played by sanctimonious concern trolling by conservative media. This is a wonderful change from years past. https://t.co/RBxjqBZ5Ag
This is instructive re: the Academy nomination process but I’m still salty about STBY not getting nearly the recognition that it deserves. https://t.co/EILMhQonsi
Remember that joke about Glenn Beck’s activities in 1990? The media still hasn’t paid attention to the lesson of that joke, and they are still making the same mistakes. https://t.co/u8VAv5JP0i
Agreed. https://t.co/cimqQJxM12
@TheToddSchulte @TomJawetz Got ahead of myself. 1293 is the page number - end of Section 106. Still subsection (F).
1293 is the page number - end of section 106
Currently asylum applications are confidential by regulation. This provision changes that bigly by allowing the government to disclose asylum applications and docs submitted - bc this administration wants to break the asylum system by any means necessary. https://t.co/1GaTrOb3Fs
I hope @DLind (and others reporting on this) noticed this because the disclosure requirements for asylum applications will put people at risk in a way that has been unappreciated in the commentary on the “compromise” between Miller and Kushner... https://t.co/vPqJT7WvWF
@TheToddSchulte @TomJawetz There is stuff in this bill that is creating new dangers for asylum applicants. 1293(F) is going to put people in danger through disclosure requirements. Media hasn’t caught this yet.
I usually fall off of the rail entirely. 😹😹😹😹 https://t.co/smowONntZF
Totally agree - anyone who paid attention to the previous poison pills in the failed "DACA for wall" proposals before now knew where this was going. Miller strikes again, but this whole admin thinks they are the smartest, most clever people ever. https://t.co/nABbnjAyTk
It's amazing to see history being made in real time. https://t.co/fPrz6vMLb3
Well, this is a disturbing development - explains why the right-wing gaslighting about this incident went into overdrive and even fooled some centrist media personalities. https://t.co/PuOZ0XPyko
PC for thee, but not for me has always been a conservative mantra. The snowflake and fuck your feelings shit was projection. They’re sensitive and sheltered. https://t.co/sPPOCCZofr
This is odd considering that e-verify is shut down as part of the shitdown, but it is very funny. https://t.co/Jv1WYsaNNQ
It is cold in Baltimore and the shitdown continues. I wish I could fly away to Hawaii or something.
