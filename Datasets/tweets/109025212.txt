Never before in history of organized government can anyone recall so much stupidity accomplished by so few in so short amount of time. Editorials across the country lead us to believe we are becoming a banana republic. My fellow Americans, pray for our beloved country.
Why is the Senate behaving in such a sneaky and secretive way to deny access to the members of the their needs and wishes? Denial of the rights of the elected representatives of the people is morally and constitutionally wrong.
There were no limits or constrictions on this rule. It was the view of myself and other chairmen that this was a constitutional right which could not be interfered with.
In more than 16 years as chairman of a major investigative committee of the House and a number of years as chairman of investigative subcommittees, the rule of the House was that any member is entitled to have full access to any paper or information in the committee’s possession.

The decision by @SpeakerRyan to oust Father Conroy is a great disservice to the body and to our nation. It is my hope that he will soon provide answers as to why this decision was made. Based on early press reports, I share the concerns of many.
The House Chaplain is an important position for the institution, no matter their denomination. His or her words open the House every day, and if more membets sat and listened to their counsel this country would be better off.
On the rare occasions that I visit Capitol Hill, one if the first people I go see is Father Conroy. He was a source of advice and counsel that I relied on during my time in Congress, and he’s one of the more honorable and dignified individuals found in that building these days.

@rockrichard It’s a damn crime, really.
Today, Republicans prefer to call it “trickle-down economics” because what they’re actully doing is pissing on your leg and telling you it’s raining.		The truth is this #GOPTaxScam is nothing but a huge tax cut for the rich at the expense of everyone else.

Well, that's that. Goodnight.
Actual reforms can be made to improve the Affordable Care Act. This rushed, reckless repeal bill is not that. Too many people will be hurt.
Hell, I don't even remember why I started telling this story, except to urge folks to call their Congressperson and demand more from them.
They spent nearly a decade doing everything they could to undermine the ACA, and now throw their hands up in the air and declare it broken.
They haven't thought about the 24 million estimated to lose their coverage, or the millions more who have benefited from Medicaid expansion.
This week, House Republicans are planning to vote to undo all that progress, taking us backward in the fight for universal, affordable care.
7 years ago this week, I sat with @POTUS44 &amp; others as decades of our collective hard work became law. Or as @JoeBiden called it: a big deal https://t.co/PbO1R4L4oF
Millions now have coverage they never had before. Lifesaving screenings. Preventive care. Affordable rates &amp; subsidies that SCALE with cost.
Was Obamacare perfect? Hell no. The only perfect law was handed to Moses on stone tablets by God himself. Obamacare was an important start.
[My friend Jon Stewart would go on to use that same gavel to enjoy a snack on @TheDailyShow program later that year] https://t.co/h1oJqs3AlK
When the ACA was up in the House, leadership asked me to preside over part of the debate. I accepted with one term: I'm bringing my gavel. https://t.co/8fIPusoEIV
Before this, many had to decide between bankruptcy or death. Children hit lifetime caps. Cancer &amp; being a woman were preexisting conditions.
So we fought to expand coverage. We worked to lower costs. We wanted the American people to finally KNOW what their plan actually included.
Our bill aimed to bring certainty to an uncertain experience. You don't hope to have to use insurance. But if you do, it needs be damn good.
Hearing after hearing, amendment after amendment. We took the time to hear concerns from all.		Republicans were invited, too. They declined.
Nevertheless, we persisted. It was an honor to work with so many great champions of our nation in helping to craft the Affordable Care Act.
We took another shot in the 90s but again came up short. You know who knew damn well how complicated health care could be?		@HillaryClinton.
Over the years we'd create the National Institutes of Health, the Children's Health Insurance Program, &amp; many other efforts to improve care.
It was an accomplishment but was not my end goal. I continued to reintroduce my father's bill every year. As pieces of it slowly became law.
It's tough to see in the photo, but I had McCormack &amp; others sign the gavel. They made me sign too. All told, my pop would have been proud.
It took years to work through, but then-Speaker McCormack brought our bill to the floor in 65 and gave me the honor of gaveling its passage. https://t.co/Zg1R2I86xu
I was a pup at the time, but I began working with my colleagues on Medicare legislation. Cecil King. Aime Forand. My dear friend John Moss. https://t.co/Q033Fw2XGV
In 1957--and every Congress thereafter--I'd reintroduce my father's bill &amp; work to create a national program to take care of those in need.
He never would get to see universal health care become law. He passed in 55 and I decided to run to replace him, vowing to keep up his work.
But his effort wasn't as successful in '43. The Wagner-Murray-Dingell bill to create a national health program ultimately died in committee.
He spent the decade prior fighting like hell to pass Social Security &amp; see it signed into law. And he did. Big nose &amp; mustache in the back. https://t.co/NechCqycRI
In 1943, my father was one of the first people to introduce comprehensive health care reform in Congress, a single-payer system for all.

Trump's taxes are important, but I'm waiting on the long-form.
Most interesting # in Trump's taxes: 24,000,000.		Oh no wait that's just how many Americans will lose health care under his terrible plan.
Listened to 5 mins of @PressSec's briefing.		GOP repeal sounds more and more like a "three-pronged" plan to screw over the American people.
Trumpcare should now die on the vine as the terrible legislation it is.

I look forward to living up to Adams's wish, FDR's belief, &amp; the promise we make to our children to leave this place better than we found it
But also vote against the most crude &amp; reckless candidate I've ever seen. A man who does not belong to the Republican party I knew or know.
We have a unique opportunity to not only elect one of the wisest &amp; most qualified individuals to ever run for the highest office in America,
He wrote of Men because most did not yet recognize that women would one day make their voices heard and prove they could do or be anything.
FDR ordered this inscribed into the fireplace where our President gathers with world leaders and foreign dignitaries.
...May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof."
He wrote: "I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House &amp; all that shall hereafter inhabit it....
1800. Sorry.
In it, he updated her on his travels and some personal affairs, but he closed with a blessing that always struck me--and FDR--as meaningful.
The blessing was actually written by John Adams, an excerpt of a letter he wrote to his wife Abigail in 1900.
In 1945, Franklin Roosevelt ordered a blessing carved into the stone fireplace of the White House State Dining Room, where it remains.

Game actually ended in a 1-1 tie. Mueller had to have thrown at least 400 pitches. He was a nice guy, but I'd be madder than a boiled owl.
It was hotter than Chinese mustard out there, too. O'Neill came walking out to pull him and motioned for Dizzy Trout from the bullpen.
Hell, I once saw Les Mueller leave the Tigers, fight in WWII, and return in '45 to throw 19 &amp; 2/3 innings in one game. Barely broke a sweat.
Turns out the key to a no-hitter is throwing as few pitches as possible so your manager doesn't just come in and screw the whole thing up.

RT @umichfootball: Happy Birthday, Jim. #GoBlue http://t.co/kameWJ7F5S
No matter how charming the hospital staff may find me, I'm beginning to think they share my hope that I leave here sooner rather than later.

Today, I'm happy to announce the release of my annual holiday #DingellJingle via @BuzzFeeders: http://t.co/0yvvHKVeo8 http://t.co/WruBnbSdUX
Looking forward to releasing my updated holiday jingle in the morning. In the meantime, here's 2013's: http://t.co/9xvo7FKbjb #DingellJingle
Sad to hear of the passing of Clifford creator Norman Bridwell. One of my favorites to read to local school children. http://t.co/m8mkv3rOwe
Feeling well &amp; on the mend. Stuck in hospital, but looking forward to being back home as soon as I can. Thankful for prayers &amp; well wishes.
And no, you're not done with me just yet, Twitter.
Honored to cast my final vote on behalf of the proud people of Michigan.		To this day, I consider myself the luckiest guy in shoe leather.
Well, this is quite a suspenseful lead up to my final votes as a member of Congress.
Oops. Fixed that. RT @daveweigel: John Dingell is the first Dem “aye” on Cromnibus rule.

You know, now that I think of it, I've not yet coached a college football team...
No matter the coach. No matter the challenge. Win or lose. Thick and thin. One thing has always remained true: It's about The Team. #GoBlue

With the holidays approaching, I can now focus on an important tradition: my annual holiday jingle.		Here's 2013's: http://t.co/iiQtVnNzjz
I did it myself and saved you a click, @darth! http://t.co/FW9uUdOPVk
Ha! RT @cdingell: @john_dingell found it. http://t.co/ISXnoB1Pp1

FINISH STRONG. #HAIL #GoBlue
RT @umichbball: 47-41 Wolverines (7:57 left), and this @barclayscenter crowd is looking awfully Maize and Blue. #HAIL
@sotomorrow Ha! Him too. cc: @SenCarlLevin
In many ways, it's almost like watching Cazzie Russell play again. Keep it up and stay focused, @CarisLeVert. #GoBlue
You know, it's just simply FUN to watch @CarisLeVert play ball. Just a true athlete in every way.		Let's go, 〽️.

The president was right: Congress must act. We need a longterm plan that addresses the real challenges we face, not political ploys. Action.

RT @umichbball: It's game day in Ann Arbor.		They're ready. Are you? http://t.co/CQXmSz1b4F
@ColbyItkowitz Ha! I figured mine were lame enough already.
My fowl puns aside, this legislation is something both sides of the aisle should support: preserving land &amp; protecting our migratory birds.
It is my sincere hope this bill flies through the Senate and lands on the President's desk without delay.
We've had to ruffle some feathers to get to this point, but this legislation will do much to protect our migratory waterfowl and wetlands,
Hopefully this important bill doesn't fly under their radar.
Glad to see the Federal Duck Stamp Act of 2014 pass, the first increase since '91. Now, it's up to the Senate to act. http://t.co/yVbcaPKZQ1
