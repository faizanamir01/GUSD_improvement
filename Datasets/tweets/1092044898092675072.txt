@Lesperado1 But the Clinton investigation showed clear bias and collusion with investigators.  That’s not happening with Trump.  It’s sad, but justice isn’t blind.  Political elites are not treated equally under the law.
@Lesperado1 The only Russian connection that has been proven is between the Hillary campaign and  the Russians.  #factsmatter
@CNN Now do OBAMA!
@EdKrassen Jobs, booming economy, more liberty.  If that’s not giving a crap, he needs to give way less of a crap.  #winning #weownthelibs

This is the real goal.  Even in death @AOC won’t let you be.  This is disgusting. https://t.co/vy9TfGa1BJ
@AOC Are you looking at stealing someone’s lifetime of work?  That’s disgusting.
@Lesperado1 That’s true.  She does hate this county.
@Lesperado1 Because he’s corrupt justice department wouldn’t investigate him.  Did he know Hillary has a secret email server that was hacked by foreign actors.
@Lesperado1 That’s discrimitory.  Texas is the second largest state economy in the US.  Maybe the poor blue states need to learn something besides common core.
@Lesperado1 An American President colliding with the Russians to thwart the American citizen.  SAD!!! https://t.co/ed0WquTSBe
@Lesperado1 More facts!   Agh!  I know it must be frustrating to you.  Good day.  Obviously you are not willing to learn.  You have too much hate in your heart.  That’s not healthy.   https://t.co/lyYG7spiS5
@Lesperado1 I believe the states should decided the educational future of our kids.  No Washington.  Why is that a bad thing.  The federal government has no authority over that.
@Lesperado1 https://t.co/7ycDxZMFHD
@Lesperado1 Your really pushy in saying I don’t know what policies are.  You tell me.  How did deregulating that industry hurt the country?  I’ll wait
@Lesperado1 The department of education should be abolished and I don’t have time to debunk the rest of the opinion piece from a liberal mouth piece.
@Lesperado1 Cool story bro, tell me again after ‘net neutrality’ was repealed how internet speeds were slowed?
@Lesperado1 There’s a difference between oversight and over regulations.  Over regulations = slavery
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton 🤦🏼‍♂️ are you dumb or incompetent.  I don’t know which one.
@Lesperado1 Right, the freedom from regulatory burdens and government.
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton Obama doubles the debt of every other president.

@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton 😂 you’re pathetic.  Facts ⬆️ logic ⬆️ and you don’t care.  What a joke.
@Lesperado1 Unemployment at a historic low, stock market at a historic high, manufacturing jobs, blue collar jobs, lower taxes, less regulation.  This is a great economy. #Trump2020
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton Hillary paid a law firm (Perkins Coie) who paid a “research firm” (Fusion GPS) who paid paid a foreign intellegence Officer (Michael Steele) who paid some Russian intel officers for a unverified and salacious dossier. Those are facts, proven conspiracy to thwart American election
@Lesperado1 @EdKrassen Is @HillaryClinton going to pay more Russians to thwart our election? #weownthelibs
@EdKrassen You have obviously never read a history book.  No they wouldn’t.  The Congress is responsible for ‘trying’ the President through impeachment.  You’re a joke.  #weownthelibs

@ericswalwell By taking away legal and safe gun owners weapons, with your nukes?  You sadistic bastard, why do you hate America so much?
@EdKrassen So investigate people with no credible allegation of a crime?  Liberals really hate the constitution. #weownthelibs

@Lvteelix @abigailtracy @RepCummings @AOC @RepAOC For what?  Brainwashing an entire generation into thinking they are owed something or that socialism actually works?  Maybe you think we owe them for the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.  Maybe we owe them for not protecting our borders. #thanksbutnothanks
@RepCummings Do you think @LGJustinFairfax should replace him since he sexually assaulted a woman?
I don’t think we needed a poll to tell us what would happen. https://t.co/YaDz8llF3D

Do you even economics bro?  Europeam countries are capitalist with a heavy emphasis in welfare spending.  It’s often referred to as the Nordic Model.  🤦🏼‍♂️ it’s helpful to know what your taking about before you tweet.  #weownthelibs https://t.co/Tic7YL6HbH

@IlhanMN Can you try to understand how economics works?  It’s kind of you job now.
@AOC Tell that to @LGJustinFairfax
@TheDemocrats @staceyabrams Maybe she’ll talk about paying the IRS past taxes.  #weownthelibs

@thedailybeast This county was politically divided before Trump.  It started about the time the last #potus had a beer summit
@AOC Owners refuse to hire @Kaepernick7 because he’s a shifty QB.  And he hates America.

@elchsa @EdKrassen America has an aboindance of healthcare.  Our system worked great (before Obama Care) and no waitlist! I ❤️ the free market. #weownthelibs
@moravian63 @EdKrassen 1. It doesn’t work.  2. If you need surgery, you go on a wait list (good luck) 3. Medications are controlled by the government, meaning if there is a better medicine that the government hasn’t negotiated for you don’t get it. 4. It doesn’t work #weownthelibs
Look!  More dumb libs lying to Twitter.  What else would you expect.  #weownthelibs https://t.co/LlDPFRTkTz
@EdKrassen Fact is, it doesn’t work.  It’s expensive, lacks patient focused healthcare and prolongs wait times for the simplest treatments.  Medicare for all would be like going to the DMV for a cold.  How many Canadian companies hold patents in healthcare?  #thanksamerica #weownthelibs
@immrhodes123 @EdKrassen Because he paid for it.  It’s the best PRIVATE hernia center in North America.  Did I mention it’s not ran by the Canadian Health Care system.

@SvePan1108 @EdKrassen You meant to say truth.
@EdKrassen When did Donald Trump dress up in ‘Black Face’?
@EdKrassen Imagine if Trump witnessed a birth then decided if he should live.  That’s Northam.
@krassenstein So when he says there was no Russian Collusion you’ll finally shut up?  #hurryupmueller
