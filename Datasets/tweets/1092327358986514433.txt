@TJKillilea @TWallack @SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA @NECN Sorry you can’t tag him.  Twitter banned him (Russian troll account)
@SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA I love atheists.  So many Christians perform mental acrobatics to try to make sense of the Bible ... at least atheists are intellectually honest about it.		*Spoiler alert* 	The density of my body is greater than the density of water. That “walk on water” bit is blatantly bullshit
@SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA Oh I’m just now getting into the Twitter game.  I’m sure Twitter followers will come.  I mean, it took me like 2000 years to gain a few billion real life followers.
@SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA Compassion, followed by ... https://t.co/nwJEo6wSh0
@lyndagorov @SueNBCBoston @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA Hmm @SueNBCBoston is all talk until I show up.  Now crickets ...
@universalshow Gross ... You don’t have to pretend to like bad music to be a good Christian.  Just so you know
@SueNBCBoston @lyndagorov @TWallack @dankennedy_nu @JeffSemonMA How did this argument become about me?
@SueNBCBoston @JeffSemonMA @wbarry55 @dankennedy_nu Jesus is happy with you, Sue.

@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang Leave your church.  They’re teaching the wrong things ... apparently
@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang So sad.  You live with such hostility. With an attitude like yours, you must be a completely miserable person.  You poor poor thing.
@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang All the same reasons you need a phone
@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang Nope.  Just eating Sushi! I don’t always check my phone.		I’m glad you’ve spent so much energy thinking about me.  It seems you’ve started to turn your life toward me!  This is good.  		Maybe just work on being less needlessly hostile.  #DBAD (the golden rule)

Let’s be honest here.  You don’t actually KNOW I’m not Jesus.  You just think I’m not ... 		fortunately, your opinion doesn’t matter.  “Misusing the lords name” isn’t a violation of Twitter rules. https://t.co/1C2ZdoI0Ai

@EoinHiggins_ @LydiaBurrell Eoin
@KingGage_ Wait what?
@toddstarnes This dude has a weird obsession with me.
@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang Yeah, the Bible says a bunch of silly shit that’s obviously not true.  It was written by people, and translated a ton of times.		Ex: it also says that my dad created “light” 3 days before creating the sun and stars ... the only source of natural light available in the universe. https://t.co/83VbOTNSAe
@Alterdiem @JohnFugelsang How can you be so sure I’m not? ... be honest.  There’s no possible realistic scenario where you would believe I’m Jesus returning to mankind and not just a crazy person.

If that’s not the perception you are seeking, then perhaps you need to refine your message
@dallasnews @DENTONPD That escalated quickly
@CNNSotu @ninaturner @jaketapper @RepLizCheney @ChrisMurphyCT @PeteButtigieg @KenCuccinelli @MiaBLove @RepBarragan @CNN @cnni I believe @ninaturner is confused.

Frankly, my dad hasn’t been around much.  I would prefer if you focus more on love for one another https://t.co/OFJubE2OAw
The 21st! How could I live in any other century? https://t.co/aQdkb9ghz6
I will do no such thing, and I would appreciate if you kindly refrain from speaking on my behalf.  I have my own iPhone, sir. https://t.co/Rj9yABoJkV
Funny enough, she’s closer to correct than her grandmother. https://t.co/wdQbIjqCwc
@thehill Get your shit together Ayatolla.  Words matter
@thehill Holy dad
@CNN Blessed are the peacemakers who have the self restraint not to break this man’s neck and leave him in the streets
@WeAreFoursquare @calebbr0wn Take what Ashley and Caleb say with a grain of salt.  I stopped doing miracles a few thousand years ago.  They draw too much negative attention and don’t work nearly as well as one would think.
@StephenBaldwin7 Bro I just woke up.
@Sebatsane Not true.  I really don’t have that power
@DeplorableTere1 I don’t really command troops ... that King James Bible is like a translation of a translation of a translation.  You ever played telephone as a kid?
@huannalu Np 😊
@IngridDargin @2_fleurdelis @ashleighpeak @sacwriter Well I also wept when the patriots won.  I wouldn’t read too far into it
@CNN I think the danger here no longer requires a prophet to notice
@missremiashten @chrissyteigen https://t.co/HO16EDczXz
@AlixWiltonRegan @PedroPascal1 @jes_chastain Np 😊👍
@paulbaloche @RickLeeJames https://t.co/lRjm5Qwqwf
@lopezgovlaw @inthewordtweets Uhm.  That wasn’t me buddy.  Just thought you should know 🤙
@Slade I’m right here!  Why does everyone think I’m hiding?
@Mason_Foster https://t.co/uLob0BKhv2
@DonCheadle Prayers received, but this one is on him.
@madeintyo Meh.  I prefer actions over words
@iD4RO @marquisdecod Yo
@mhayoun @YouTube Lit
@MrPope @martiallawre @Rainbow6Game Right?
@moshekasher A bunch.  It’s kinda messed up
@BillyGraham No, sorry, I’m not in heaven.  Terrible WiFi up there
@brockwilbur @AutomaticZen Hmm?
@MattHoyOfficial OH, MY DAD! ... Its okay, just don’t overdo it.  :)
@McJuggerNuggets Why does everyone want me to drive their car?
@Jim_Brunner Yes?
@vikkie @danielatlarge Yes?
@Paula_White Hey leave me out of this.  Whatever it is
@BBPHredux @roybragg @Maria4America @NeilMaginnis @blaw @HillaryClinton I would ... if I was my dad.  You realize Allah is my dad right? God. He’s the same guy.		And to address your question, I needed to reword it.  I used the word scumbag, which I realized sounded repetitive.  So I changed it to “idiot”
@notreallyjcm @Alia_Stearns_ I don’t know what that word means, but whatever the definition, I will not kill you, my child
@EvanHandler I agree with the sentiment here, but I just licked my arm and can confirm that I am not sweet
@81TimBrown Oh yeah? Try drinking a gallon of milk in under an ten minutes and tell me if you still think all things are possible ... with or without my dad
@BrianZahnd @BryanMcWhite Honestly, you should trust anything based on a generalization like that. Trust things because you have evidence that they’re trustworthy
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot To be clear: I am NOT in, nor am I remotely interested in being in any kind of relationship with any of the Trump family.  I tend to surround myself with decent people
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot Ahh I remember that.  That meme was from my SOTU response
@roybragg @BBPHredux @Maria4America @NeilMaginnis @blaw @HillaryClinton Whoa whoa whoa ... don’t lump me in with that idiot.
@TrulyMonica I’m not in the business of giving rice or jobs actually.  I did the whole “fish to bread” thing, but that was just to make a point.  The big thing to remember is that there will always be suffering while people continue to suck ...
@ServicioTelcel @jesusrosalesPS Me puedes DM si eso es que quieres hacer.
@JerryFalwellJr @georgembenson @brettrlars I don’t recall writing anything in red pen.  Also, judging by the way you e lived your life, you haven’t really retained much of what I ever said, regardless of the color of the words.
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot It’s clear by her last name that Taste and Class were never a major priority
@TimDuffy Wait.  There’s a Me Lizard?
@JarridWilson Well sure, but please remember to mind common sense boundaries
@JaneyGodley @Grumpy_Patriot Not hate.  More of a firm Facepalm really.
@ServicioTelcel @jesusrosalesPS Hola @ServicioTelcel, no necesito que ... oh ... el otro Jesus. Lo siento
@JaneyGodley @IMXLR8N @AOC Yes, I do. But the golden rule (#DBAD) tends to go out the window frequently when you put a coward behind the anonymity of a keyboard
@JeffreeStar @elfcosmetics The dry heat of Mesopotamia made it so that no amount of makeup can make this face look young again
@thehill My dad created mankind such that they will speak many different languages ... Perhaps in another language “great” means Shameful, and “political” means Prison
@lisamurkowski @CaptainAmerica @ChrisEvans Jesus approves
@KatrinaPierson Thank you @KatrinaPierson for embodying the perfect example of what a human should not be.  We need crude humans like yourself so we  have something to strive not to be. https://t.co/u1TqLLIrz2
@diarvr Indeed I am flattered.   But it should be about YOU!
@nels668 I can confirm
@ida712 A+ for enthusiasm!
@TheAlchemiist_ 💯
@thehill Thou shalt always seem like a cheerleader
@CNN I predict a lot of false witness bearing
@stariotype @ArianaGrande I can confirm that such a depiction is inaccurate
@KhaiAchak I hope not.  This is writing.  There’s really nothing to hear
@TheJesusSayings “Not suicide” is also a pretty good answer
@God_Loved It’s actually pretty easy most of the time.
@mel_melay I’m wha?
@HarrietKavere Haha victory? Well there was this one time...	✋✋🔨🔨😵☠️👻🧖‍♂️😇
@KhaiAchak Just to be clear.  The happenchance designs you can make by playing dot-to-dot with the stars from our position in the Galaxy has zero influence on human personalities
@SaucyBalboa https://t.co/nkfJrTpPLz
@vincestaples I don’t see it.  He’s short af
@judahsmith And tweeting.  Don’t forget tweeting
@RealTalkKim https://t.co/J3AYQkI4Fl
@bambamdaily Oh that’s not my mom, but neat pic!
@zeyadyeah1997 @jk_rowling Why? That’s the idea behind fantasy.  It takes your mind to a made up world.  I already have thousands of books about me.
@AKIslander @MadCornishBiker Am I not responding to you in near live time? It’s okay @MadCornishBiker, I love you despite your atheism
Remember the golden rule:	Don’t be a douche #DBAD
@GLYCERlNEQUEEN You know what they say:  Thou shalt never go broke gassing up
@MadCornishBiker @JelicalIvan You are misguided my child
@JelicalIvan @MadCornishBiker Nah, I keep my DM’s open for prayers tho
@MadCornishBiker @JelicalIvan I try not to hate anyone.  I have to try extra hard with Donald trump.  But as a general rule, what you just claimed is incorrect
Be honest with yourself.  You don’t know that for sure.  Belief requires faith. https://t.co/SO5W9UFPdy
@JelicalIvan @MadCornishBiker Prayers.  Common misconception there ... I can’t hear those.
@MadCornishBiker @JelicalIvan No he’s for real.  I entered him a while back.  I just try to avoid eye contact so it isn’t weird
@217_0398 @YouTube One of my favorite YouTube channels.  Best of luck, other me!
@TiernanDouieb @johnbeck_ Yeah?
@debostic Amen, friend
@cosmickissy https://t.co/NdGn607cOL
@KirkDeveyck Yeah but I don’t get hung up on titles.
@aimusa That’s objectively untrue
@rcsprouljr Jesus thinks you don’t understand what secularism is, and that you’ve confused it with atheism.  In any case, quit being so judgy. #DBAC
@GenuinelyEmilie Hold up a sec.  I’m not exactly a home security system, if that’s what you mean
@wooby_yt You’ll do great!
@ChirayilJoseph Where?
We got beef? https://t.co/OH2YPstuQ1
@lynne_windy I wish I could.  Best of luck to you my friend!
@StephNGColace_ Sweet indeed
@zeyadyeah1997 @jk_rowling I don’t need a shoutout in her books.  They were fantastic just the way they were written
@RellonRosalia I don’t need warriors. I’m not a general.  My only desire is #DBAC
@KassyDillon Sorry but that wasn’t me
@iamdannettalynn Woot! Thanks for the follow!
@iheartscripture Nah not really.  That’s not what he does at all
@WhoLisaFrm503 I’ve never been to prison.  I think he’s just easily excited!
@anotolefrank Idk man.  It’s not looking good
@simplyih https://t.co/7lMLVpUbZD
@jaay_eeym I’m sorry, but I have no control over that.  So work fast, friend!
@The_Jester66 Right?!
@KaylaPenner1 Hardly perfect
@kusump_ Oh dem tittays! I always look good in red
@mariah_ely I’m no king.  Let’s be friends instead
@simplyih Aww thank you! You’re amazing too!
@LydiaBeck18 I love atheists too.  You should try it.  You have to admit:  Dad didn’t leave much to hang your faith on.
@Queen_amerella @exotic_vibes_ My dad didn’t let you.  You let you!  Happy birthday :)
@Christwarriors5 You don’t need a church to be a good person.
@HarleyJuneDavi1 Honestly, probably not.
@GLYCERlNEQUEEN Sweet, right?!
@dionhannahross I beg unto thee, never forget the necessity of the comma
@CLAOutcomes @greglaurie No, I really don’t.  My dad hasn’t really been in the picture for a while.  That was my whole point ... it’s on you to be a better person:  You can do eet!	#DBAC
@demetricka @Paula_White You’re welcome :)
@RobChalmers7 Good job!
@_Rannnnnn Nonfollowers too.
@livechristian1 My core message is simple: #DBAC
@lozzy1080p60fps Wtf, weeb? What did I do?
@StephKVE Yes?
@fuckualc @tylerrjoseph Jesus needs to check these dudes out
@kjgranny2050 Um no.  Your “self” is pretty important.  Just be your best self
@DrTumisang Most of you*		Fixed it for you
@JourneyOfPureBl I love you too man
@PokeTrainerCard @maxcension Rofl https://t.co/ADmXyDyie9
@ShapedByTruth Meh.  Doesn’t really work that way.
@brighttseokj https://t.co/TnfpmIEXbN
@The_Gospels Not exactly.  I died because people, as a general rule, suck
@holybibletoday I’m not exactly everyone’s personal Walmart associate, if that’s what you’re implying.
@MyPowertalk Jesus agrees
@seanhannity Sean, thank you for being a shining example to humanity of everything I never wanted humans to become
@thehill Jesus declares this act to be a genuinely dick move
@NBCNews Sorry, my dad is kind of a prick
@CBSNews Jesus approves of Julian Edelman.
@ABCWorldNews @TerryMoran What percentage of that percentage is  spent wanking? Asking for a friend ...
@CBCNews Possibility is much less of a concern than probability
@RepLeeZeldin @DonaldJTrumpJr @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerPelosi Thou shalt not have a name which so resembles Led Zeppelin
@citykittymo1 @WCVB Dad is a Patriots fan.  Not much of a Patriots-fan-fan though, regrettably.
@FleeceWings @Samgabbi1 He doesn’t do that.  Trust me, your happiness is all on you
@deemick7 @KayaJones @elzieim29 My dad is the most annoying Patriots fan in the world. I know that much is obvious, but you should try going to one of his fucking super bowl parties 🙄
@Elaineocgp @DanCrenshawTX Unfortunately, your prayers in my name will not help this situation. 		More donating and/or spreading this link ... less talking into thin air to make yourself feel like you’ve helped.
@e_sakamoto25 Don’t worry about your thoughts wandering.  Nobody is listening.  Not even me.  What matters is the self reflection, wherever that may lead
@its_not_jason Thou shalt not punish fun
@LaurenArredondo He really doesn’t listen.  But for what it’s worth, I wish you the best.
@saladinahmed Dare thy criticize literacy by wielding a lengthy run-on sentence as a weapon?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Before judging the bullshit of others, you must first remove the bullshit from your own eye
@usnews Just because apparently my biographies weren’t clear enough: Keep thy hands off little kids, you fucks.
@thehill Judge not, lest thy own immature, decades old decisions be judged as well
@ABC Trust me Donnie, you’re not the god you think you are.  Even my dad is a pretty shitty god.  You’re just embarrassing
@CNN Jesus approves.
@CBSNews Idk what you guys did to impress my dad, but I’d appreciate if you’d let me know
@thehill Sorry, my dad is kind of a prick
@norvina1 Always love thy fellow fry eaters, regardless of their chosen method of fry consumption.  Fry minimalism is an honorable choice
@realDonaldTrump My dear Donald, you’re forgetting the Golden Rule.  Revised for 2019, it goes like this:	Quit being such a cunt ...
@JoeNBC I think @realDonaldTrump thinks he’s my dad.
The #StateOfTheUnion is an interesting ritual.  Union.  I tried to unite people, and we all know how that shit-show ended. 🤕	@realDonaldTrump will try to divide people in the name of “union” and walk away hand-nail free ... Humans don’t seem to want unity.
@bryanbehar I can vouch. My dad is a huge Brady fan. Imagine watching the game with a guy who can actually yell at the TV and affect the game ... Super Bowl parties with him are bullshit
@marcorubio Don’t trust him bro.  I’m telling you.  ✋🔨
