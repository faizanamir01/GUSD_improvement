One of the more radical and interesting possible ways to limit the power of unaccountable media barons is to give journalists the power to elect editors and have seats on boards for workers and consumers when a title or programme gets particularly large and influential.
For all the worry about new forms of fake news, most people think our newspapers churn out fake news day in, day out.		It’s hardly a surprise in the last 4 years one political earthquake after another has been missed by most of our media.
We must break the stranglehold of elite power and billionaire domination over large parts of our media. 		Just three companies control 71% of national newspaper circulation and 5 companies control 81% of local newspaper circulation.
Print too often sets the broadcast agenda, even though it is wedded so firmly to the Tories politically and to corporate interests more generally. 		Just because it's on the front page of The Sun or the Mail doesn't automatically make it news. #ChangeTheMedia

Congratulations to @ImranKhanPTI, sworn in yesterday as Pakistan’s Prime Minister. 		We give our support to the people of Pakistan, and hope that the new government can deliver social justice and help build a country that works for all.
Kofi Annan dedicated his life to building a more just and peaceful world. 		His efforts in support of conflict resolution and human rights will be remembered. He looked for a peaceful path when others looked for war.		My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.
Happy Parsi New Year to people celebrating in India and around the world.		The first Parsi and Indian MP Dadabhai Naoroji was elected in 1892 in Central Finsbury, now the Borough of Islington which I represent.		He dedicated his life to fighting for India's independence.

When I last asked @Theresa_May about school cuts at #PMQs she said the Tories are "ensuring that there is more money available".		We know that's not true, but will she listen now teachers at one of her local schools are begging her for basic equipment? 	https://t.co/CJkNof97LU

The next Labour government will ensure everyone has a home to call their own. We will fix the housing crisis by building a million new homes, the majority will be social housing and genuinely affordable, as we build a country for the many, not the few. #EndHomelessness
Labour will introduce radical, ground-breaking policies that tackle homelessness head on, making 8,000 new homes available for people with a history of rough sleeping. #EndHomelessness
As Prime Minister I will personally lead a task force to end rough sleeping by the end of the next Parliament, working across government to make the links between housing, health, social security and work. #EndHomelessness https://t.co/wLsBEVVhmD
Today, @Crisis_UK released research showing that an average of three homeless people have died every week since last October.		That's someone’s child, parent or friend dying needlessly because our Government hasn't got the political will to #EndHomelessness. https://t.co/3GX9gA7SQd
There are 236,000 people who are homeless in the UK. 		It is simply inexcusable that in Britain, one of the richest countries in the world, we are still failing to give everyone a decent and secure place to live. #EndHomelessness https://t.co/K09bUggIuS

Disgraceful. While these 100,000 families wait for a home for over a decade, most are stuck in overcrowded, expensive and insecure accommodation. 		The Tories have refused to build the social housing we need, meaning numbers have fallen to a record low.		https://t.co/QRapMSL7nu

The UK Government must now listen to campaigners and launch an independent inquiry into the brutal clashes between police and miners during the strike in 1984, not least at Orgreave where so many questions still need to be answered.
The convictions of nearly 500 Scottish miners devastated not only their lives, but those of their families too while also scarring pit communities until this day.		This review must establish if these arrests and convictions were unjust and politically motivated.
I welcome the Scottish Government's announcement that there will be an independent review into the actions of the police during the miners' strike in Scotland.		I pay tribute to the campaigners and my colleague @NeilFindlay_MSP who have fought tirelessly to make this happen.
But, the @Conservatives have rigged our system in favour of a privileged elite. The next Labour government will transform our country so it works for the many, not the few.
Make no mistake, Britain has the wealth and resources to organise our economy so everyone can lead a decent life, with a home to call their own, a job that pays enough for them to live on, with access to education and the opportunities to succeed.
I read this article this morning and it made me shudder with anger.		One person going hungry in the sixth richest country in the world is wrong. But four million people having to use foodbanks is absolutely shocking.		https://t.co/ONbzUKn4aj
It's clearer than ever that paying private companies to deliver public services and projects has completely failed.		The @Conservatives' obsession with outsourcing has not only put services at risk, it is costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.		https://t.co/kzxr1vUu0R
50 years ago today, a historic strike took place which led to a watershed moment in the fight for gender equality.		187 machinists at Ford’s Dagenham plant walked out and onto the picket line because they were being paid less than their male colleagues.		https://t.co/dtyUtYq4wF https://t.co/ef7iSMuP0o

Taxpayers saved RBS after bankers drove our economy off a cliff. 		Instead of selling off our shares in RBS, the Government should use our stake to stop the closure of local bank branches that people rely on, cutting jobs and hitting rural communities. 		https://t.co/VsFK2eqET5

Great news that the Republic of Ireland has voted to #Repealthe8th to support a woman’s right to choose. 		Congratulations to everyone who has taken part in this inspiring campaign and to everyone who travelled home to vote. A fantastic victory for women’s rights.
Yesterday I visited the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.		The Tories’ reckless approach to Brexit risks dividing communities.		Labour will negotiate a new customs union to prevent a hard border to secure peace and prosperity. https://t.co/m6murZjvB3
This week marks 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement referendum. 		Yesterday, I spoke at Queen’s University, Belfast, about the need to revive the spirit of the Agreement and prevent the return to a hard border, to protect peace and ensure prosperity for the many not the few. https://t.co/aCt4cOz2B9

The Thatcher government's Section 28 law was a grim moment in our country’s history.		Despite continuing Tory support, @UKLabour scrapped it in 2003. But we still have a long way to go. https://t.co/oun9WRQmw0
Fascinating to visit Lagan College, the first integrated school, bringing Catholic and Protestant students together.		Founded in 1981, it's now the most oversubscribed school in Northern Ireland. A great symbol of how communities can work together for the common good. https://t.co/rnfcRRZB1t
Let’s work together in the spirit of friendship and hope.		As Seamus Heaney once wrote:		History says, Don’t hope	On this side of the grave,	But then, once in a lifetime	The longed-for tidal wave	Of justice can rise up,	And hope and history rhyme.
Tomorrow I will be visiting the border to talk to those communities who would be most affected by any change to the current arrangements.		Let's not give up years of hard fought stability for the pipe dream of race-to-the-bottom free trade deals with the likes of Donald Trump.
Political parties in Westminster must do more. I call on the UK Government to reconvene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.		We must find a creative solution that avoids a return to direct Westminster rule and lays the ground for further progress for all communities.
Labour is as committed to the Good Friday Agreement as ever.		It has served us for 20 years and will provide us with the framework for the next 20 and beyond.		We must do all we can to make power sharing work again in Stormont. We need all sides to come together.
The agreement was built on the back of the spirit of the men and women of these communities, no longer willing to tolerate pain and division.		We need that spirit again if we want 20 more years and beyond of peace and greater prosperity.
I’m in Northern Ireland and have just spoken about how 20 years ago, the vote by the people here and in the Republic to accept the Good Friday Agreement changed the course of history and opened the door to peace. https://t.co/nhIaeTaI5I

My thoughts are with the victim's family and those affected by last night's stabbing in Islington.		Thank you to the emergency services and everyone who helped, including St Mary's church that stayed open as a Council rest centre through the night to provide shelter and support.
A year since the Manchester Arena terror attack, we think of the 22 people who were killed, their loved ones, the injured and an entire city that came together in love and strength in the face of great tragedy. #ManchesterTogether

Our NHS mental health services must get the funding they so desperately need.		And we must continue to talk about mental health to break the stigma and tackle its causes by transforming the economy so it genuinely includes everybody and excludes nobody. #MHAW
Too many workers endure stress in toxic work environments or face job insecurity, with many more worried about debts, rent or mortgages, not knowing how they will make ends meet at the end of the month.
What makes these discussions important is our determination to make people’s lives better.		And as it's #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek, I talked about how a perfect storm of economic pressures is feeding a mental health epidemic that costs our economy almost £100 billion a year.
Today I spoke at @UKLabour’s #StateOfTheEconomy conference, bringing people together to discuss and develop our plans to transform our economy so it works for the many, not the few. https://t.co/7ooPkpOGtL

Our elderly are neglected for lack of social care. Decent people who have contributed all their lives are not being given the dignity in retirement they deserve.		It doesn’t have to be like this. Labour in government would do things very differently. https://t.co/hcNRNNEpso
On Thursday 3 May you can send this Tory Government a message to say enough of cuts to our police force.		There are 20,000 fewer police on our streets since 2010 and today the police inspectorate is warning that 999 calls are sometimes not responded to for days. https://t.co/pY2tkOwIyb
The country’s housing crisis is deepening. It’s a crisis that has left 120,000 children in temporary accommodation without a home to call their own. That’s up two-thirds since 2010.		Labour will build the homes people need and ensure developers build genuinely affordable housing. https://t.co/6840lNnl9Z
Over the last eight years, the Tories have cut councils’ budgets in half.		In that same time, the Tories have slashed corporation tax, cut the bank levy, abolished the top tax rate on high earners and cut capital gains tax for the very richest.		Austerity is a political choice. https://t.co/KDcqkbjKUV
In the local elections on Thursday 3 May you will be able to send a message to this Government to say: enough of cuts to vital services that hurt local communities, enough of cuts to schools, hospitals and local policing. https://t.co/qFnjobjM4I
