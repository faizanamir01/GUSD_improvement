@T_Cooper3 @hxmxtty I’m sorry for getting his name wrong, to be fair, he commented on a random kids tweet. Because we didn’t know who he was, we only had his twitter profile to work with. Since Cletus was his twitter name, that’s what we assumed.

@TheTrapliff @Walker_Coleman1 Fair enough
@TheTrapliff @Walker_Coleman1 Do not liken yourself to God.
@Walker_Coleman1 My feelings aren't hurt about this, because I'm straight, so you are 100% correct. However, many members of the LGBT community are hurt by your comments because of the hate they've had to suffer in their lives because of their orientation.
@Walker_Coleman1 @somevelvets @macelynvictoria @robbstterrr @Grammarly That fails to invalidate my point.
@Walker_Coleman1 @somevelvets @macelynvictoria @robbstterrr @Grammarly Kiss me
Just as you have the right to express your opinion, people have the right to respond. LGBT people chose to express this right by sharing their experience of being in that community. Many people were hurt by the insensitive comments you made and they felt the need to respond. https://t.co/2S8DDlIt57
@Walker_Coleman1 @somevelvets @macelynvictoria @robbstterrr Also, I've noticed you have a severe amount of typos in your tweets. Consider using @Grammarly before submitting your tweets, your arguments will appear more sound when they're grammatically correct.

@tworley046 The republicans are split between a trump wing and a more conservative wing, while it’s fair to say that democrats have played some role in the government shutdown it’s ridiculous to claim that they’re the only reason when the republicans have a majority within congress.
@tworley046 I agree the only thing to be blamed is the division within the Republican Party
@tworley046 Woah that’s quite the claim, I guess republicans were the only reason for the government shutdown of 2013 too. I mean it’s not like the entire government is run by republicans right now or anything.
