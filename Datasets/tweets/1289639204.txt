In this country the 1% controls the 98% we need to do a lot more than keep shouting the obvious. What are our action steps? Where is the strategic plan? We need to do different. If we don’t want another dictator in office we cant have a dictatorial system. #ElectoralCollege https://t.co/P26JfQDM0r
Shouldn’t we have a set-base of values that ensures/protects the wellbeing of all lives? Why are issues that affect us all left at the mercy of every changing administration? If we want things to be different, we need to do something different #HumansBeforePartyLines #WeThePeople
We need to steer the conversation in a different direction in our country. It’s time for a new way of governance all together. Should policies about Healthcare, Education and Criminal Justice Reform be left to any one party ideals? These are humanitarian issues-not party issues.
This is not just about ineffective leadership but also ineffective policies. A perfect example of why free healthcare is a HUMANITARIAN issue. We need to address both-our ineffective leadership and ineffective policies. https://t.co/vJPDWM2uHW https://t.co/iwtSed9OOO

I know it's easier to think that @kanyewest has lost his mind than to focus on the deeper message- which is love &amp; the emancipation of mental slavery.

Puerto Rico has been politically raped 4over a century. Ravished by politicians bc of a lack of leadership.  Just bc some are making noise 4the past 3mo doesn't make anyone or any one party the hero. It's been a fkn century in the making of this devastation! Noise is just noise. https://t.co/N6lN73YU80
There are individuals-Rep &amp; Dems alike-that have truly cared 4our island. Not the leadership in Florida who now seek out vote, but clearly not the democrats that think tweets, photo ops &amp; press conferences is enough. IT IS NOT ENOUGH. We must not give our power away. #LeadersNow https://t.co/K8VIJpEwdG
