RT if you think a #TaxHike when unemployment has been over 8% for 41 straight months is a bad idea
I hope that the President will heed calls from both parties to re-think this #TaxHike on our job-creators
The 23 million Americans struggling for work can't afford a longer hiring freeze #TaxHike
Even talk about a #TaxHike paralyzes business, as the uncertainty about economic burdens stops owners from hiring
Small businesses drive our economy, providing some 55 percent of private sector jobs #TaxHike
The President is proposing a #TaxHike that would slam small businesses when they can least afford it -- and when we need them the most
