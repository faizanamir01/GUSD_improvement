Lord, please let me not have to “fall into a cave” to hear your voice. Not saying that’s what God was accomplishing with the boys. Just using the analogy for my spiritual life. Sometimes I can’t “hear God”, but I know He is talking, so I press on &amp; stand still so I can hear Him.
I can’t even imagine being the mother of one of these boys. I would smother my son for life. Ice-cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This has been nerve wrecking to watch. The coach and his team can do motivational speeches for life. God is good. #LifeOfAcoach #ThaiCaveRescue https://t.co/aAfJXLWrEs

@smugglets_ sounds good to me! Come through. Bring your data. Don't  speak off rumors. People make things up all the time.
@_KickSand Our dorms are next. That request came directly from our student body. I didn't ignore it. I listen and I make the changes.
@_KickSand I am paying close attention to everything we need to fix on campus. I like nice things. I want our students to have nice things.
@_KickSand One doesn't compete with the other. Some fixes yield a quicker return on investment and are done according to strat plan.
@_KickSand Definitely not. That would be discriminatory. We can't do that at all. Would never do that.
@_KickSand Our AD is doing so simultaneously. The soccer club is not a CIAA team. Doesn't come with the same expenditures. Major difference.
@smugglets_  2 students were in my office at 8:30AM before I flew out. Have you requested an appt? I'm not aware of a waiting list.
@__teamDY @smugglets_ The gym floor has a lifetime that has expired. Athletes get injured if the padding isn't adequate. We're fixing it.
@smugglets_ I was on a plane. Just seeing your tweets. As I said, come to see me. Bring all the questions you have and I will answer.
@smugglets_ Its a soccer club, not a CIAA team. If you need deets, my door is always open.
@smugglets_ @ShawBears Our Athletics Dept. is being restructured. The Athletic Director is communicating with everyone. We came to #win.
@_KickSand what's the question?
@smugglets_ I haven't cut any athletics programs. Not sure where u r getting this from.
