Need more inspiration? How about hearing from 18-year-old 	Grant Starr who tells us he found inspiration in the Parkland high school students: “I have to vote because I have a very clear idea of the moral system that I want my society to be based on." 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
At 57, Elizabeth Tucker registered to vote for the first time this year: “Politics was never a part of my life—and I didn’t want it to be ... I’m neither Democrat or Republican, but I feel like I’m stuck in the middle of chaos." 💪🏼💪🏼
Steve Rapport became a US citizen in February: "It’s time to put my money where my mouth is and to become a part of this democratic process. A lot of people ask me why I would [become a citizen] now, and I say, ‘Now, is why I want to do it.’" 💪🏼
