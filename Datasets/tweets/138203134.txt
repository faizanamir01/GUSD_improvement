We can have ideological differences and that’s fine. But these tactics allow a small group to force the other 200+ members into actions that the majority disagree with. I don’t think that’s right, and said as much in a closed door meeting.
Mind you, the same small splinter group of Dems that tried to deny Pelosi the speakership, fund the wall during the shutdown when the public didn’t want it, &amp; are now voting in surprise ICE amendments to gun safety legislation are being called the “moderate wing” of the party.
If you’re mad that I think people SHOULD KNOW when Dems vote to expand ICE powers, then be mad.		ICE is a dangerous agency with 0 accountability, widespread reporting of rape, abuse of power, + children dying in DHS custody.		Having a D next to your name doesn’t make that right.
#MomsDemand &amp; #MarchForOurLives activists, who flew in from across the country, were watching from the gallery, crying + confused.		I ran up to them *during the vote* and explained that the gotcha amendment pinned gun safety against immigration advocacy. Its intent was to divide.
What I DID say was that I had to go back to my district &amp; share the MTR vote to explain why a pro-ICE amendment was slipped into a gun safety law.		Maybe they’re mad bc I don’t believe pro-ICE expansion votes should be cast in the dark, and people deserve to know what happened.
“At [DHS immigrant detention] facility, children recounted being held down for forcible injections, which medical records show are powerful antipsychotics and sedatives.” 		https://t.co/mEmgTmQlIT

There was little in the fuzzy proposal that guaranteed jobs for actual NYers, yet lots of hard concessions from the public.		Queens saw how the FoxConn/Wisconsin disaster is working out - a $4.5 billion nightmare - &amp; asked Qs.		The response? “This is above you, you won’t get it.”

Finally, the reason we scope out with a resolution is bc I am not here to say that only one member of Congress will solve a global crisis.		Think of the GND Res as a “Request for Proposals.”		We’ve defined the scope and where we want to go. Now let’s assess + collab on projects.
And part of what the #GreenNewDeal says, at last, is that Flint wasn’t an accident.	The folks dying in West Virginia aren’t an accident.	The Bronx having one of the highest child asthma rates isn’t an accident.		It’s a structural failure to care, &amp; treat these communities fairly.
The pipes in Flint weren’t a market failure, they were a social failure.		It was a failure to see the people in Flint as important as the WH. Those decisions were predicated on a legacy of racism + dehumanization of the poor.		The enviro issue of water is how that was expressed.
For far too long, ideas like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to climate change.		While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer.		The pipes in Flint weren’t a “market failure.”
“Climate change is not a market glitch to be fixed through pricing... but part of a dire social crisis.”		The GND Resolution’s purpose is to *define the scope* of a climate solution.		Now, from investing into battery tech to fixing water pipes, we can draft projects in the plan. https://t.co/q9faiP2dUA

It does not mean the treatment + presumption of guilt before a verdict. It does not mean we aim for the most punitive punishment.		It means that in the eyes of the law, we treat everyone the same.		That’s far from what our current system does. And that’s why it must change.
As a result, our system is “innocent until proven guilty” only for the rich &amp;“guilty until proven innocent” for the poor.		To borrow from @ZephyrTeachout, the RADICAL rule of law is the idea that in the same scenario, our courts would treat a billionaire the same as a Bronx teen.
All too often, our criminal justice system - from tickets to convictions - is treated as a game, where the one racks up the most “points” wins.		Paired w/ foolish criminalization of marijuana, poverty,etc, it wrecks chaos on people’s lives + stagnates communities for generations.
Rikers Island is in my district.		Due to Census law, people incarcerated at Rikers are counted as my constituents (instead of at their home community).

@brianstelter @EJRaoulduke1976 Classic example is asking an innocent person “when was the last time you hit your dog?”		They say, “never!” But the frame was invoked.

@brianstelter @EJRaoulduke1976 I do think it’s important to note that questions advance certain frames. What 45 *does* understand is that if he can get media to invoke his narrative enough, people will start to believe or operate in it, regardless of truth. Perfect example is the caravan.

@brianstelter Got it! Look forward to joining you all sometime (for what it’s worth, I think we use social media very differently as well. He’s got more of an “man yells at cloud” thing going on 😉)

Quote tweet got deleted, but - 		I believe workers should enjoy more of the wealth they create, &amp; that democracy belongs in the workplace, too.		GOP believes people should be paid the lowest wages possible, no matter what they produce, so billionaires can scoop up the difference.
If you want to read more on the issue of monopolies, anti-trust, corruption, and ways to address it, I recommend checking out @ZephyrTeachout. 		She literally wrote the book on it.
The fact of the matter is the current monopoly trend is societally &amp; economically unsustainable.		We can’t simply accept the cliché that “journalism is dying.”		Journalism will only die if we choose not to fight for it - and if journalism dies, our democracy will, too.
Most platforms currently have 0 incentive to disseminate high-quality, true information.		In fact, FB *paid* for info tied to conspiracy theories on those demanding for accountability.		It matters. Soros was the 1st to get mailed a bomb last year.		https://t.co/zaf6NpmKPm
Gonna keep it 💯: The biggest threats to journalism right now are tech monopolies &amp; concentration of ownership.		Healthy democracy *requires* high-quality journalism.		W/o a wide range of independent outlets &amp; the revenue to sustain them, our democracy will continue to crumble.

This reinforces lazy tropes about women leaders in media:	- Older + seasoned, but unlikeable	- Passionate, but angry	- Smart, but crazy	- Well-intentioned, but naive	- Attractive, but uninformed or gaffe-prone		It’s unoriginal, lazy, and men don’t get the same either/or coverage.

Lastly, we wouldn’t need to talk about bathrooms at all if we acted like adults, washed our hands + minded our own business instead of trying to clock others.		Going by track record, I’d feel safer in a bathroom w/ a trans woman than a powerful male executive any day of the week.
This stuff infects some Democrats, too. Because in our overall discourse, nonviolent protest somehow gets deemed as not “civil,” yet stripping women’s rights or incarcerating children on the border doesn’t receive the same characterization. 		What’s up with that?🕵🏽‍♀️
Just look at the marginal tax rate discussion.		The right’s biggest strategy against my marginal tax rate proposal isn’t to argue against it - it‘s to lie about it, and imply that it’s a tax on all income, bc that helps their characterization of me as a “crazy/dumb“ Latina woman.
If you notice, on the right they’ll flatly call people blanket terms, and even make things up. And I don’t mean trolls - I mean their biggest commentators + TV figures.		This is different from criticizing a specific take you disagree with, or pointing out discriminatory patterns.
This has deeper consequences, bc as we’ve seen w/ narratives advanced by the right, they have trouble recognizing intelligence in people they disagree with.		This is what bias looks like: for some ppl, small mistakes mean they’re not “serious,” yet others are forgiven for worse.
Let’s dig into “gravitas,” bc it’s an ambiguous word, selectively applied.		Ever wonder how expression that’s feminine, working-class, queer, or poc isn’t deemed as having “gravitas,” but talking like an Aaron Sorkin character does? 🤔		Men have “gravitas,” women get “likeable.” https://t.co/0g9FNpExAl

It’s a huge win. Obviously there is work to do - there are other money committees (Ways &amp; Means, Energy &amp; Commerce, etc). But we’ve got one down. Before we had 0.		Keep paying attention, chipping into campaigns, and being activists. It works.
I cannot stress how important this moment is.		Dems are putting members who rejected corporate campaign money on a committee overseeing Wall St.		All because: 	1. Everyday people donated to our campaigns, and	2. They started to pay attention + became activists in Congress
These legislators, under public pressure, couldn’t deliver as much for big bank lobbyists.		They had to vacate one of the most powerful committees in the House. That made a space that big banks couldn’t fill, and how we got *several* non-Corp funded members into places of power.
All of a sudden, it became harder for legislators to slip corporate-friendly legislation through committee, because people would write articles and their constituents would find out and grow upset.		As I’ve said before, it’s People vs Money. We’ve got people, they’ve got money.
All of a sudden, normal people whose student loans were bubbling, whose mortgages were underwater, and so on, started showing up to committee hearings.		Including this guy: Monopoly Man		The idea was to show legislators that everyday people were watching.	https://t.co/YU4Bw8P1Sg
Fin Services is one of few exclusive committees.		The jargon around here is that they are the “money committees,” not bc they oversee money,but bc one can fundraise from special interests by sitting on it and giving corporations a listening ear.		Until people started paying attn.
Activists zoomed in on one place in particular: the Financial Services Committee, which deals with big banks, real estate, and almost every interaction people have in dealing with their own money.		What they found was a place where big bank lobbyists were slipping in their work.
During + after the 2008 financial crisis, everyday people started to viscerally see the corrosive role of lobbyists writing in legal loopholes that allowed big banks to gamble with people’s lives and the economy as a whole.		Occupy Wall Street emerged, and activism bloomed.
I want to be very clear about how successful the work of grassroots organizers and activists have been in helping Progressives secure appointments to the powerful Financial Services Committee.		It starts, as w/ many amazing developments, w/ everyday people paying attention. https://t.co/oKBI0OXCAz

It *must* be said in a nuanced conversation that questioning where takes come from is nowhere near the same as undermining the extraordinary work reporters and journalists do as “fake news.”		Helping people understand where these takes come from help guard against those attacks.
@GlennKesslerWP @washingtonpost I’m not challenging that I was checked - I think the check is a very fair one to masked, and that the coverage illuminated the issue far more than my tweet did. 		I *am* confused by the equivalence of the check to other similarly-rated claims that seem much more severe.
Fact-checking is critically important. It’s not always fun. But that’s okay! It pushes me to be better.		It’s important that if fact-checkers are referees, everyone know the rules - and those rules be as clear + fair as possible for all to play.		Thank you for the work you do. https://t.co/LGfd6pOReX

Or why did @washingtonpost give my confusing tweet on military accounting offsets the same “Pinocchios” as Trump’s flat denial of how many Americans died in Puerto Rico?		These are legitimate questions not intended to attack. Who makes these decisions? How? Is there a rubric?
For example, it looks like @PolitiFact has fact-checked Sarah Huckabee Sanders and myself the *same* amount of times: 6.		She’s been serving for almost 2 years. I’ve served 4 days.		Why is she fact-checked so little? Is she adhering to some standard we don’t know about?
Facts are facts, America. We should care about getting things right. Yet standards of who gets fact-checked, how often + why are unclear.		This is where false equivalency+bias creeps in, allowing climate deniers to be put on par w/scientists, for example.	https://t.co/87c6kVzIuI

We must keep pushing on a #GreenNewDeal.		We simply don’t have any other choice. If it’s radical to propose a solution on the scale of the problem, so be it.		We’ve got a planet to save and there’s a whole lot of opportunity we can create in the process.
While I applaud the establishment of the Select Committee, without subpoena power or the reasonable requests stated, it will be in an even weaker position than the select climate committee of 10 years ago.		There is still time to strengthen it. For all our sake,I hope that we do.
In DC + even in our own party, it‘s apparently too controversial to ask that we keep oil+gas co’s away from enviro policy.		It’s too controversial to talk about the socioeconomics of Flint, WV, PR &amp; the Bronx.		It’s too controversial to plan for disasters that are already here.
A few weeks ago, I joined youth activists in a specific demand for a Green New Deal Committee.		It had 3 simple elements:	1. No fossil fuel money on climate cmte	2. Offer solutions for impacted communities	3. Draft sample #GreenNewDeal		All 3 were rejected as “too controversial.”
Very proud of the young people across the country organizing #GreenNewDeal direct actions on their own.		They will not be placated with ceremonial gestures. They want change.

RT @transscribe: This is also a frustration of mine with DC reporting. You’ll notice my reporting rarely if ever includes anonymous sources…
The story about Rep. Pallone + I getting into a “fight” in caucus was 100% false as well.		This is why public gets confused - &amp; 45 exploits that confusion.		How about a learning moment - honest question so readers can distinguish: when is a journalist required to cite a source? https://t.co/SWHKjteR7m
@Grace_Segers It’s simply not true. The story about Pallone getting into a “fight” in caucus was completely untrue as well.		It cuts both ways - if all an article contains is anonymous sources for gossip (as opposed to whistleblowing) how can readers tell the difference between rumor and fact?
@ariehkovler @Yael_Shafritz It’s not true.
For the record, this is the second @politico article about me in a short period of time with *0* named sources to back claims containing false information.		Their articles are printed + distributed to **Congressional offices** - w/ no named sources.		It’s really unfortunate.
- Defeated a 10-term incumbent while outspent 10-1	- Travelled cross-country to build support for progressive movements where they’ve been abandoned (MI, KS) &amp; new ideas (Public Banks, Green New Deal)	- 3 IDC defeats came from NY-14	- Highest recent non-prez turnout for NY-14 https://t.co/iJF9qkoOGe
One disappointment about DC is the gossip that masquerades as “reporting.”		This story has:	- Not a SINGLE named or verifiable source	- Only ONE on-the-record comment, which is a denial.		My dad had a name for junk articles like this:	“Birdcage lining.”	 https://t.co/kIBMM2eiWb

This is the downside of the political stunt of voting against member allowance or pay increases.		Politicians can get on a high horse about declining their own pay increase, and then write nefarious loopholes to allow use of leg power to make money in potentially unethical ways.
This blows my mind: House Ethics Rules prevent me from receiving a $100 gift card, or crashing at a place as I wait for rent 💰, but somehow allow members w/ investment portfolios to write laws that will personally enrich them $1000s in their own stocks; potentially millions. https://t.co/E9L1cVubFe

If anything, the stories of our ancestry give us windows of opportunity to lean into others, to seek them out, and see ourselves, our histories, and our futures, tightly knit with other communities in a way we perhaps never before thought possible.

@JoePoutous If I’m not mistaken, this information is publicly disclosed for all members.
There’s a little wiggle room - everyone isn’t given the same exact amount, but it’s pretty close. If you’re from a district with high transportation costs, high rents (urban/suburban areas), or both, it can have the potential to pressure wages downward for similar operations.
Each member of Congress gets around $1.2 million (give or take a bit) for their entire operating budget.

When you whine about minimum wage, you whine that although businesses need to pay a min price for every other input, they somehow wish that they can pay human labor less than they require to live.

Now what I DON’T want is for our public funds to be funding freebie helipads for Amazon + robber baron billionaires, all while NYCHA and public schools go underfunded &amp; mom+pops get nowhere near that kind of a break.

It is unjust for Congress to budget a living wage for ourselves, yet rely on unpaid interns &amp; underpaid overworked staff just bc Republicans want to make a statement about “fiscal responsibility.”		If that’s the case, they can cut down on staff to pay them well. Or raise the MRA.

I was among the first to say that Lee is my ideal Speaker, because I so admire her progressive record, tenacity, and political courage.		But Rep. Lee is running for Caucus chair, and as long as she is, I will support her too.
In that same spirit and desire for new leadership, and to ensure that an ambitious, progressive, + intersectional agenda is championed at the highest levels of the party, I enthusiastically support @RepBarbaraLee to Chair the House Democratic Caucus.		https://t.co/KtvEfbPMBJ
There are many issues where the Leader and I disagree.		I was one of only 2 Dems (w/ @RoKhanna) to go on the record to call the proposed tax rule &amp; PAYGO a bad idea.		Yet, we need leadership to be more daring, not less. Her challengers are conservative.	https://t.co/eOkxvZCxPM
@ElizabethBanks @KimothyJoy Thank you! 💜💜
I hope that we can move swiftly to conclude this discussion about party positions, so that we can spend more time discussing party priorities: voting rights, healthcare, wages, climate change, housing, cannabis legalization, good jobs, etc.
I agree that our party should, and must, evolve our leadership.		But changed leadership should reflect an actual, evolved mission; namely, an increased commitment to the middle + working class electorate that put us here.		Otherwise it’s a just new figure with the same problems.
All the challenges to Leader Pelosi are coming from her right, in an apparent effort to make the party even more conservative and bent toward corporate interests.		Hard pass. So long as Leader Pelosi remains the most progressive candidate for Speaker, she can count on my support. https://t.co/yNVa8IorWY

We are working to build on the progress that’s being made.		The added teeth that these young people are demanding:	1. Committee should have power to draft legislation (select committees can, but mandate must be given)	2. No appointed members that accept fossil fuel contributions https://t.co/KG0ko5ufFx
Next, we should define the standards of that committee. To be truly effective, it should:	1. Have a mandate to draft a Green New Deal plan by 2020;	2. Not have officials appointed to it that accept fossil fuel industry contributions
Thank you, @NancyPelosi. 		We have 10 years left to plan and implement a Green New Deal before cataclysmic climate disaster.		Reinstating the Select Committee is exactly what we need to do. https://t.co/Uy5BnrLZcR
Reinstating the Select Committee is a great decision that I fully support.		These dynamic leaders want to ensure is that the committee:	- Has a mandate to draft a Green New Deal for 100% renewable energy	- No appointed members that accept funding from the fossil fuel industry

Lastly, this isn’t just about one company or one headquarters. It’s about cost of living, corps paying their fair share, etc.		It’s not about picking a fight, either. I was elected to advocate for our community’s interests - &amp; they‘ve requested, clearly, to voice their concerns.
We need to focus on good healthcare, living wages, affordable rent. Corporations that offer none of those things should be met w/ skepticism.		It’s possible to establish economic partnerships w/ real opportunities for working families, instead of a race-to-the-bottom competition.
Displacement is not community development. Investing in luxury condos is not the same thing as investing in people and families.		Shuffling working class people out of a community does not improve their quality of life.
When we talk about bringing jobs to the community, we need to dig deep:	- Has the company promised to hire in the existing community?	- What’s the quality of jobs + how many are promised? Are these jobs low-wage or high wage? Are there benefits? Can people collectively bargain?
Amazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.

@kyliia @Dromm25 Hey Lyndsay, this was referring to the specific women I met w/ last night + what they shared. No intent to harm. JH is blessed to have a champion like @Dromm25 - and there is no shortage of advocacy our trans community needs. Looking forward to echoing that allyship in Congress.
So much of my early organizing was centered on working with teens &amp; young people to fully realize their potential.		Honored to be back at it today for #WeDayUN during #UNGA week.		Next stop: Queens to speak with local women vendors! https://t.co/mQVqP569KI
@Dromm25 Absolutely - and thank you for leadership, @Dromm25. 		Apologies if it implied no one had met w/ the community at all - I was speaking about these women, many of whom didn’t speak English.		Looking forward to further tying advocacy for decrim, immigration &amp; trans rights together.
@fionaleslie @xg8300 @Dromm25 Yep! Just this group - didn’t mean to conflate the two. Apologies for any miscommunication.		Many of these women primarily speak Spanish, so to be able to converse directly in their first language helped facilitate that connection as well.

We shared pizza and soda and I listened to all their stories. Stories of employment discrimination, assault, immigration, and incarceration in male facilities.		What the GOP doesn’t care to understand is how deeply the Kavanaugh nomination is retraumatizing a nation of survivors.

@SkylarJordan Agreeing - saying that PR and Appalachia actually share quite a bit in common. Yet we don’t question Appalachia’s US status as conditional based on an assessment of its economic value. PR is treated differently because of its colonial history &amp; modern day colonial status.
It is revealing that this question:		 a) comes from quite the colonial mindset of “what value is this territory providing us anyway?” (Do we ask that about Appalachia, etc?)		b) implies that PR’s current status is somehow an act of charity - also a sentiment rooted in colonialism

Medicare for All costs $32 trillion.		Our *current* system costs more than that for less care than Medicare for All would provide.		Medicare for All aims to cover physical, dental, and mental healthcare for less money than the current setup.
Medicare for All (H.R.676) has been on the floor of Congress since 2003. The bill is 15 years old.		A stream of studies from both the left and right have shown both the funding mechanisms &amp; immense cost savings of a Medicare for All system.		Almost every modern nation has one.
It truly is outrageous how little scrutiny the rushed $2 trillion dollar GOP tax cut got from *sitting* members of Congress.		Who asked them, “What services do you plan to cut? Will the GOP be slashing Medicare or Social Security to match?”		No one answered.		And it passed. https://t.co/Z9Xe2c4S1d

@dansac @justicedems We should be kinder than this.		This is problem we have with our discourse: the idea that disagreeing with a person on one thing makes them an “enemy.” That hurts movements.		I respect @matthewstoller. Happen to disagree here. Doesn’t make him an enemy, makes him a convo partner.
Race + class are not either/or. It’s not one “or” the other, or one “more” than the other.		Ayanna often says “the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power.”		When we try to argue which mattered “more,” we miss the whole point.		We must champion it all, the best.
Our identities matter because they inform + center intersectional policy. People of all races can do that, but candidates like Ayanna and I don’t have the luxury of *not* thinking and talking about criminal justice, immigration, &amp; healthcare in ways that impact us all. /2
W/ respect, the idea that demographic turnout can be divorced from policy is so mistaken.

Remember when the GOP called the Affordable Care Act “socialist” for 8 years straight?		Well, now 70% of Americans support Medicare for All - including a majority of Republican voters 🙂		How’d that work out for you? 	🌊 🌊 🌊 https://t.co/qXgoOWCcQQ
More imperfect people need to run for office. We need to eliminate the idea of “perfect” candidates - there’s no such thing.		What matters are your values and the platform you’re fighting for.		When the opposition goes into personal nonsense, it’s because they‘re empty handed.
Why is the GOP so corny?		You can front a band and run for office. You can pierce your nose, be a bartender, a teacher, a stay at home parent; wear a dress or rip your jeans - none of this disqualifies you from advancing the fight for healthcare, education, housing, and justice. https://t.co/NuVgmJmOFE
These are all some of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, built on labor with precarious pay, damaging work conditions, and notoriously endures abuse and sexual harassment as a result.		It’s time for #OneFairWage, which is part of a larger fight for a #LivingWage for all.
When we think of tipped workers, we usually think of some restaurant workers.		But tipped workers are far more than that: they are nail salons, car wash techs, and more. https://t.co/LxbJOOJRYu
What we are seeing happen across the country - in Florida, Georgia, Michigan - is that people are rejecting the GOP’s division and fear.		The United States has always been a multilingual, diverse nation that fights for a more perfect union, towards freedom and justice for all.
When we learn to champion our neighbors, we win elections.		We won our primary with 57% of the vote. That happens when we reject zero-sum thinking and come together without silencing each other’s needs.

I will do so in Congress, and I’m proud of visionary women like @audreygelman and those @the_wing who know that when workplaces are humane places, we ALL benefit.
@audreygelman @the_wing Changes like these are extraordinarily impactful, and the lives of many will be transformed by this shift.		Women and parents especially stand to benefit from improvements to part-time work conditions, whose flexibility is critical for caretaking and growing other skills.

I support @SenWarren &amp; @SenSanders‘ Marshall Plan for Puerto Rico.		We must also talk about the cancellation of PR’s debt, much of which is suspected to be illegal; and the imposition of PROMESA.		Puerto Ricans also deserve the right to self-determination.
The subjugation and treatment of Puerto Ricans as 2nd-class citizens of the United States is nothing new.		It’s codified into law. It’s codified in status.		And recognition of this gross injustice is bipartisan: @SenJohnMcCain has introduced legislation to lift the Jones Act. /3
It is estimated that almost 5,000 Puerto Ricans have died in the wake of Hurricane María.		The Federal government maintains that the official death count from the storm was 64.		The island has yet to undergo a major recovery effort. Homes are still covered in tarps. /2
120 years ago today (July 25th, 1898) Puerto Rico was invaded and made a colony of the United States.		Puerto Ricans are US citizens. But they STILL don’t have the right to vote federally, nor do have voting rep in Congress (unless they move). Nor are they a sovereign people.

Raising the Federal minimum wage to a living wage, and supporting a revitalized, 21st century labor movement are two essential starting points for working class Americans getting the dignified pay they deserve.		Healthcare, education, and housing are key cornerstones, too.
The big economic 🐘 in the room: Real wages in the US have not risen in decades.		Meanwhile, costs of living (rent, healthcare) + education have soared.		Working people aren’t experiencing the prosperous growth touted on TV: that’s going to a small few.	https://t.co/e2GlIdiwnt
Ask your next Uber/hail service driver what their life is like.		Many are teachers, or work retail, or have another job.		Unemployment isn’t the major problem for those folks. 		It’s that, on one wage at 40 hours a week, they aren’t paid enough to live.
Unsure why you leap to interpret my comments in the dimmest light possible - almost as though you have an agenda🤔		CLEARLY, unemployment is unchanged by the # of jobs each person has.		But low unemployment doesn’t tell the full story. Wages are low, driving ppl to 2nd jobs+gigs. https://t.co/z1QD034TVI

When I talk about @CoriBush, @ZephyrTeachout, @LinseyFaganTX &amp; other incredible candidates, it’s because I know them. I have met them. They are knockout leaders. And they helped me when I wasn’t “viable” either.		We must have the courage to MAKE viability, not WAIT for viability.
There’s a vicious cycle between lack of perceived “viability” and willingness to support.		If you’re not willing to support a candidate with time or a few dollars, then that candidate isn’t “viable.” But too often, we wait for a candidate to be “viable” before we do those things.
For my entire race, I wasn’t “viable” enough for any established groups or people.		I had all the numbers. We shared the “perfect storm” factors. And we had already knocked on tens of thousands of doors *by JANUARY.*		We need to look at more than just $ to determine viability.
There’s a secret little word used to dismiss political candidates: “viability.”		I want these women to at least have a shot, to be seen as legitimate - because they are.		Ultimately, what makes a candidate viable is our individual choice to believe in them.https://t.co/ifkK4NYIyK

That opened up a totally different conversation.		Gracias, @jorgeramosnews! https://t.co/2kkZ7lkDWW

Our win in New York is due to the hundreds (and thousands) of everyday people-turned-organizers who believed a better world was possible, were willing to learn, and picked up a phone or knocked a door.		It’s Ocasio2018 supporters who got this done. You can get it done, too. https://t.co/SYEzmNWaSa

Slave abolitionists were radical.	Suffragettes were radical.	Civil Rights organizers were radical.	Labor organizers + the 40-hour workweek were radical once, too.

Our entire democracy is healthier when we increase voter turnout. We come to better collective decisions when more of us have a say.		That starts with:	- Election Day as a Federal Holiday	- Automatic Voter Registration / Same-Day Registration	- Mail-In Ballots
In 2016, New York had the second lowest primary turnout in the COUNTRY.		There are very simple and easy changes we could make to increase voter turnout - some barely cost a dime and others even save money (i.e. having ONE primary election for races instead of multiple dates).
Welcome to New York, one of the worst offenders in voter suppression!		Many incumbents rely on LOW voter turnout here to keep their jobs.		Year after year, they allow no mail-in ballots, no early voting, obscure registration deadlines, multiple primary elections per year... https://t.co/9c5RHhSfyI

@ShaunKing Thank you for understanding that this win is all due to organizing and the message.
This is the start of a movement.		Thank you all.
We triggered the first primary election in 14 years. OUR supporters, collecting signatures in the bitter snow for 5 weeks, did that.		No matter who the vote is for, every single vote cast to day is ours - because we made this election happen.
But I knew that in refusing to engage with non-voters, we were churning a cycle of neglect and cynicism.		So I reached out. And we have been embraced. We have built power. We have organized.		What we have built is permanent. No. Matter. What.
Today I saw people voting that are almost never seen in an off-year midterm primary.		Just now, as I’m typing this with 8 minutes left, two young men of color, 20 years old, just walked up to me and said they just voted.		2 yrs ago, the “experts” told me not to bother with them.
I have spent today criss-crossing the district my family has called home for generations. I have met strangers who knew my dad, and knew stories about my loved ones.		I have touched the hands of people who have felt ignored and invisible for a long, long time. And they felt seen.
Almost two years ago, I started what was then a completely ‘impossible’ bid for Congress.		Since then, everything has changed.		Now, there’s only 20 minutes left.		And it feels great.

I say this with hopes that some may  include in their perspective on immigration the long history and context of migration in the Americas.		It’s a bit rambling, but I think all the time about how those kids + their families were from All. Over. The place. Because it’s normal.
We conveniently forget that large, massive swaths of the United States used to be Mexico.		Latinx people are baked into the land of the Americas and the United States. 		We are a product of indigenous peoples, who have been displaced and fleeing violence for most modern history.
Many of the young people I worked with came from El Paso and other border cities like McAllen and Laredo.		I remember their stories of home: making shopping trips across the US-MEX border to get treats and head back before dinner.		The border was a casual fact of life. /2
As an Educational Director w/ @nhi_news, I worked with 1000s of kids of all statuses: US citizens, residents, DREAMers, undocumented youth.		They came to us from fruit farms and street blocks.

My opponent has already spent $3 million dollars, and raised more 💰 from GOP lobbyists this week.		Yet our field conversions are through the roof. We can win this, but ONLY if people (+ organizers) come this weekend.		People don’t know there’s an election: 3% turnout district. https://t.co/M2czII8BwI
When I started this race, I pretty much did everything they told you not to do: I engaged non-primary voters, young people, poc, people w/o college degree. 		Because that’s what organizers do.		I refuse to accept that 97% of New Yorkers are “non-voters.” We are changing that NOW.
An ORGANIZED electorate is far more powerful, because a purchased electorate does not engage.		ORGANIZED electorates win midterms and build power. Purchased electorates remain expensive and don’t push for change in the off-season.
What we desperately need right now are fierce advocates for economic, social, and racial justice.		Experienced new candidates that present new ideas - Abolish ICE, a Fed Jobs Guarantee - to influence National discourse and ORGANIZE the electorate, not BUY the electorate.
Red to Blue is critically important. But many Red to Blue Dems will always have pressure to be moderate so they can keep their seats.		Safe Blue Dems should be charting the most ambitious visions and ideas for future.		Instead, they are raking in Republican lobbyist cash.
Incumbent Democrats voted to create ICE.		Incumbent Democrats voted to gut Dodd-Frank before passing.		Incumbent Democrats voted to lower the Federal minimum wage in Puerto Rico to $4.25/hour.		We need to change the Democratic Party because that is what we CAN change.
We cannot afford to stay the course and elect the same exact leadership over + over.		People ask me, “How do you plan to change the party?”		Can’t be me. WE have to ELECT a new Democratic Party - one that fights doggedly for working class Americans and stands for the vulnerable.
We need to talk about the future of the Democratic Party.		We are at a crisis point in our country.		If we continue to vote for the same leadership &amp; tactics that lost us 1,000 seats, the House, the Senate, AND the Presidency, we will continue to be a nation in decline.

@tomwatson @NatalieElsberg Census doesn’t include/Hispanic when they ask race, so Latinx people largely check “white,” also “native” and “black.”		This is demographics 101. Also a reason why looking up stats without stepping into a community doesn’t give the full picture. Community has also changed a LOT.
@tomwatson When we say “there’s no point” in bringing in natl figures, then communities like ours say “what’s the point” to mobilizing.		Attitudes like this, saying certain communities aren’t worth national attention bc the “strategy” doesn’t add up is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
@tomwatson The goal is for communities in the BX &amp; Queens to actually be seen, valued, and invited to mobilize in 2020 instead of being ignored, dismissed, and taken for granted by the national party.		Asking “what’s the point” in caring about the Bronx, Queens, etc is the problem. /1
And listen - campaigns need funds to operate. That’s just a fact. We need resources to print literature, get an office, have organizers, etc.		But you don’t need to get it from corporations. It’s HARD to organize clean + ethical funding. But it’s worth it &amp; much more powerful.
This is an excellent point about corporate Dem refusal to reject Corp lobbyist money. In taking this stance, you’re following the GOP’s lead.		That’s the opposite of leadership.

@reyeslv @pachiche1 I think it’s perfectly fine to name a public work after a former governor.		But why take a name away to do it? Why not name something else after Mario Cuomo?
@reyeslv @pachiche1 Think about the furor over taking down confederate statues. Even in NY there is controversy over taking down the Columbus statue.		The argument is about not “erasing history.”		Now think about how no one seems to mind when public works honoring NY indigenous people are erased.
Chris Cuomo, CNN anchor, saying the Cuomos aren’t a political dynasty bc “only 2” in his family have been governor is really something.		His brother, Andrew Cuomo, just renamed a major bridge after his dad.		It used to be Tappan Zee, named after indigenous people who lived there. https://t.co/pBzU0w4nuo

@JarekFA @BrooklynPortage @Naparstek @StreetsblogNYC Hey @JarekaFA,		I don’t own a car. I‘m from the Bronx. Here bikes are far too dangerous. Even most delivery folks don’t have them. Underserved communities like ours are usually the last to get investments. I need you to work with me,instead of judge me, if we’re going to improve.
Alright y’all. Obviously this is a heated issue. And I don’t even own a car.		Perhaps we do a sit down at my office on federal transportation policy.		Open to all &amp; I’m more than willing to learn and grow. That’s the benefit of not taking special interest funds.
RT @saieedkhalil: @HuffPostPol I'm so excited to be writing postcards for @Ocasio2018 !
@radlerkoenigin Come to our office and let’s talk about it! Transportation is a highly intersectional issue and I’d love to see how we translate transport justice to a federal level.
@ohhleary My apologies for stating this in boiled down 280 chars - basically local folks are pinched because out of community cars are parking locally.		Increasing doesn’t have to mean build. But I’m happy to sit with TA &amp; other groups to shape that message meaningfully
Something we can all agree on ⬇️ https://t.co/tQsBLrTGZK
@macartney Okay okay! Let’s sit down! Willing to learn and grow from activists  :)
@acharya_dude I’m definitely open to hearing this side of this issue - all in all NYC works better with less cars on the road. I try to think of this from a “short-term needs to long-term goals” perspective.		Also make sure this is getting to your city councilmember, who makes these decisions!
This isn’t even going into the fact that the city stopped planning for new public infrastructure decades ago.		We also need to plan for big ideas like more outer-borough public transit (Bronx to Queens, anyone?) to reduce the number of cars we need in the first place.
1080 parking spots! Demolished w/o replacement! This is what I’m talking about.		Real estate devs don’t like garages because they can make more $ otherwise. But if they bring people in, they should realize we need to accommodate them with more schools, sewage plants, and PARKING. https://t.co/JxpUQXX75p
@_paul_pablo_ @macartney I do! 💜
@macartney @MakeQueensSafer I’d love that!
@macartney @MakeQueensSafer Yes, apologies if that was unclear - the bike lanes have a very clear + serious why. 		I had meant addressing why local drivers are so worked up over it. At the core, I think they want a safe neighborhood too - we can increase parking elsewhere to accommodate for the bike lane.
Some of the ideas/issues I’ve heard from local Woodside+Sunnyside residents:		- Residential parking on side streets	- Uber drivers from BK &amp; outer Queens are leaving their cars in Woodside for days/week+ at a time. They don’t live there + take spaces from locals	- Municipal lots!
Because these developers don’t seem to support expanded municipal parking (like some of the ones found in Astoria), it causes the community to fight over scraps.		We can make moves that increase local parking while still having safe bike lanes. /4
Basically, real estate developers are buying off rezonings from elected officials via campaign finance.		This causes new buildings to bring in 100s/1000s more people into a neighborhood without making *any* public investments.		Schools, sewage, &amp; yes, parking all get strained. /3
I think a bike lane is a good idea. We’ve had far too many tragedies in the area (@MakeQueensSafer has been doing good work here too).		People have intense, daily frustration w/ far less access to parking than they had before. But we also need to address WHY this is happening. /2
Oh man, this Skillman Bike lane issue is HEATED. I went to the town hall for it and it was packed to the max.		I’ve sat with activists and small business owners on this issue.		Here are my initial thoughts - this issue is STRONGLY connected to role of real estate devs in NYC. /1 https://t.co/A2jpezayzQ
NYC: check your polling location early &amp; often.		You can find your polling place here: https://t.co/lt9pjNp3hY		But LEAVE ROOM FOR ERROR on Election Day! NYC pollsites often open late, have broken machines, or send you to other locations.		Schedule yourself time to vote. https://t.co/DgJD0htQiM

In order for our system to get better, we MUST pursue policies like #MedicareForAll - which is the only real plan on the table that will extend mental healthcare to all Americans. (Dental, too!)		We must also be unafraid to discuss topics like slavery, mass incarceration &amp; race.
This is also why @repjoecrowley’s most recent support for a stronger police enforcement bill is so hurtful + wrong.		Our district includes RIKERS ISLAND. Increasing criminalization is NOT how we get safer.		We must focus healthcare, education, re-entry + jobs for our communities.
Police came in, guns drawn, for a mental wellness check on a well-known figure.		Our policing and incarceration system is NOT resourced nor designed for mental healthcare.
