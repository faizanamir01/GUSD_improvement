I am committed to working with @KimReynoldsIA to ensure that the sanctity of life is valued and protected here in Iowa. I refuse to let the state we know and love become the next New York or Virginia or Vermont. https://t.co/2PUnXjc2wd
National Democrats want to provide economic security for those who are "unwilling to work." Here in Iowa, we know the value of hard work, and don't expect—or want—handouts from anyone. Share your thoughts on this issue in my survey&gt;&gt;&gt;	https://t.co/GAviggux3K https://t.co/GNYYG2Xmhp

I’m determined to keep your hard earned money from being wasted on ridiculous and expensive government projects. We must hold our leaders accountable for the high price tags they put on taxpayer funded projects. https://t.co/DRtszOXdTW
Democrats must be held accountable. From increasing taxes up to 70% to banning air travel to regulating the emissions of livestock, the American people deserve to know where elected officials stand on this impractical proposal. 	https://t.co/HW4EqpZgQu

It’s disheartening to think that some believe that babies with an extra chromosome do not deserve the same chance at life as anyone else. All human life is precious, and we should be celebrating those with differences, not looking to take that life away.	https://t.co/7s3fU3garN

"Folks, We Can't Just Abandon Our Pledge To Repeal And Replace Obamacare" https://t.co/cfft26X7Sh #iapolitics
I won’t stop until we repeal ObamaCare and find affordable, patient-centered healthcare solutions for all Americans. You have my word.
My commitment to you remains the same, however. We MUST continue to work for those who have been negatively impacted by ObamaCare.
And to say I’m disappointed that my colleagues in the Senate chose this unsustainable status quo would be an understatement.
Unfortunately, all three of those votes failed.
Over the last few days, I’ve voted three times to repeal ObamaCare, just like I promised you.
We can’t give up.
In the days ahead, as the Senate moves forward and considers various options, I will continue to make your voice heard in Washington.
That’s why I voted to begin debate on repealing this disastrous law and replacing it with solutions that are patient-centered.
For far too long, I’ve heard from folks about the struggles everyday Americans face under ObamaCare.
Wishing my friend, and American hero, John McCain the very best. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.
Happy to be on board! https://t.co/7Ig6w4BoTA

I’m looking forward to joining other conservatives at @CPAC as we rally toward the 2016 election.  Join me this March at National Harbor!
The House just passed my bill to stop the Obama Administration’s latest land-grab – the EPA’s expanded Waters of the U.S. Rule.
We need a leader to get America growing again, develop plans to destroy ISIS &amp; ensure we remain a strong, stabilizing force around the globe
In 2016 we need to elect a strong conservative leader to the White House.
Last night's #SOTU was another campaign speech long on rhetoric and short on real solutions.
Today I voted in support of a bi-partisan initiative to audit the Federal Reserve because Iowans deserve transparency.
So excited to have another outstanding conservative woman in a position of leadership in Iowa. Congrats @SpeakerUpmeyer!

What does $57K mean to you? College tuition? Groceries for your family? Instead it’s your share of nat’l debt. https://t.co/J7S7kfp7i6

We need a Republican in the White House to make sure the Keystone Pipeline becomes a reality.
Keystone had bipartisan support in the Sen. Disappointed w/ Pres Obama's standing w/ extreme enviromentalists over majority of Americans.

Not good policy RT @StewSays: POTUS calls for a tax hike on energy producers. #SOTU
We need real, proven solutions,such as tax cuts,that put more money directly back into the hands of our families &amp; lead to more jobs. #SOTU
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are still nearly 1.2M fewer jobs today than 6 yrs ago. #SOTU #iasen
Gov't is over $17 trillion in debt, more than $6 trillion added during POTUS 5 yrs  in office. We need a smaller, more efficient govt #SOTU
