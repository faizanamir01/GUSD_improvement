@angee_saucier @CNN We can find a cell phone just by a number but they can't find this guy? I'm sure by now they know the VIN number of the car

@TWC_Help a representative did that last night and it didn't work and that's when she told us she would call us back, and never did
@TWC_Help I understand that, but maybe this will help, the representative we spoke to last night asked for our digital box #, CTBDNFTBR
@TWC_Help I understand issues occur but 2 of TWC representatives ASSURED us yesterday the issue would be resolved, it hasn't been
@TWC_Help unfortunately they don't return until tomorrow at 11am and there was a TWC business representative here yesterday
@TWC_Help We have yet to get the return call
@TWC_Help yes the hotel Mgr has called and we called the 1-877-636-3278 @ 704 pm last night and were told by the rep she would call us back
@TWC_Help I don't have any of that information, we are staying at a hotel that has time warner cable as it's supplier
