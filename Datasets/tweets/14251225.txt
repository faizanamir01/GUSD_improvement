@joeatonlv1 The dogs are Phife and DZA; the second question is too ludicrous to answer.

Yeah @mmckinnon has an exchange with Jordan that I think you will enjoy. https://t.co/3atTEbrnpB
No need to apologize for being a purist, but you might want to apologize for thinking you know my dog's name and I don't. It's Phife Dog. (Also it wld be quite something if Phife Dawg was making a cameo on tonight's @SHO_TheCircus, since Malik unf passed away nearly 3 years ago.) https://t.co/8hzOO4t91X

@Anime_Now90 @Lastwaltz2 @SHO_TheCircus @realDonaldTrump @MichaelCohen212 @JackieSpeier @mattgaetz @RepCummings @MarkMeadows @AdamSchiff @JimJordan @CPAC @emilyjanefox Because The Wire was a fictional s scripted series and we are a news-documentaryv series coping with a warp-speed changing political reality, and doing an hour would (a) make for less propulsive storytelling and (b) kill us all.

#boom https://t.co/8HMK2FooXd
Did @MarkMeadows just attempt to repudiate the notion that Donald Trump is a racist by identifying a lone African-American who doesn't think it's true?
It's early going but at least one thing is clear at this point: Michael Cohen came to play.
Or, to rephrase: Democrats have invited someone to testify to Congress who WORKED FOR TRUMP FOR A DECADE AND is literally going to jail, in part, for lying to Congress under oath ON TRUMP'S BEHALF. https://t.co/LMFMeMgbyx
@MichaelCohen212 came to play.
Yeah it's the media giving Cohen credibility -- and not @realDonaldTrump who employed him as his main fixer for a decade. https://t.co/DCSh3UOIgV

@Wyatt_Earth @SHO_TheCircus @mmckinnon @alexwagner An ignoramus with 46 followers using "lmaoooooooo" "triggered" and "lolololol" in the same tweet? Almost as decisive as "fake news", which is I'm sure where you're headed next, so ... #ByeFelicia.

I'm all in on Flynn on @TheLastWord with @Lawrence -- for the full hour -- at 10pm ET.
@dcherring @MrFelt_ @RadioFreeTom @Morning_Joe Not sure @RadioFreeTom is the guy to administer such a test.
@QCwordlady The blue is Phife, the merle pup is DZA, and I was saying goodbye not coming home, but the sentiment is the same -- and yes!

I'm not great at making deadlines, but if it's Friday, I'm definitely making @DeadlineWH (and not even @NicolleDWallace can stop me).
This is a respectable set of picks -- though the Kraftwerk nerds (I'm not one) are gonna hate you forever, and there's no sane list (including mine) that doesn't have @llcoolj on it. Cc @briankoppelman https://t.co/nyCZwo7RWD

Attached is my blank ballot for this year's @rockhall class. Voters are allowed 5 choices and no write-ins (so "Write in Warren Zevon" is a fine sentiment but not a useful one). Cc'ing @briankoppelman cuz he loves these games and is my go-to Twitter 🎵🤓. Ready, set, go!!! 2/2 https://t.co/MtwxKABCnM
So @RadioFreeTom, having helped spark and embroil you in the great Boston v Led Zep debate of 2018 (which, even for those of us who don't love Zep and don't mind Boston, is really no debate at all), let me light another Twitter 🎶🔥 -- assuming you're not too singed to play. 1/2
Longtime friend and fan of @alexheard but this is akin to complaining that @JoeNBC and I failed to enumerate the reasons why the Yankees a better ballclub historically than the Padres. https://t.co/QofH6meh5T
Those three states aren't THE key states, but they are among the key states in any presidential election, and the fact that Dems just won statewide in all of them -- after two (WI MI) being governed by Rs the previous 8 years -- is a big deal. https://t.co/zjB0fDLaPM

Grotesque. Disgusting. Shameful. https://t.co/rS3Z7GSTos
Bottom line: @SenatorHeitkamp argues @kevincramer will be a rubber stamp for @realDonaldTrump and @senatemajldr. Cramer basically says: yup, and that's better for ND.
The extent to which the Kavanaugh confirmation battle altered the midterm political terrain is vividly on display in #NDSenDebate. Multiple Qs, and on each one, @kevincramer clearly believes he is playing the winning hand.
Not clear from this exchange that Cramer knows the difference between those two words. https://t.co/zov4fwihy3
@kevincramer says the Kavanaugh hearings showed the world what "mob rule" looked like. Hard to figure, tho, how the "mob" "ruled" when Kavanaugh got confirmed. 🤔 #NDSenDebate

A question that's been nagging at me for the past 3 weeks, and seems even more intriguing now: What has John Roberts been thinking -- and maybe doing, behind the scenes -- about the Kavanaugh spectacle?
@SanjuktaMPaul @SenatorCollins @senatemajldr @Sen_JoeManchin You're not bothering me at all -- and I was just genuinely asking what in my tweet led you to think I was jumping to a conclusion about how Collins would vote. (I've been saying for the past two weeks I thought she was likely a Yes.)

@SanjuktaMPaul @SenatorCollins @senatemajldr @Sen_JoeManchin Did I say I thought she was a No?
If @SenatorCollins is a No, watch as @senatemajldr swiftly tries to induce @Sen_JoeManchin to switch parties -- with a promise that his current opponent will withdraw and that as a Republican Manchin will be safely elected to any WVa gig he wants in perpetuity.
As we come down to the wire on #KavanaughConfirmation, the only Dem Senator still undecided is @JoeManchinWV. In another preview of this Sunday's new episode of @SHO_TheCircus, Manchin talks to @mmckinnon. https://t.co/m2qEVpQZm8

Between @realDonaldTrump last night, @KellyannePolls this morning, and now @PressSec, it's clear a new @WhiteHouse strategy is in effect: Dr Blasey Ford is no longer credible but mistaken -- she's now a target for skepticism, criticism, and (in DJT's case) mockery.

A truly remarkable development that will likely have zero impact on what is about to unfold. https://t.co/vmRq13uBuq
The contrast between Fox News interview Kavanaugh and Ford hearing Kavanaugh is quite jarring.
@SenatorDurbin was very strong on the question of an FBI investigation. Kavanaugh's replies were, well, not.
I'll ask again: Why would a man this indignant, emotional, and certain of his innocence not be demanding an FBI investigation of the accusations against him? Why is he not insisting that his friend Mark Judge testify on his behalf?
Product placement. Cc @SHO_TheCircus https://t.co/ZtJxikfKRb

@soledadobrien @larry_author @LindseyGrahamSC I'll take it.
My God what a flailing gibberish-spouting mess @LindseyGrahamSC has become.
Not a single GOP Senator who wasn't already a hard Yes is a single millimeter closer to being one now -- and it's difficult to imagine what Kavanaugh could possibly say to move the needle for them at this point.
@franklinleonard Omg so interested -- and so looking forward to the long-form profile in which she eventually, inevitably cooperates.
I believe she just openly eviscerated the structure of the hearing devised by the men who hired her -- or did I mishear her??? https://t.co/KyXSE449HL

Both of these points are obviously correct -- and/but have been obvs true long before this. https://t.co/AwnhHe47sw

Cc @theblatt https://t.co/dM6xiBjhf9
@hookembuzz @mindy965 My reply was to Mindy. You might wanna learn how to use Twitter. And you lived it how? Did you know Kennedy or Bork? And the way you toss around "murderer" suggests you also might wanna consult a dictionary -- though that won't cure wing-nuttery, which seems to be your malady.
And no one knows that better than @theblatt. https://t.co/8fNjHQz5oN
It's Bork and yes he did -- he was Solicitor General and capitulated to RMN's demand to fire special counsel Archibald Cox after AG Elliot Richardson and Dep AG William Ruckelshaus refused and resigned in protest. https://t.co/Orq1UYDE7d
@mindy965 @hookembuzz You might consider Googling.
Accurate. https://t.co/YWKUvO0e1C
@NonDemNonRepub @marieproia It makes perfect sense if you know how to use Twitter -- which is the platform you're using.
What McConnell did to Garland was shameful, appalling, profoundly cynical, and utterly free of principle. But Dems can't stop Trump's pick with a process argument. Has to be about bigger things, and abortion and health care are a good place to start (but not end). https://t.co/APfjbo8yNj
To be even clearer: no sane person considers this anything but utterly baseless, fantastical bullshit. https://t.co/ZIms21rq09
Except in a presidential debate and a speech via satellite to anti-abortion activists last year -- in both of which he made his (current) views on Roe and SCOTUS abundantly clear. https://t.co/SEtBljU4hD

@kickonct @walztv @Jhelum Not sure who @jhelum is, but for the record: not supporting anti-Semitism (or Roseanne) by saying an ep of her show was good. Also not Republican or a believer in Catholicism. FWIW, attacks are much more effective if at least vaguely tethered to reality. And now, #ByeFelicia.

@tomselliott Not saying it's sinister at all. Saying one of his main roles in the party now is catering to its donor class, which doesn't care abt the size of government as long as corp taxes are low and corp profits high -- and desperately fears a trade war and its consquences in the market.
#onit https://t.co/umyWBU1tTU
@tomselliott The Paul Ryan of Empower America days wasn't Speaker of the House or the biggest fundraising draw in the Republican Party. The idea that donor maintenance and "pragmatism" are unrelated is a little naive. (Also, curious, have you ever actually spoken to Paul Ryan?)
You think *you're* fatigued??? https://t.co/GNQoha1BKF
@tomselliott You obviously haven't been listening to Paul Ryan for, oh, the last 20 years.
