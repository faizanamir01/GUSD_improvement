@Olivianuzzi 😘
@draiochta14 thank you -- i don't plan on changing that.  I am more interested in working on the "judgy" part that comes out mostly on Twitter and my columns, but can seep into commentary from time to time
@ealison TY but i know i can do better than what i've done, esp here on Twitter.  There is a way to stand up for what you believe without rushing to judgment ... and that includes even after all the facts are in. there is something to be said for taking time to think about an issue...
@LeiaRx There is a way to hold people accountable and not be judgmental. Also i really do believe people are not the sum of their worst moments in life and too often in the media we make it seem like they are.
yes that's the challenge ... but if I can't figure out a way to do this in a way that is consistent with who I want to be then I'll have to find another career.... https://t.co/D7g4fAmDWg
@Bouje99 exactly! i've worked so hard to not be a hypocrite but then became someone sitting in judgement in every situation to try and stay consistent....just as bad.
8)  I also hope to be part of a conversation -- if we ever have it as a country -- about the path to redemption for people who have stumbled and even failed spectacularly.  This is where I plan to put my focus and not on rendering judgements about other people's behavior. THE END
7) I often am too rigid in trying to be pure in my principles and don't leave enough room for this mess of life.  So I'm writing this as an apology to both left and right and making a pledge to do better.
6) It should be said I have been an equal opportunity scold, and liberals have been on the receiving end of my judgement and I regret that as well. I am rethinking my view on Al Franken, for example, after hearing from many friends on the issue of the rush to judgement.
5) I also don't believe these teenagers should be tarnished forever for what amounts to one really bad day. I know that black teenage boys don't get this benefit of the doubt or grace, but I want more black teenage boys to get this benefit, not fewer white teenage boys.
4)  Yes, this applies in the Covington case. This will please nobody because I still believe the teenagers were disrespectful, but my tweets were lacking in grace. As a Catholic I felt duty bound to speak up and hold them accountable, but that really isn't my job.
3) I want to stand on the side of justice and equality but also of grace and I have failed to do that. Part of grace is recognizing my own fallibilities and imperfect judgment and reminding myself that there but for the grace of God go I.
2) I work hard to see	every side of an issue and also speak up when I see a wrong.  But in	doing that I am too often judgmental and condemning--both on and off social media--in a way that is	contrary to my belief system and my faith.
1) I have spent the last few weeks in a mostly Twitter free zone to spend time reflecting on what role I may have played in what indisputably has become a dangerously toxic culture.  I am not proud of what I have found.

@JillFilipovic Two things—1. SCOTUS unanimously struck down that law, meaning the liberals saw it as a problem. 2. USCCB is conservative. I don’t agree w everything they do...If there’s a way to do a constitutional buffer zone and then I would totally support it
@JillFilipovic @chrisjollyhale @JamesMartinSJ 2/2 tho in the end she has a right to not like the Catholic Church...half the time i don't either.
@JillFilipovic @chrisjollyhale @JamesMartinSJ 1/2 Chris i don't think it's fair to expect her to be an expert. She's right that there are some basic things that are obvious (such as barring women from leadership).  I actually think it's incumbent on non-conservative catholics to try and explain the Church....
@JillFilipovic ok i've got to get off twitter!
@JillFilipovic I hear everything you say (it's like you were listening in on my spiritual direction session yesterday with @JamesMartinSJ lol).  I just don't' want you to buy into the conservative line about what the Bible says. That's all that gets attention in the media even tho it's so wrong
@JillFilipovic yes the institution is deeply flawed and it's flawed b/c of human (male imo) behavior. I agree the Bishops should speak up about this issue and misogyny in particular and i've told them that.
@elainelayabout @marcdennis delete what? i never named the boy.
@JillFilipovic "actual' not "actually"
@JillFilipovic 2/ and not succumb to the idea that they have it right b/c what they have is flawed and it's flawed in large part b/c it's an all male institution that has been too committed to protecting the institution and male power
@JillFilipovic 1/Well they are upheld by some people...but there are other people who are standing against that. You won't get any disagreement from me about the problem of the patriarchy esp in the Church.  The best way to do that is by holding them to the actually teaching of Jesus ....
@JillFilipovic also -- it's really hard to understand Catholic teaching if you only pay attention to the people in the political sphere who have weaponized it to support their views. it's much more nuanced and there is a constant push and pull btwn different views in the church.
@JillFilipovic I'm not really following your point..is it that if you go to a Catholic School that is anti-abortion rights that you will act in a racist way toward an elder?  Also many faithful Catholics (incl me) don't support overturning Roe v Wade.
@JillFilipovic Actually there is nothing in the Catholic teaching that says you should harass women at abortion clinics. You are basically buying what a subsection of conservatives claim Catholicism teaches instead of what it actually teaches.

5/5 "A Rockefeller Foundation study found that when a company is in crisis, 80 percent of news reports will blame a female CEO — but if the CEO is a man, only a minority of news reports will blame him."  via @joannelipman in @usatoday 		Go read the whole column now!
4) @joannelipman also points out that women are more likely to get the job when a company is in crisis (which CBS is) making success more difficult, and studies show that the media is harder on women CEO's than male when they fail. (So keep your eyes out for this in coverage!)
3)  In the US, "more than 70% of Sunday morning politics/policy talk show guests are male. One study of English-language news sites...found that 77 percent of those mentioned in articles are men...women are “routinely marginalized or ‘symbolically annihilated’ in the news.”
2) "Zirinsky, the first woman ever to head up CBS News, is 66 years old. She has been working at the network for 46 years — which means she started a year before the executive she’s replacing, David Rhodes, was born."		Hiding in plain sight, apparently.

My point about the collective shrug when Trump said motherf++cker and the freak out when @RashidaTlaib said it isn't that we should have freaked out when Trump said it.  It's that profanity is literally the least of the problems this country faces.
Can someone please make #bothsidesism go away. https://t.co/ZN2IWlzQWX
4/4 actually one more -- my ultimate point is that the media in covering this needs to not act like it's just a mystery that @RashidaTlaib is being dragged but everyone shrugs when it's Trump.  Don't participate in dragging her for something Trump gets a pass on.
3/3 Also let's let's not take complaints from the religious right about @RashidaTlaib seriously when they could care less about DJT using the exact same word she used (and more).
2/ Where were the shrieking headlines when Trump said the same word she used? We need to be clear that there is a major double standard here: white man can curse but if a woman, esp a brown one, esp a Muslim one does it....she will be punished...
1/Respectfully disagree w/my colleague @CillizzaCNN. He says, "People don't hold Trump to the same standards that they hold other politicians to."

I am and I’ve said that in various interviews and here on Twitter. That doesn’t get posted though does it? https://t.co/h0FVftWGYD
The piece you wrote is exactly right.  Someone clips something you said, gives it a headline that distorts the actual conversation and then you are threatened and attacked (for me it’s w misogynistic rants) for weeks. 		And most ppl only read the headline. https://t.co/DYyQ1KYJ4P
Also sorry for the typos—A reminder to never write tweets without my glasses LOL
5/5 I don’t see the point in doing what I do for a living if I’m not going to say hard things or try to start hard conversations. I’m not going to do it perfectly and I wont always choose my words perfectly but my intentions are always to raise awareness of issues, not attack ppl
4). I’m sure there’s plenty of people who would’ve been angry that I was even talking about the fact that racism is an issue but I doubt I would’ve gotten the relentless attacks if Real Clear Politics hadn’t acted so irresponsibility, esp w the click bait headline
3) If they had posted the entire interview you would’ve seen that I was trying to have a hard conversation about racism and I said quite clearly that all people – – including liberals — need to contend with their own racism and privilege.
2) posting click-bait to rile up Trump supporters like Real Clear Politics did resulted in two weeks of nonstop attacks just like the one I posted.  That wasn’t an outlier.  Right wing outlets like @FoxNews and @BrietbartNews picked it up and used it to feed the outrage machine
1) one of the reasons I posted that message was to show what happens when @RealClearNews posts an video of me discussing racism and edits out the part abt me saying that all white ppl need to face up to their racism to make it seem like I only discussed Trump supporters.
I just deleted the tweet from the woman calling me “cuntbag” etc  and attacking my dogs b/c I didn’t realize when I posted the screenshot her name showed up.		She is getting attacked and no matter how horrible that message was I have no interest in causing her any harm.
