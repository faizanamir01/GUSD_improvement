What a remarkable job of Coach Monken to turn the Army program around and now has two consecutive 10 win seasons. #ArmyNavy
Final Score: Army 17 Navy 10. Three straight wins by Army as they retain the Commander-in-Chief trophy. #ArmyNavy
Don’t turn off the game yet. Onside kick time after a 45 yard FG by PK Moehring. #ArmyNavy
Army up 17-7 late, major Vegas implications on this drive. #ArmyNavy
Touchdown Army! That should do it. Navy’s defense has been so good all day but just couldn’t hold off Army at the end.
Kelvin Hopkins moves it to the Navy 2 yard line. #ArmyNavy
Navy has turned it over 3 times and is still only one score away. #ArmyNavy
Army ball with 3:02 left but Navy still has 2 timeouts. This game is not over. #ArmyNavy
Strip Sack Army!!
Army has gone surprisingly conservative in the second half. Navy with another big time stop as Taylor Heflin takes down Army’s Kelvin Hopkins for a 5 yard loss. #ArmyNavy
10-7 Army. 7:10 left in the game. Just when you thought Army was going to open it up, Navy’s defense comes through and the quarterback change has sparked the offense. #ArmyNavy

Navy’s back up QB Garrett Lewis delivers a strike down field but it is dropped. Big 3rd and possible 4th down coming up. #ArmyNavy
What a big time 4th down stop by Navy! The Defense has kept them in the game all afternoon. Navy must get points here as they change quarterbacks. #ArmyNavy
In last year's game Army-Navy game, Navy's Malcolm Perry had 30 carries for 250 yards and a touchdown. This year? Perry has carried 3 times for just 4 yards. #ArmyNavy
Army leads 10-0 as we head to the 4th quarter. 4th and 2 from the Navy 43 yard line. Navy needs a big play here to stay in the game. #ArmyNavy
Navy had registered its first third down conversion of the game on that drive, but squanders it with the pick. Army will start this drive on Navy's side of the field. #ArmyNavy
What an interception by Mike Reynolds! Over the head catch on the sidelines and gets his feet down. Move him to WR?! #ArmyNavy
Army is leading the yardage battle 244-47. Expect Coach Ken to open up the play book to try to shake things up. #ArmyNavy
Army 33 yard FG is Good by the senior kicker, John Abercrombie. Army leads 10-0 late in the 3rd quarter. Navy’s struggling offense needs a big play to change the momentum. #ArmyNavy

Critical juncture in the game for both teams. Army driving late in the half with a chance to go up two scores. #ArmyNavy
Navy is losing the turnover, yardage and time of possession battles but finds itself down one score with the ball. #ArmyNavy

Army is a heavy favorite at -7, the largest spread in recent memory. O/U is at 40. #ArmyNavy
We do not expect weather to be a factor today as it has been it recent games. #ArmyNavy
