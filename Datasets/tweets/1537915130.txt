Remember that corporations are globalist at their core. Cheap, plentiful labor. Business is not on your side. Amazon, Dell, Walmart all lobby for open boarders. Why do you think there is no wall. Why pay an American a decent wage when you can exploit an immigrant.

@SaraCarterDC @WhoWolfe I have no hate for these people, they are being used. Fix your own country.
@ChuckGrassley @kush479 The Democrats are NOT your "friends" across the isle. This is war. They smile and shake your hand and then send minions upon you. Wake up. Muslims hoards invading 🇪🇺. Our southern boarder wide open. All sanctioned by your "friends" across the isle. Wake up!!!
We will be fighting a Muslim Europe in twenty years time. Is everyone stupid? WTF?! Not a shot fired. It will be our fight. They invade from within, and they will take EU political power as easily as they took Europe. I feel sick watching this.
Make no mistake, we are at war. This is not politics. This is the beginning of civil was. The democrats are guilty of treason. They are lobbying for an invasion. They want you guns, your taxes. They want you to pay for the invasion. I feel a storm brewing.
@AmyMek You were all warned. Time and again. Over and over. The democrats in this country, who are guilty of treason, lobby for the invasion. Now you see what they are. Now you see. Too late. Your politicians are corrupt.
