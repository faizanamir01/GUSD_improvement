The #MaduroRegime deployed it’s most trustworthy security forces to the border last week to keep out humanitarian aid out of #Venezuela. But in the last week over 17% of them have abandoned the regime &amp; defected. No tyranny can survive for long with a 17% defection rate.

Will soon file bill making immediate expensing permanent &amp; tax corporate buybacks same way as dividends. No tax advantage for buybacks over dividends. But we’re going to give permanent preference to investments that will drive the creation of jobs &amp; increase in wages. 	 	9/9
Right now don’t have a “free market”. We have tax code which engineers economy in favor of inflating prices of shares at the expense of future productivity &amp; job creation. If we are going to use tax code to incentivize behavior, it should be investing in productivity &amp; jobs 		8/9
The irony is many businesses,if they could make own choice, would rather reinvest profits in improving their product &amp; improving workers’ skills than return it to shareholders. 		See the arguments of respected corporate attorneys like Martin Lipton: https://t.co/veOOECZoW4	 	7/9
I support free market over socialism b/c market better than govt at encouraging investment &amp; innovation needed for widespread prosperity. But tax code discourages best aspect of free market by giving buybacks a deferral advantage over dividends or investment	 	6/9
The argument buybacks are good because frees up $ to reinvest in other businesses growth isn’t backed up by the facts. 		Over last 40 years money back to shareholders has tripled as a % of our GDP, but investment into business dropped by 20%. 	 	5/9
This is evidenced by fact that over the last 4 years our largest corporations borrowed money in order to fund buybacks &amp; dividends. This money they borrowed did nothing to make company more profitable or productive. And they have to pay interest on the money!	 	4/9
Why are profits not being invested into company or new companies? Because our economy driven by large &amp; active investors who pressure for increase earnings per share.Investment pools that prefer safe returns over long term investment &amp; executive compensation based on stock 	3/9
Since 1980 have steady trend of corporate profits flowing back into financial markets &amp; less of these profits invested in increasing productivity through innovation, technology, equipment etc. The result is not enough increase in productivity, growth or widespread prosperity 2/9
The justification for corporate buybacks is company has no better investment available. This may be true for any company from time to time. But what does it say when it is true for many companies year after year? 	 	1/9

The amnesty offered by President @jguaido to the military should be honored by the U.S. &amp; international community. The goal of the legitimate government is the restoration of democracy in #Venezuela, not a purge of the military.
13 European nations now recognize Interim President @jguaido as legitimate leader of #Venezuela. Next logical steps:		- seize #MaduroRegime assets in their respective countries &amp; place at the disposal of the legitimate govt; and		- contribute to intl humanitarian relief efforts

Maduro even uses #Venezuela food program “CLAP” to buy regime elite support through corruption:		Regime elites: 	- import food at inflated prices &amp; take kickback;	- then siphon off some of the imported food &amp; sell for profit 		This must come to an end now. 		4/4
He blames sanctions for economic conditions. But the fact is:	- Until last week,all sanctions were on individuals,not government; &amp;	- the cash from oil sales never reached the people. It was used to buy &amp; maintain the loyalty of top military leaders &amp; regime elites. 		3/4
This is why #Maduro refuses to allow any humanitarian aid to enter #Venezuela. He knows that if people no longer depend on him for food &amp; medicine, they no longer have any reason to even pretend they support him. He has weaponized hunger &amp; disease. 2/4
For years now Maduro has used food as a tool to control #Venezuela.		To receive food through the so called “CLAP” program you must not only vote,but vote for Maduro (yes they know how people voted). 		If you are caught opposing Maduro,you lose access to the “CLAP” program. 	1/4
#Venezuela is hungry &amp; in need of medicine.		U.S. &amp; other countries will be helping govt of President @jguaido get food &amp; medicine into #Venezuela.		Military leaders must now decide if they will help get the aid to the people or if they will follow Maduro’s orders &amp; block it.
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I dedicated you,		Jeremiah 1:5

The correct headline should be Venezuela’s generals pledge allegiance to Maduro. 		The top brass &amp; the midlevel officers &amp; rank and file are not the same thing. These generals make lots of $ from Maduro corruption. Soldiers suffering like everyone else.   https://t.co/fbUgjImsWA

U.S. support is at the request of constitutionally legitimate President of #Venezuela &amp; echoed by over 11 nations in region. 		And for serial interventionist #Putin (Ukraine, Syria, 2016 U.S. elections) to call for non-interference is really something else https://t.co/W27SoMXfrl
The most important action the U.S. can take immediately on #Venezuela is to be prepared to work with our regional allies &amp; the international community to provide food, medicine &amp; other humanitarian aid in coordination with President @jguaido.
Loyalty of generals &amp; loyalty of military is not the same thing in #Venezuela because the chain of command is severely compromised. Military brass knows they would have mass desertions if they ordered attacks on civilians. 2/2
Many in media have focused on how military loyalty may keep Maduro in control of #Venezuela. But the key isn’t the generals at the press conferences. It’s the mid-level officers &amp; rank &amp; file who don’t benefit from corruption &amp; have friends &amp; loved ones marching in streets 1/2
Oil ban &amp; status quo are not the only options.		Natural resources of #Venezuela belong to the people of Venezuela not the dictator Maduro. @Valero &amp; @Chevron should work with 	President Guaido to make sure payment for oil reaches people not Maduro regime.	 https://t.co/Dc2ykRw4IS
The administration of @realDonaldTrump deserves lots of credit for this. The effort against Maduro regime is a regional partnership not a unilateral U.S. dominated effort. And Trump administration has been careful not to act without the consensus of our democratic partners. https://t.co/NCoNSnhHTt
Biggest buyers of Venezuelan oil are @ValeroEnergy &amp; @Chevron. Refining heavy crude from #Venezuela supports great jobs in Gulf Coast. 		For the sake of these U.S. workers I hope they will begin working with administration of President Guaido &amp; cut off illegitimate Maduro regime.
Look at the long &amp; growing list of nations who recognize the legitimacy of President Guaido in #Venezuela. 		Now compare that to the ones who still openly support Maduro:	- Cuba	- Turkey	- Russia	- Iran	- China	- Bolivia	- Nicaragua

Today an extraordinary coalition of Latin American nations along with Canada &amp; France joined the U.S. in recognizing President @jguaido as legitimate leader of #Venezuela. @realDonaldTrump deserves tremendous credit for being willing to take bold action that made this possible.
Even in America, on the issue of #Venezuela, this time is different. #Venezuela is trending #1 on twitter. https://t.co/tBsFTG1xPz
Ridiculous tweet by major U.S newspaper:		So far 13 other nations,including 11 Latin American ones plus Canada &amp; France took the same “unusual &amp; provocative step”. But since Trump did it they conclude it must be bad.		Truly extraordinary bias. https://t.co/ltb58pdkNq
U.S. diplomats in #Venezuela should present their credentials to President @jguaido. Maduro has no authority to expel anyone. 		And trust me on this one, if Maduro is stupid enough to test @realdonaldtrump by harming any U.S. diplomat, the consequences would be swift &amp; severe.
Some U.S. media outlets portraying recognition of President @jguaido of #Venezuela as some unilateral American action. 		At least 13 other nations have done the same: 	Argentina	Brazil	Canada	Chile	Colombia	Costa Rica 	Ecuador 	France	Guatemala	Honduras	Paraguay 	Panama	Peru
Jeanette &amp; I are saddened by the tragic crime today in #Sebring, #Florida. Please pray for the families of the victims. We are grateful for our law enforcement officials who brought this incident to an end before more people lost their lives. #Sayfie
Today after @jguaido assumed the Presidency under the constitution of #Venezuela the country’s sovereign bonds rallied. Why? Because the market believes Maduro’s end is near &amp; a better future is ahead.
President @jguaido has asked us to remain. The United States should NOT comply with this illegitimate order from Maduro.		It should be made clear that we are prepared to take all actions necessary to guarantee the safety of our diplomats in #Venezuela. https://t.co/r4mNnNmqJ0
Maduro has no legal authority to end relations with the U.S. or expel our diplomats. Legal authority rests with President @jguaido who has asked the U.S. &amp; other nations to stay in #Venezuela. The U.S. should not comply with this illegitimate demand. https://t.co/FGuameaeVS
Maduro has no authority to expel U.S. diplomats or end diplomatic relations. The legitimate President @jguaido has asked U.S. diplomats to stay in #Venezuela.  Our diplomats leaving would be tacit acceptance of Maduro legitimacy. Under no circumstances should we leave. https://t.co/Bf3X1EBNCT

A picture of just one of the various meeting points in #Caracas today calling for the end of the Maduro regime &amp; restoration of Constitution. Massive turnout across dozens of cities across #Venezuela. Today is much different than past protests.   #23Ene https://t.co/qzOBCwQul8
The regime’s response is being directed by #Cuba’s intelligence agency. Expect them to undertake a massive disinformation effort,cut off internet,use agitators to provoke violence &amp; ultimately accuse members of National Assembly of treason &amp; terrorism. 4/4
Todays protests are not simply people trying to get rid of a dictator. These marches are asking the military &amp; other organisms of government to recognize the legitimate government as prescribed by the Constitution they swore to uphold.  3/4
The “election” held by Maduro was not constitutionally valid;therefore Maduro is not a legitimate President		Under Constitution when a vacancy exists in the Presidency,the President of National Assembly assumes role of President &amp; within 45 days calls for new elections 2/4
March to restore constitutional order &amp; democracy in #Venezuela set to begin at 10am #Caracas time (9am Eastern in the U.S.). 	Important to know context behind todays events. They are entirely  rooted in the constitution of #Venezuela 1/4
Media covering #Venezuela protests today should keep in mind that Maduro regime’s response openly directed by #Cuba’s intelligence agency the G2. They have already planted fake evidence &amp; will use agitators posing as protestors to provoke violence &amp; then blame the opposition.
61 years ago #Venezuela overthrew a dictatorship. Today, just like January 23, 1958, is a historic day for Venezuelans marching against #Maduro’s narco-terrorist tyranny and raising their voice in support of the Provisional President of #Venezuela @jguaido. https://t.co/jvhQ8KXJKo

Bill will also 	- allow migrants to apply for asylum in home country instead of having to make the dangerous journey to try &amp; cross the U.S. border	- extend for another 3 years protection for those under TPS from Haiti,Honduras &amp; Nicaragua
Next week Senate will take up bill that:	- Extends TPS &amp; DACA	- Funds disaster relief 	- Funds humanitarian aid for migrants 	- Ends #Shutdown		But Dem leaders reject it because includes some Border Security money.		This is completely irrational obstructionism
.@POTUS offers to support two bills sponsored by Dems in exchange for Border Security &amp; the instant reaction from Dem leaders is No. Because denying him a win on border matters more to them than paying fed workers or 3 yrs of certainty for TPS &amp; DACA recipients.
Media commentators &amp; columnists love to bash @POTUS when he makes over the top claims &amp; comments. 		But the offer he made today to end the #Shutdown goes beyond what many of them have been suggesting for weeks. 		Will they now bash Dem leadership for being unreasonable?
@POTUS offers to support 2 bills sponsored by Dems (TPS &amp; DACA extensions)in exchange for Border Security (something Democrats claim to support) &amp; the immediate response from Dem leaders is No? 		I hope rank &amp; file D’s don’t go along with this strategy of unreasonable obstruction
#Shutdown can only end through mutual concessions that lead to an agreement.		It appears @POTUS will offer concessions this afternoon. 		I hope Democrats won’t just automatically reject his offer. 		Demanding his unconditional surrender is not a reasonable position.

Today facing pressure &amp; threats from the Maduro regime,the National Assembly of #Venezuela took the courageous step of passing a military amnesty and a transition law. 		The time has come for the U.S. to join Brazil &amp; Colombia &amp; stand ready to support @jguaido.
America is a blessed nation. We should continue to have a generous immigration policy. 		However our government also has an obligation &amp; right to promote &amp; defend our national interests by placing limits &amp; requirements on immigration &amp; expecting immigrants to comply with them.
Over 60 countries including the U.S. have stated that Maduro is not the legitimate President of #Venezuela. 		I have asked @POTUS to recognize @jguaido as the legitimate transitional President of #Venezuela if the National Assembly invokes Article 233 of the constitution.

Families with children are unlawfully crossing the border in record numbers. It is overwhelming our border agents &amp; creating a dire humanitarian crisis. 		This is a crisis. It needs to be addressed immediately. But Democratic leaders would rather win the shutdown.
The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble. Those who know your name trust in you; you never forsake those who seek you, LORD.		Psalms 9:10-11
The U.S. has declared Maduro Presidency illegitimate. 		Under constitution of #Venezuela in the ab­sence of a pres­i­dent,the head of the  Na­tional As­sem­bly assumes pow­er un­til new elec­tions. 		Which is why U.S. should recognize @jguaido as legitimate President.
The current Democratic position on shutdown is “no compromise” &amp; @POTUS unconditional surrender on border security.		What happened to all the lectures from commentators about the need to compromise? 		I guess  for them “compromise” means when 3 or 4 Reps vote with the Dems.
As long as desperate people believe that they are going to be able to cross our border many are going to go on the dangerous journey from Central America trafficked by some of the most dangerous people on earth. From that standpoint alone it’s a crisis:  	https://t.co/6YaRPgAzWd

The shutdown is not the reason Senate Democrats don’t want to move to Middle East Security Bill.		A huge argument broke out at Senate Dem meeting last week over BDS. A significant # of Senate Democrats now support #BDS &amp; Dem leaders want to avoid a floor vote that reveals that.

This is a lie. 		My bill doesn’t punish any political activity. It protects the right of local &amp; state govts that decide to no longer do business with those who boycott #Israel.

The good news is that the U.S. economy is booming		The bad news is that the benefits of this boom aren’t reaching all Americans		We need policies that address the serious structural problems in our economy &amp; help restore opportunity &amp; the dignity of work		https://t.co/doF7UNxXmW

#Russia isn’t “withdrawing” bombers from #Venezuela. Those planes were never going to permanently deployed. 		Real question is what will they do before leaving? Will they provocatively patrol over Gulf of Mexico accompanied by Venezuelan fighter jets?  https://t.co/bU8YyXiBwj
Maduro is likely to order #Venezuela Air Force fighters to accompany Russian bombers on any patrols over the Carribean.  		But if that patrol extends to flying into &amp; over the Gulf of Mexico it would be an extremely provocative move he may soon come to regret.

In short, Dem lawyers came to Florida to get judges to change Florida elections laws, AFTER the election. That isn’t a strategy to win an election, that is a strategy to steal an election. 4/4
#Florida law requires a manual recount of “undervotes” in close races &amp; provides a clear standard for determining whether a voter intended to vote for a candidate.		Now Dem lawyers want a judge to order Florida to ignore this intent standard when reviewing “undervotes” 3/4
For example, #Florida law requires that the voter signatures on mail ballots match the signature of the voter. 		But Dem lawyers are asking a judge to throw that law out &amp; force Florida to count ballots with signatures that don’t match the voter signature on file. 2/4
Imagine if NFL team was trailing 24-22 but in final seconds hits a 3 pt kick to win. Then AFTER game lawyers for losing team get a judge to order rules changed so that last second field goals are only 1 point		Well that’s how democrat lawyers plan to steal #Florida election 1/4

The same people who are quick to use the term “Voter Suppression” to describe everything from Voter ID to closing early voting sites on time, are also quick to condemn as hyperbole &amp; baseless criticism of blatant &amp; rampant election irregularities &amp; violations of election laws
No fraud?		Fine. Then what is the right word for Broward submitting vote totals that include ballots disqualified by canvassing board (as reported by @MiamiHerald)? 		Or Palm Beach illegally making duplicate ballots without submitting to canvassing board?		https://t.co/u3i1m6ZNKB
This exposes how deceitful some on the left are about #FloridaElection. #MiamiDade cast more votes than #BrowardCounty &amp; voted 60% for Democrats. But no one is complaining about their election department. Because they are competent &amp; also follow the law. 	https://t.co/OtcLYmvseD
Deadline for recount is Thursday. #PalmBeach already said they won’t make it. #BrowardCounty just started recount today,3 days after most every other county &amp; will probably miss as well. Demanding they follow law isn’t effort to stop vote count,its effort to stop law breaking
Left wing commentators have no shame just making things up. 		This piece is a work of fiction. No one is stopping #Florida recount. Only thing we ask is they follow the law 		Be transparent. Report updated votes every 45 minutes. Finish recount by deadline https://t.co/Ik3YJh8mg1
#BrowardCounty &amp; #PalmBeachCounty are headed towards being only counties to not make deadline for machine recount		Potentially deliberate effort to delay final count hoping a judge will order domestic vote by mail received after 7pm #ElectionDay counted, in violation of state law
Incompetent law breaking election officials lead to chance for lawyers to steal an election		Dem lawyers aren’t here to make sure every vote is counted. They’re here to get as many votes for their client as possible counted &amp; get as many votes for opponent as possible thrown out
Wrong. It is the #BrowardCounty canvassing board that claims her vote is illegal, not me. 		If what your reporting found is accurate, then you have confirmed what I have been saying, that we have ample reason to carefully scrutinize the actions of the BrowardElection supervisor. https://t.co/Rwei3HG03n
Every vote legally cast &amp; received within timeframe required by law should be counted. 		The issue in #Florida has been the repeated violations of election law by &amp; the incompetence &amp; the lack of transparency of #PalmBeachElections &amp; #BrowardElections.

Miami Dade is a county Democrats win big. But you don’t see anyone freaking out about their election department. Because so far they have processed more ballots than #BrowardCounty elections dept &amp; did so in a timely, competent &amp; law abiding way. https://t.co/JAmODBY9wJ
The “demographics” of #PalmBeach voters is Americans &amp; Floridians. 		“Unfortunate” is your refusal to count their votes in accordance with the law.

Wanted to take a moment &amp; recognize the excellent work of local television &amp; newspaper reporters covering #FloridaElection. 		The election controversy is a prime example of why local outlets are so important. They have the experience to provide proper context to readers &amp; viewers
#Florida mandates machine recount in close races &amp; are generally straightforward		However subsequent manual recount of “over votes” &amp; “under votes” must be transparent. Because that’s when lawyers change outcome by getting certain votes counted or rejected https://t.co/4JVJaol1XQ
#BrowardElections office admits the vote count they submitted to state includes 22 illegal votes. 		We know about these 22 because they got caught breaking law in reviewing 202 ballots. How can anyone trust more illegal votes aren’ in their final count?		https://t.co/DiLApbnGbx

Maybe this box found this morning has office supplies in it. But if it contains just a single vote, it should have been handled in accordance with the law, NO MATTER WHO IT WAS A VOTE FOR. https://t.co/lfZ2Up6UDW
I don’t know what’s in this sealed box found this morning by #BrowardSheriff. But this dysfunction in #BrowardElections is not acceptable. 		At a minimum it undermines public trust in the election &amp; creates opportunity for mischief.		#Sayfie https://t.co/OOcGA3ffL1

According to @Floridianpress earlier this morning #Broward Sheriff’s office discovered voting equipment &amp; what is purportedly a sealed Provisional Ballot Box left behind in Tamarac Lakes Community Center https://t.co/TANHmMC8Ux
Why all the lies from left about GOP trying to stop votes from being counted?  To distract from lawlessness. 		#BrowardElections mixed 20 illegal provisional ballots with 185 legal ones. Now illegal ones can’t be identified.	 	 https://t.co/3HNBqIfrtG https://t.co/MJmzNo7zzU
If a “Red County” did what #BrowardCounty &amp; #PalmBeachCounty are doing, they would march in the streets &amp; confront Republicans about it in restaurants		But because it’s happening in a “Blue County” they create increasingly novel &amp; creative arguments to justify it. 3/3
They make straw man argument that we must “Count Every Vote”		They say we are misrepresenting #Florida law,even though 2 separate judges today found violations		They say claim of past misconduct by #BrowardCounty is unfounded even though ignoring years of local media coverage 2/3
Many of the same people in media &amp; commentary class who are always warning about “threats to our democracy” are excusing or deflecting attention from the blatant lawlessness in #Broward &amp; #PalmBeach undermining the credibility of &amp; public confidence in our elections 1/3
Want more lawlessness?		#BrowardCounty elections opened 208 provisional ballots without canvassing boards approval as required by law		After admitting error submitted them to board which found at least 12 are invalid		Guess what? They are going to count all 208 of them anyway
How can anyone defend this lawlessness?		Court orders #PalmBeachCounty Elections Dept. to follow law &amp; submit “over-voted” &amp; “under-voted” mail ballots for an open &amp; public review before they are counted		They are refusing to comply with the court order		https://t.co/faBLokHJTV
Frederica we have worked together for over a decade. Which is why this statement is so disappointing. 		Respectfully,can you show me where I have asked them to stop counting votes?		All I asked is that Broward comply with the law. Laws a judge today found they were violating https://t.co/BhxXgmHwGo
It is not unusual for a county to continue to report updated vote counts until 1st report due Saturday		What’s unusual(&amp; violation of law)is refusing to report updated votes every 45 minutes,refusing to disclose # of ballots received &amp; taking 5+ days to complete early vote count
For those who continue to claim #BrowardCounty is in compliance with early vote reporting laws here is the state report as of 8:12pm Friday. 5 days after last early vote was cast they remain ONLY county which still has not completed its early vote count  https://t.co/dSoidpqcRg

Court has just ordered #BrowardElections supervisor to turn over vote counts. Furthermore,the court found her to be in violation of state public record laws. 		https://t.co/atCE7eMn2X
A new &amp; troubling allegation has emerged. A statement under penalty of perjury that #PalmBeachCounty filled out new ballots to replace damaged ones without allowing campaign representative to witness the process of creating the new ballot as required by #Florida law
How can anyone excuse #BrowardElections blanket refusal to reveal the number of ballots cast,counted &amp; left to be counted? Knowing how many ballots they have in their possession is one of the most important things they are required to keep track of.
If #BrowardElections has some legitimate reason for why they have been unable to tabulate &amp; report ballots they have had since Sunday night,like every other county did,they should disclose it. Instead they continue to operate under an indefensible shroud of secrecy. 4/4
2. In addition,they are required by state law to submit results every 45 minutes. The last update from them was over 20 hours ago.		3. Every ballot they receive has to be logged. Why have they consistently refused to disclose how many they have left to canvass &amp; count? 3/4
Conduct of #BrowardElections office is in blatant violation of state law. 		1. No early votes have been cast since Sunday. They had 2 days to tabulate them &amp; submit to state by 7:30pm Tuesday as required by law. Yet as of latest update these are still only partially completed 2/4 https://t.co/mmzJVZ6H5H
AFTERNOON UPDATE on #BrowardElections in the thread below:		Some partisans continue trying to portray what is happening in #BrowardCounty as normal &amp; criticism of it as effort to stop vote counting. 		This is an effort to deflect attention away from highly irregular conduct 1/4
Fair question. 	 	No one is asking them to stop counting votes. 		I am asking them to:		1. disclose how many ballots they have in their possession which still have to be canvassed &amp; tabulated; &amp; 		2. Submit tabulated ballots to Dept. of State every 45 minutes as required by law. https://t.co/ocMXlcgXIT
Not very comforting to #Florida voters that #BrowardCounty supervisor,in whose hands may rest outcome of Senate &amp; cabinet race has in the past: 	1. Illegally destroyed ballots	2. Secretly opened mail ballots	3. Sent voters too many ballot pages	4. Left const question off ballot

Under #Florida law county must upload by 7 p.m. day BEFORE election ALL early votes canvassed &amp; tabulated by end of early voting &amp; report results within 30 minutes of polls close		60 hours after that deadline only 1 of 67 counties is still counting early votes, #BrowardCounty https://t.co/oP7HdpZcTk
Recounts in close races are automatic under #Florida law &amp; I support a #FloridaRecount2018 100%.		What is happening in #BrowardCounty isn’t about a recount. As Dem lawyer said "We're doing this not just because it's automatic,but we're doing it to win," https://t.co/w2y03m9Ay6

When did I ask anyone to stop counting? And how is criticizing repeated election failures by same election official a fight to stop vote counting?

A nation whose most visible leaders &amp; institutions rely on anger to motivate people will eventually become a nation of very angry people. 		Anger can make good people take irresponsible &amp; destructive actions. But Anger will lead evil people to take horrifying &amp; tragic ones. 4/4
Great movements are always based on optimism &amp; inspiration. 		But optimism requires more patience than fear. 		An outrage based media focuses coverage on anger &amp; generally ignores inspiration.		And our culture rewards harsh rhetoric &amp; views measured words as weak or boring 3/4
History offers numerous examples of social &amp; political movements built primarily on tapping into &amp; stoking anger. To varying degrees they had some early success, but none of them ended well. 		And many of them caused great suffering &amp; tragedy on the way down. 2/4
Our core problem isn’t “Incendiary rhetoric” it’s the Anger it taps into &amp; stokes. 		Anger moves people to donate &amp; vote. And outrage is good for media ratings &amp; online traffic. 		Because anger is one of our most powerful emotions. But it is also one of our most destructive. 1/4
All bitterness, fury, anger, shouting, and reviling must be removed from you, along with all malice. Ephesians 4:31
While HATE is a sad feature of our fallen nature,tapping into ANGER for political gain is a choice. One both the left &amp; right now fully embrace. And while the politics of ANGER may not driven by HATE, those who do HATE can be driven to violence by the politics of ANGER.
.@BretStephensNYT not sure what your response has to do with my tweet which was clearly about the mail bomber not the antisemitic Synagogue attack as evidenced by the fact it was written before the attack &amp; was a RT of something I wrote earlier in the week about the mail bomber. https://t.co/ab74KK3hOb
Yesterday was a tragic reminder that the ancient evil of antisemitism is still with us. That among us lurk those who do not just say or write horrible things, but could, at any moment, turn hatred into unimaginable violence. https://t.co/IXmM2Mtq56

Why is it so hard to accept that a clearly deranged man carried out deranged acts? The “false flag” conspiracy theories on one side &amp; the “it’s Trump’s fault” on the other shows how unhinged politics has become. This isn’t incivility. It’s a society that has lost common sense. https://t.co/qBN44H3Cmk
I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Ezekiel 33:11

All nations have divisions,but our republic requires compromise between divided groups. That’s not possible if we view those we disagree with as evil. We all claim we want compromise &amp; civility,but we have a culture,politics &amp; media fueled by outrage &amp; biased against compromise.

Yes words matter. Because freedom of speech allows us to air &amp; settle our disagreements &amp; grievances using words INSTEAD of violence.

We need to be firm on “caravan” but also smart. If we end training &amp; equipment to #Honduras &amp; #Guatemala,it will become easier to ship drugs here. And it will empower MS13 &amp; other dangerous gangs to continue to terrorize people,who will then eventually leave &amp; come illegally.
Our aid to #Honduras &amp; #Guatemala isn’t charity. It helps us more than them. By seizing drugs before they enter U.S. &amp;  kill Americans. And it’s border security because it helps fight the gangs that are terrorizing the people who ultimately wind up on our border.
I understand instinct to cut U.S. aid to punish countries for failing to stop illegal migration. But our aid to #Honduras &amp; #Guatemala isn’t cash. It’s primarily equipment &amp; training to stop drugs headed to U.S. &amp; to deal with the gangs causing people to leave those countries.
Saying you think they should all be allowed in &amp; processed is an open invitation for more “caravans”. This is not some authentic &amp; organic migration. This is a highly choreographed effort to challenge our immigration laws &amp; dare us to enforce them.
Lots of focus on what @potus said about cutting foreign aid &amp; fact checking whether terrorists are part of “caravan”. But little discussion about what should be done if they make it to our border. Every candidate for federal office in the midterms should be asked that question.
Today @Potus will sign the #WRDA bill. We still have lots of work ahead of us,but this was an important bipartisan achievement for #Florida &amp; #Everglades.  https://t.co/vSRSJO4tzu #Sayfie

A prominent critic of the Saudi government, living in the U.S. was murdered,in a third country,inside a diplomatic facility,by close associates of the Crown Prince. Any explanation which claims he knew nothing about it is simply not credible.

While unlawful migration to U.S. from Central America is caused by real crisis,the migrant “caravan” was manufactured by supporters of a radical agenda who are using poor &amp; desperate people to try &amp; embarrass &amp; undermine the U.S. in the region. But it’s going to backfire on them.
The #KhashoggiMurder was immoral. But it was also disrepectful to Trump &amp; those of us who have supported the strategic alliance with the Saudi’s. Not only did they kill this man,they have left @potus &amp; their congressional allies a terrible predicament &amp; given Iran a free gift.

#Sayfie https://t.co/M8TlssFNPj
#MexicoBeach is total devastation. Tonight at the EOC I was able to view drone images that had just come in from this afternoon. Their were audible gasps in the room from officials who responded to some of the worst disasters in recent history. Images in thread to follow: #Sayfie
Restoring power going to be a long &amp; difficult task. The grid is shredded. Enormous number of crews on the scene &amp; more on the way. But it will take several days to assess damage,then trees will need to be removed before work begins. It’s the worst I’ve seen since Andrew #Sayfie https://t.co/sCYRKGu2nj
#PanamaCityFlorida has suffered catastrophic damage. Biggest immediate challenge is restoring phone service,primarily from the areas biggest carrier @Verizon. Have been in touch with them &amp; are hopeful service will be up again tonight #Sayfie
Just spent several hours with incredible first responders from Bay County &amp; across #Florida &amp; country. Many do not even know the condition of their own homes or loved ones,but are on the job around the clock. Thank You!	Update on conditions on the ground in this thread to follow:
The damage to the electric system in Bay County is extensive &amp; widespread. Restoration begins with removing downed lines &amp; rebuilding key components. It will not be easy or fast but the best restoration crews in the world are on the job &amp; will get this done. https://t.co/Y34rvDs97u
At junction of SR20 &amp; SR79 beginning to see signs of storm damage. But also signs of the work being done. A 7 truck caravan of power restoration vehicles headed into Panama City passed by just now. #Sayfie

Most people are only starting to get a sense of how pervasive #China commercial spying is &amp; the damage it is doing to our national &amp; economic security. We are finally starting to do something about it. But it is long overdue.  https://t.co/HCC2OCIBm1
Just met with @FEMA_Brock &amp; @Norad_Northcom at @fema office in DC to get an update on Federal efforts to assist #Florida after #hurricanemichael. Now on my way to #FloridaPanhandle #EmeraldCoast to meet with local officials.  #Sayfie https://t.co/prlzVmyvIB
Fed response to Hurricane underway. Focused first on stabilizing 8 critical lifelines:		1. Safety &amp; Security		2. Food,Water&amp;Shelter		3. Healthcare 		4. Power &amp; Fuel		6. Telecommunications		7. Transportation: roads blocked,bridges need inspection		8. Hazardous Waste		#Sayfie
It will take a long time to recover from this. We will do everything we can to make sure the federal government does it’s part. But I will confess that my biggest fear that this part of #Florida, with its unique &amp; genuine characteristics, will never be the same.  #Sayfie
Highway 98 which connects communities along the coast was washed out at several points. Will complicate efforts to get assistance to several impacted communities. #Sayfie
Mexico Beach is an old old #Florida town. It’s charm is that it feels like a trip back in time to a place unspoiled by development. I was told this morning that is is “gone”. #Sayfie
Panama City is a vibrant seaside city. Popular vacation spot for both families &amp; college students. Early reports from locals is catastrophic devastation. As it was described to me, the electric grid won’t need to be restored, it will need to be rebuilt. #Sayfie
#Florida primer on this thread just so those outside state understand a little bit about NW part of the state. It is a place we fell in love with as a family years ago &amp; have spent many long weekends enjoying #Sayfie:
As the sun rises on NW #Florida the early reports I am getting on damage is stunning. I have not yet seen it myself but local leaders are telling me that the damage in Panama City is catastrophic. And one said “Mexico Beach is gone”. #Sayfie

I’m as pleased as anyone that we successfully confirmed a conservative to the court. And I too want to keep the GOP majority. But in the long run we all lose if tribalism permanently disfigures America &amp; leaves us a nation of people who hate each other. https://t.co/pc5nJlr4Xv
Imagine the coverage on cable news if an angry mob of conservatives stormed the steps of the Supreme Court building. It wouldn’t be the breathless giddiness we are seeing right now. It wouldn’t be awe at the bravery of someone climbing up on the statue of Lady Liberty.
Can you imagine what democrats &amp; many in media would be saying if it was conservatives ambushing them at restaurants,confronting them at home,disrupting Senate hearings &amp; vote with primal screams &amp; now literally banging on door of Supreme Court building? They would call it a mob.
One of the most ridiculous observations I have heard in media today is how close this vote was. It was going to be close even if these allegations had never emerged. Senate Democrats were going to reflexively &amp; immediately oppose any of the names on Trump list.
SCOTUS vote was about a specific nominee facing specific &amp; ultimately uncorroborated allegations. Some now gloating about how its going to help win elections. Others stir rage &amp; now tears from victims by portraying it as referendum on sexual violence. Just terrible for America.
I’ve seen FBI “report” too:	1. Interviewed ALL those named as present at gathering where alleged assaulted occurred:	2. Not one could recall any such gathering much less an assault:	3. After over 150 interviews no one has ever told FBI that Kavanaugh drugged or assaulted anyone; https://t.co/6wk88zqiW2
Most will never know the full extent of the efforts to intimidate &amp; threaten @SenatorCollins on the #Kavanaugh vote. I am not talking about political pressure or people screaming at her in an elevator. I am talking about vicious, vile &amp; dangerous actions. She is legit. https://t.co/XVYQ4pDvg6
The founders created the Senate to protect our broader national interests against mass sentiment &amp; momentary passions. That kind of Senate is no more. Instead of protecting us from a mass sentiment of anger &amp; tribalism, the modern Senate has become its most powerful showcase.
I don’t just know @SenatorCollins from tv,I know her in real life. No Senator works harder to arrive at the right decision. Sometimes we don’t agree,but I know her decision on difficult questions is based on research &amp; strongly held principles. Her speech today is vintage Collins https://t.co/XVYQ4pDvg6
My Kavanaugh vote based on facts we have about specific allegations in this specific case.  After 7 background checks with over 150 people interviewed over 2 decades by FBI &amp; not one of them has knowledge of him sexually assaulting anyone. My speech here: https://t.co/8d4CPcGTRH
LORD,you have probed me,you know me:you know when I sit &amp; stand;you understand my thoughts from afar. You sift through my travels &amp; my rest;with all my ways you are familiar. Even before a word is on my tongue, LORD, you know it all. Psalms 139:1-4
#RedTide confirmed in #MiamiDade. Some beaches now closed. This is a statewide crisis for #Florida. Red Tide has been around for centuries but never like this. Will keep fighting for $ for research &amp; for passage of WRDA bill next week in Senate. #Sayfie	https://t.co/4He29VaT6x
The bill we passed yesterday is a big win for South #Florida &amp; recovering addicts &amp; bad news for corrupt sober homes. We still need to do more, but this was very important. Expect the President to sign it very soon. #Sayfie  https://t.co/wusGMwRg3y
To date,the named witnesses deny knowledge of Dr. Ford’s allegations against Judge Kavanaugh &amp; no independent corroboration of allegations has emerged. This morning I will review new FBI report. If it provides no corroborating evidence I will vote to confirm #Kavanaugh tomorrow.
But you who say, “How shall we persecute him,	seeing that the root of the matter is found in him?” Be afraid of the sword for yourselves, for your anger is a crime deserving the sword;that you may know that there is a judgment. Job 19: 28-29
Our new law which goes after the patient brokering causing #Florida’ #SoberHomes crisis has passed &amp; is now on it’s way for the President to sign into law.  Thanks to the #PalmBeach Heroin &amp; Sober Homes Task Force &amp; @aronberg for all your help. #Sayfie https://t.co/cttscX3zyQ
Tomorrow, as part of the Opioid bill, we will pass &amp; send to POTUS our bill to prohibit kick-backs by #SoberHomes. We worked with @aronberg &amp; other local leaders in South #Florida on this &amp; are grateful to them for their input &amp; advocacy. #Sayfie
Today we passed &amp; sent to POTUS our Post-Disaster Fairness to States Act as part of FAA bill. It places a 3 year statute of limitation on @fema clawing back funds after completion of projects following disasters.  This is very important for local governments in #Florida. #Sayfie
These deals aren’t just about money. The 21st Century will be driven by big data. Whoever controls big data will control the important industries &amp; innovations. That is why you see #China companies pursue these deal. They want to own big data on Americans https://t.co/8NArmrtUcJ
More at stake in #IranDeal than just #Iran. #Putin is working hard to get #EU &amp; others to help Iran circumvent U.S. sanctions because if successful it would create a precedent &amp; a roadmap for #Russia to evade sanctions in the future.
Trade dispute is having a very negative impact on public confidence in economy of #China. Expect them to make moves soon to stabilize renmibi,allow wholly owned subsidiaries in more industries &amp; provide unemployment benefits for workers who lost their jobs due to trade dispute.
This article is wrong in claiming that the selection of new Iraqi PM &amp; President leaves no clear winner between #Iran &amp; U.S.. The clear winner is Iran. IRGC leader Soleimani personally brokered this deal. This is a major &amp; troubling development. https://t.co/2zJV7EKjOv
#NorthKorea goal is getting sanctions removed. To achieve this they are working on 2 things:	1. Driving wedge between U.S. &amp; S.Korea;	2. Force U.S. to accept step by step process where every one of their “concessions” met with a reciprocal sanction removed https://t.co/uAfweFZudB

Be still before the LORD; wait for him. Do not be provoked by the prosperous,nor by malicious schemers. Refrain from anger;abandon wrath;do not be provoked;it brings only harm. Those who do evil will be cut off,but those who wait for the LORD will inherit the earth. Psalm 37:7-9
“The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away;	blessed be the name of the LORD!”  In all this Job did not sin nor did he charge God with wrong. Job 1: 21-22
If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna,* into the unquenchable fire. Mark 9:43
This could have happened weeks ago without violating Dr. Ford’s request for confidentiality if her claims had been handled appropriately instead of leaked to press. And Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly stated yesterday he would support whatever additional inquiry committee decided on
An @FBI interview of those mentioned by Dr. Ford as being at the scene of the alleged attack is prudent. The more information we have the better.
I know how the bad traffic is coming from Kendall. But our water crisis is the single biggest threat facing #Florida. If MDX doesn’t buy &amp; swap all the land needed for #Everglades restoration, I will make sure fed agencies do not approve this project. https://t.co/AJRQIZERWN
Anyone claiming harassment or assault should be taken seriously &amp; be heard.

All the norms that once governed our politics &amp; public discourse are gone. Today,my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee,on both sides,have an opportunity to set a better example for our country by treating Dr. Ford &amp; Judge Kavanaugh with respect &amp; listening without prejudgement

Not true that sanctions have helped Maduro successfully argue that he is victim of an “economic war’’. Same argument always used to oppose sanctions on left wing regimes. #Venezuela people know sanctions are on individuals &amp; regime is cause of suffering https://t.co/WTAo64F3C0
Those being sanctioned because of Maduro should know that a path exists for some of you (but not all of you) to getting them lifted. Take meaningful action to restore democracy,refuse to violate human rights &amp; speak out against the regimes abuses.   https://t.co/CMJe83mgeQ

There was no greater support of @NATO than @SenJohnMcCain. I am drafting a Senate resolution supporting the naming of new #NATO HQ after him &amp; calling on @USNATO to support this move. As McCain loved to say when asked why he held a certain position “it is the right thing to do”.
Heard that people close to President of #Guatemala @jimmymoralesgt are pushing him to switch from #Taiwan to #China. I hope he doesn’t listen to them. Leftist Anti-American govt of #ElSalvador will soon lose U.S. foreign aid don’t want that to happen to Guatemala as well.

Compare actions of @MDCollege admin with that of @UofNorthFlorida which recently cut ties with Confucius Institute.  Taxpayer funded higher education should not be a forum for foreign influence campaigns, especially from a serial human rights violator like #China government.
They don’t ask because @MDCollege admin doesn’t want to lose the $ #China government gives them through the Confucius Institute. They use it to influence faculty &amp; students towards China’s narrative on global events including #Tibet, #Taiwan etc. on our taxpayer funded campuses.

Those of us who worked with him will miss him. None of us can be John McCain. He had a unique personality &amp; rare life experiences. But this is a good opportunity for all of us to remember the best attributes he brought to the Senate &amp; examine how each of us have fallen short. 5/5
Third,his raw authenticity. I never saw him trying to be someone he was not. Popular or not, he was going to say &amp;/or do what he he thought needed to be said &amp; done. 4/5
Second,his stubborn sense of justice. When he saw something unjust or unfair,nothing stood in the way of speaking his mind &amp; nothing could get him to back down. He was oblivious to politics or public pressure when it came to right &amp; wrong. 3/5
First, his energy &amp; work ethic. He could grind long hours for days on end. An overseas trip with @SenJohnMcCain started at 6am &amp; ended at midnight. And if he found any open time on the itinerary he would add some new meeting or unexpected side visit. 2/5
I only knew @SenJohnMcCain from TV before I was elected in 2010. The man I came to know personally was someone who made a deep impact on me. It wasn’t the issues that left a mark,we agreed on many but disagreed on more than a few. It was the three things. 1/5

If Ortega-Murillo regime in #Nicaragua gets a big loan from #Russia to bail them out of crisis they created, it will confirm what I have been arguing for some time, Ortega is #Putin closest supporter in Latin America &amp; therefore a national security risk to U.S. we must address.
The U.S. response to #Panama &amp; #DominicanRepublic switching from #Taiwan to #China is NOT the way we will react if #ElSalvador does the same. If they do this I will have no choice but to immediately begin work to end their funding &amp; remove them from #AllianceForProsperity plan.

Arguing we shouldn’t ban #ZTE because then all the business will go to another #China spy company #Huawei isn’t a  reason to let ZTE stay,its a reason to go after Huawei as well. But if we aren’t willing to take on #ZTE we will never take on a much larger company like Huawei.
The #ZTECave endangers passage of an important &amp; good bill &amp; every argument for caving is weak. A sanctions compliance official on the board won’t stop backdoor access to routers. A big fine is small price to pay compared to value of info they will steal. https://t.co/SalNbc6Mxd

The spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the LORD,	and his delight shall be the fear of the LORD. Isaiah 11:2-3
Nueva ola de ataques por parte de las pandillas paramilitares de #OrtegaMurillo en #Monimbo #Masaya. Ahora vienen las consecuencias para Ortega y Murillo por esta delincuencia. #SOSNicaragua
Images from earlier this morning of what sources inside #Nicaragua describe as blue shirted #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gang preparing to attack. https://t.co/GZUAl6HSbw
At this moment the parish church of Mary Magdalene in #Monimbó #Nicaragua is being targeted by #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gang. At least one priest is trapped inside.
Receiving reports from inside #Nicaragua of a new wave of violent attacks by #OrtegaMurillo paramilitary gangs in  #Monimbo #Masaya. The situation is rapidly deteriorating.
#Helsinki &amp; subsequent reaction showed #Putin achieved goals of interference:	1. Weaken next President with nagging &amp; persistent allegations;	2. Weaken public confidence in our political parties,media &amp; govt agencies; &amp;	3. Weaken U.S. by inflaming partisan &amp; cultural divisions
Scoundrels, villains, are they who deal in crooked talk. Shifty of eye,feet ever moving,pointing with fingers,They have perversity in their hearts,always plotting evil,sowing discord. Therefore their doom comes suddenly;in an instant they are crushed beyond cure. Proverbs 6:12-19
#Putin’s interference in 2016 didn’t elect Trump &amp; it doesn’t mean we don’t deal with him on other issues. But we can’t afford to forget he always exploits weakness. If we don’t acknowledge &amp; punish what he did,his next attack on us will be bolder,more brazen &amp; far more damaging.
Foreign policy must be based on reality,not hyperbole or wishful thinking. And the reality is #Russia is an adversary. Because #Putin doesn’t believe in win/win scenarios &amp; thinks only way to make Russia stronger is to make U.S. weaker. Any approach not based on this will fail.
Been making this point for 5 years now. Economic growth doesn’t distribute through economy the way it once did. The rising tide of a booming economy doesn’t necessarily lift all ships anymore. Why I pushed for #ChildTaxCredit &amp; now #PaidFamilyLeave  https://t.co/qZzKXulGG5
Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the LORD speaks: Sons have I raised and reared, but they have rebelled against me! Isaiah 1:2
RT @partlowj: Inside the church where Nicaraguan paramilitaries laid siege on university students https://t.co/smNaRxHbA7
I will listen for what God, the LORD, has to say;	surely he will speak of peace to his people and to his faithful. May they not turn to foolishness! Psalms 85:9
Several wks ago I personally told #Nicaragua F.M. Denis Moncada Colindres that opportunity still existed to avoid cycle of conflict with U.S. if they held early &amp; fair elections. But Ortega/Murillo regime responded with more violence making very clear the path they have chosen
Watch LIVE the developing situation in #Nicaragua via 100 NOTICIAS NICARAGUA https://t.co/NV3po0caHQ via @YouTube We are awaiting the promised release of the students, journalists &amp; clergy trapped inside church by armed Ortega gang. We know of at least one fatality inside.
These are the bullets these Ortega paramilitary criminal gangs are using &amp; this is the consequence. An unarmed student shot in the head overnight, taken into church by fellow students who could not ambulances in to rescue him, &amp; he died this morning. 4/4 https://t.co/0PS0E0pBgU
This ongoing attack &amp; siege is being conducted by paramilitary gangs which are armed &amp; controlled by Ortega &amp; his wife/VP Rosario Murillo. They will be held directly &amp; personally responsible for those who have already died or been wounded &amp; any others who die or are wounded. 3/4 https://t.co/z0u35b7WHU
Outside church &amp; Non-Govt leaders are pleading &amp; praying to be allowed access to tend to the injured &amp; release those trapped inside. But apparently Ortega government intends to kill those students &amp; journalists remaining. 2/4 https://t.co/bqttWrhpkx
Ortega paramilitary gangs continue to fire on Divine Mercy Church in #Nicaragua where journalist, student &amp; clergy remain trapped. Ambulances are outside ready to assist but Ortega gangs will not allow them in.  1/4 https://t.co/2s7S24q4Ld
Those who are wise in their own eyes,prudent in their own view!.. who acquit the guilty for bribes &amp; deprive the innocent of justice!..their root shall rot..;..For they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of hosts &amp; scorned the word of the Holy One of Israel. Is 5:21,23-24
When these “Opportunity Zone” projects end up transforming long forgotten communities across America their will be one person who will deserve most of the credit for making this possible &amp; that is ⁦@SenatorTimScott⁩   https://t.co/f38t7ClRWC
Ambulances must be allowed to enter church immediately &amp; remove the wounded before someone loses their life. If anyone dies because of this deliberate delay by the regime,Ortega &amp; his wife will be held personally responsible. The ambulances are outside building,let them in now https://t.co/7T9c6HKWmA
Despite my frequent disagreement with the way some in media cover our politics,tonight we got a powerful reminder of why press freedom is worth protecting. @partlowj from @WaPo was interviewing student protestors in #Nicaragua when Ortega regime attacked university. https://t.co/D1uzwZ1EVK
After their paramilitary gang attacked church &amp; natl univ #UNAN tonight the Ortega regime must immediately end the attack,allow the injured to be taken to hospital, release U.S. journalist @partlowj immediately from &amp; allow everyone else to leave as soon as possible #Nicaragua
Divine Mercy parish church in #Nicaragua under attack by Ortega paramilitary gang. Serious injuries but Ortega not allowing medical personnel to enter. This is part of coordinated simultaneous attacks tonight by these gangs in several places including the National Univ #UNAN https://t.co/Spd62TVw19
Continuing to confirm other reports receiving tonight from inside #Nicaragua. In addition, independent media outlets have been forced off the air &amp; only government version of events is being broadcast inside country right now. https://t.co/GysIhy1Iy9
Also the neighborhood where many U.S. embassy employees live is under attack. That is not a coincidence. Ortega, his wife (who is also the VP of #Nicaragua) &amp; those empowering him will be held directly responsible if any hard should come to any U.S. personnel or their families
U.S. journalist for @WAPO @partlowj is trapped inside a church under siege by Ortega thugs. Reports serious injuries but Ortega forces not allowing ambulances to enter &amp; render aid. https://t.co/D1uzwZ1EVK
At this moment Ortega thugs are setting fire to #UNAN the national university of #Nicaragua trying to either smoke out student protestors or be burned alive. Have been informed a Jesuit priest &amp; a U.S. journalist from a major outlet are among those trapped inside.
A few hours ago Ortega ordered Paramilitary gangs &amp; security forces to attack #UNAN students &amp; a catholic church. Reports &amp; video coming in of severe injuries &amp; fatalities. Also reports that several non-regime controlled media outlets have been taken off the air. #NicaraguaSOS https://t.co/UOSgVLz0Ct
Situation tonight in #Nicaragua is rapidly &amp; dangerously escalating. Ortega &amp; those in his govt are on notice that if any harm comes to U.S. personnel or their families he will personally face severe repercussions &amp; if his violence leads to a bloodbath he will face consequences
3rd, #Putin will do this again &amp; it will be even more difficult to stop. Changing voter registration data,strategically timed deep fakes, targeting congressional enemies &amp; races with outsized national influence, these are just some of the things we could see in 2018 or 2020. 4/4
Second,the most influential yet unwitting collaborators of the Putin effort was the media which extensively covered every salicious detail of the leaks, but spent little time looking into who was behind the hacking &amp; their motivation. 3/4
While Putin may have developed a preference for Trump that wasn’t his primary objective &amp; that isn’t why he won. His goal was to exacerbate our political divisions &amp; get us to fight each other even more. Something we already do a pretty good job of ourselves without his help 2/4
I dont “believe” Putin interfered in our elections I know for a fact he did. But some important nuances are being completely ignored in the analysis, coverage &amp; partisan reaction to todays indictments. 1/4
#Florida’s #EmeraldCoast is our once “well kept secret” that isn’t so secret anymore. The proof is the growing number of 30A stickers I am seeing in the most unexpected of places. The word is out about #NWFlorida https://t.co/7Qk9CuqGYr

Translation: Good news, paychecks have increased. Bad news, prices have gone up by even more. Prices growing faster than wages is great for profits. But very bad for working families. We need to do more for American workers. #PaidFamilyLeave would help.  https://t.co/950qpAWOkq

Spoke about this yesterday. https://t.co/2zLEG5y0MM #Putin does not seek “better relations” with U.S. he seeks an equality with U.S. he believes is only possible if America grows weaker &amp; Russia stronger. For him our relationship is a competition that can only have one winner 5/5
Nearly impossible to truly “partner” with #Putin because he views geopolitics as zero sum competition &amp; the world as place where the strong prey on the weak. That’s why he seeks to make Russia a great power equal to U.S. &amp; why his true interest is gaining an advantage.  4/5
#Putin is always looking to exploit what he perceives as vulnerabilities of foreign counterparts. He will weaponize their personal information while carefully guarding his own. He will try to make counterparts appear anxious or indecisive &amp; himself as unemotional &amp; in control 3/5
#Putin views &amp; personality formed growing up in the Soviet society. No leader can have a good relationship with him because he trusts no one. And partnering with him is difficult because he views geopolitics as a zero-sum competition in which the strong prey on the weak. 2/5
No one has been a harsher critic of #Putin than I have been. No one. But with 90% of the worlds nukes controlled by #Russia &amp; U.S. we have no choice but to meet with him. That said, we should clearly know who Putin is &amp; what he wants. 1/5 https://t.co/2KWovmTlgA via @WSJOpinion

I will rather boast most gladly of my weaknesses in order that the power of Christ may dwell with me. Therefore, I am content with weaknesses,insults, hardships,persecutions &amp; constraints for the sake of Christ;for when I am weak,then I am strong. 2 Cor 12:9-10

It’s hard to balance our laws &amp; our values (as the nasty comments which will soon follow will no doubt prove). But we must do it. Because open borders is wrong. And so is dehumanizing people, the vast majority of whom are fleeing threats to their families from gangs &amp; violence
Our sovereignty requires us to secure our borders,enforce the law &amp; discourage illegal migration. Our Judeo-Christian values command us to treat those unlawfully here as children of God, worthy of compassion &amp; of our respect for their God given dignity https://t.co/Ip30Wua1Ve
Our tech firms reject U.S. military,but embrace Tsinghua which supplies tech to #China’s military. @HEWLETTPACKARD sold them their China-based server, @intel invested $1.5 billion, @Dell has strategic partnership &amp; @IBM allows them to license advanced tech https://t.co/F4Ua6IfDp9
Example of hypocrisy of many U.S. tech companies. Refuse to work with U.S. military on #ProjectMaven but work with partners tied to China military. For example @Google's @Jeffdean serves as #AI advisor for univ tied to key tech supplier to China's military https://t.co/F4Ua6IfDp9
It’s a very simple question,should #ZTE a company subsidized &amp; ultimately controlled by #China govt &amp; which poses a natl security threat to U.S. be shut down by denying them access to American high-tech or should they pay a big fine &amp; stay in business? https://t.co/tdKf619vPc

Our goal is not to make #MadeinChina2025 fail. Our goal is &amp; must remain a U.S. &amp; #China relationship that is balanced &amp; a competition that is fair instead of one China wins as a result of cheating &amp; theft of our intellectual property.   https://t.co/Qp52z8kPgE
In many ways America is stronger than ever. But our shared national identity is in trouble. The erosion of non-political ties to one another has increasingly left us with politics as the primary source of our individual identity &amp; as the primary influence in how we view others.

Immigration issue is hard b/c our sovereignty requires us to have borders. Our history requires us to remember we are all immigrants. Our constitution requires due process. And our Judeo-Christian values requires us to show compassion. No other nation has to balance all that!

Actually more like 2 screaming people who apparently support a release policy that encourges already vulnerable migrants to bring children with them on dangerous journey to unlawfully cross U.S. border.

Won’t be easy to house families together,but we must do it. Because we can never again go back to policy of either separating families or releasing everyone. Yes,separating families is cruel. But so is release policy that incentivizes adults to unlawfully cross border with kids https://t.co/AkJHctj4to
Should pass bill we filed asap. It creates capacity to hold families together,sets standards for family detention,hires judges to speed up their hearing process,but also ends the release policy that enticed parents to bring children on dangerous journey to unlawfully enter U.S.
Visited Homestead shelter for migrant children. We must make sure they are safe &amp; cared for &amp; held together with parents as soon as possible. But we MUST also end the cruel policies which incentivize parents to bring kids here on such a dangerous journey. https://t.co/rr3jH2N2Uu

Earlier today I spoke on the Senate Floor about our immigration issues and the need for Congress to act if we want to enforce the law &amp; also keep families together. Watch here: https://t.co/RlY78TZiAO
I support a generous immigration system. I support responsibly accommodating those who came years ago as children &amp; those who have been here a long time. But a policy which basically says if you unlawfully enter with children you will likely get to stay forever is irresponsible
Based on Senate speeches Democrat position is: Don’t detain children; Don’t detain their parents either so we don’t separate families &amp;; Don’t deport them if they fail to appear for subsequent hearing. So basically if you enter unlawfully with children we won’t enforce the law?
Great news! The world is waking up to the #China threat. #Britain just held up a China aerospace deal over national security. This is why instead of a trade fight with Europe we should have teamed up with them to confront China together. #TheftTax  https://t.co/dbCaz9XDfq

Just heard Senate colleague on floor say U.S. detains immigrant children “indefinitely &amp; indiscriminately”. That is just PATENTLY FALSE. They are entitled to due process hearing so not indefinite. And only applies to those who enter U.S. unlawfully so its not indiscriminate.
Some Democrats now even using the disingenuous “indefinite detention” term. They know full well that those who unlawfully enter the U.S. are not held indefinitely. They are entitled to a due process hearing &amp; our new bill hires more judges to speed up that process.
The ink isn’t even dry on the new executive order ending separation policy &amp; some Democrats already arguing that keeping families together isn’t enough. Now they want them &amp; their parents released after unlawful entry knowing full well that high % will never appear for hearing
It is cruel to separate families. But it’s also cruel &amp; irresponsible to return to policy that encourages bringing children on a very dangerous journey. Our bill will change the law so families will remain together while awaiting prioritized proceedings.  https://t.co/e1nTp60q4p
Bill was just filed led by @SenThomTillis &amp; many others like @SenatorFischer The executive order today does NOT take away the need for Congress to act. We need to get rid of the “Flores Settlement” or a court ruling could lead to same problem again. https://t.co/yvun8XyMcy

Returning to a policy that only adults with children are released would create an incentive to bring kids. Yes separating families is cruel,but so is a policy that encourages parents to bring their kids on a dangerous journey. Instead lets #DetainandMaintain families together

Do not let anger upset your spirit, for anger lodges in the bosom of a fool. Ecclesiastes 7:9
If every Senator is willing to support it by unanimous consent, the Senate could pass a bill, before the end of the week, that would allow families charged with illegal entry to be kept together while awaiting an expedited hearing. I truly hope that is what we do.
Led by @JohnCornyn a group of us are finalizing bill that will allow families to be held together pending expedited hearing. We can &amp; must avoid BOTH creating incentive to unlawfully enter with children AND separating children from their parents https://t.co/Cxrieul3tk
Releasing those who unlawfully enter b/c they came with children creates a cruel incentive to bring children on dangerous journey. Detaining parents is cruel because it separates families. Lets change the law so we can hold families together while awaiting expedited hearings

.@NickKristof I’m uncomfortable with suspending military exercises &amp; if this becomes permanent in exchange for nothing you are 100% correct.

Presidents meeting with #KJU exposed incredible hypocrisy of many in media. When Obama did these things,he was described as enlightened. When Trump does it he is reckless &amp; foolish. 1 yr ago they attacked Trump for leading us towards war,now attack for being too quick for peace
I too have concerns about how all this with #NorthKorea will turn out. But I don’t recall all the “experts” criticizing Obama when he met with a brutal dictator in #Cuba who also oversaw a police state &amp; also killed &amp; jailed his opponents. #DoubleStandard  https://t.co/j5x6wPiMGb

This lunacy has gone too far. The CEO of @Twitter bullied into apology for patronizing @ChickfilA because owners support “biblical definition of marriage”. Holding a personal view taught by mainstream Christianity is now boycott worthy. https://t.co/EnChlPBStc via @cbsmoneywatch
I STRONGLY support trans-Atlantic alliance &amp; wish ⁦@POTUS⁩ would have dealt with #China before turning to trade with allies. That said, some seem to forget that his first obligation is to the American people not to the alliance.  https://t.co/dY7QZpK4Bn
Our #TaiwanTravelAct signed by @potus pushes for more high level visits. Opening of the compound in #Taiwan is perfect chance to start doing it. #China bullying &amp; breaking promises on Hong Kong justifies Taiwan lack of enthusiasm for “reunification”  https://t.co/173r5D5QMs

Thorns &amp; thistles it shall bear for you,&amp; you shall eat the grass of the field. By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread, Until you return to the ground, from which you were taken; For you are dust, and to dust you shall return. Genesis 3: 18-19
Many valid points here. Our allies do impose unfair tariffs &amp; non-tariff barriers on us. But we should first have worked with them to focus solely on #China &amp; then dealt with these issues after. Read: The Era of American Complacency on Trade Is Over https://t.co/bdDF6orO8I
One point is missed in this analysis. If #China tech companies use protection given by govt to grab  dominance in 5G or A.I. they become global standard &amp; will dominate development in the fields that depend on those technologies like autonomous vehicles. https://t.co/dv0KS11mAl

Why is #ZTE and #Huawei a big threat? #China already on verge of becoming global leader in 5G. Will have full scale deployment by 2020 &amp; have approval for stations in Europe. This will allow them to dominate autonomous vehicles &amp; Internet of Things. All using tech stolen from us

This is how far our domestic political derangement has come. Summit failure blamed on lack of “message discipline” by Trump officials &amp; not on the paranoid dictator who inherited, not earned, his power, &amp; who stays in power through deception &amp; murder https://t.co/mXHlwuiApp
Kim Jong un stays in power through force &amp; deception &amp; believes nukes give him prestige &amp; reduce chances of U.S. attack. He never wanted a nuke deal,he wanted as much sanctions relief as possible without giving them up. Unfortunately the options on dealing with him are narrowing
Yes they have a deal in mind. It is a great deal... for #ZTE &amp; China. #China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy &amp; they use these telecomm companies to spy &amp; steal from us. Many hoped this time would be different. Now congress will need to act.  https://t.co/ETMUCe9ia6

True. But #MajorKey its not every day a quote from Miami’s own fits so perfectly. #AnotherOne https://t.co/n8Ma7ZJoes
Kim Jun Un, in the words of a wise man “Congratulations, you just played yourself”. Withdrawing from talks with #NKorea is 100% the right decision. #KJU doesn’t want a deal. He has deliberately sabotaged the talks over the last two weeks &amp; was setting us up to take the blame.
#NKorea “shutting down” test site is a show to make #KJU appear cooperative &amp; responsible.  Bottom line is they either give up nukes &amp; missiles or they don’t. I suspect they don’t want a deal,but want U.S. blamed for it so international sanctions collapse  https://t.co/swc5F8YsKv
Time will tell whether they can report on China without interference. We should watch this closely. I hope they can pull it off and be able to report honestly and openly. Had ok article yesterday. We shall see. But if not, they should be registered as foreign agent.

Can’t emphasize enough what a crisis this is. #China is buying &amp; often stealing the next-generation software that powers our military &amp; is at core of our economy. We need to wake up before it is too late. @JohnCornyn has new law we should act on ASAP. https://t.co/wbx1Tp8w9D
The end of terrible #IranDeal &amp; quick &amp; decisive response to fake election in #Venezuela is testament to the fact that with @SecPompeo @stevenmnuchin1 &amp; @AmbJohnBolton in place, @POTUS now has a team that will execute, not block, his orders on foreign policy.
Here is #ZTE timeline: Violated U.S. sanction laws &amp; got caught lying &amp; covering up. Paid $1billion fine &amp; agreed to discipline employees. But then lied again &amp; instead of discipline gave those employees bonuses. Now we are offering same deal of fine &amp; employee discipline?
Sadly #China is out-negotiating the administration &amp; winning the trade talks right now. They have avoided tariffs &amp; got a #ZTE deal without giving up anything meaningful in return by using N.Korea talks &amp; agriculture issues as leverage. This is #NotWinning https://t.co/5kGO3qRGfY
Being a tool for espionage &amp; theft of U.S. intellectual property is bad enough. But #ZTE was sanctioned because it blatantly broke previous agreement with U.S. &amp; vi­o­lated sanc­tions against #Iran &amp; #NorthKo­rea. But we trust them with a new agreement? https://t.co/LXxihRykqz
If this is true, then administration has surrendered to #China on #ZTE Making changes to their board &amp; a fine won’t stop them from spying &amp; stealing from us. But this is too important to be over. We will begin working on veto-proof congressional action https://t.co/LXxihRykqz
Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we shall go into such and such a town, spend a year there doing business, and make a profit” you have no idea what your life will be like tomorrow. You are a puff of smoke that appears briefly and then disappears. James 4:13-14
Blaming John Bolton for N.Korea threats last week is ridiculous. More than anyone else our friends in S. Korea know full well that Kim Jung Un actions are same tactics they has used in the past to divide opposing side &amp; thereby gain leverage before talks. https://t.co/ccuFAao7zz
Facing dissatisfaction within his own governing party Maduro thought sham election would help consolidate his power. Instead it consolidated sanctions &amp; isolation. Now he will concentrate power in a smaller inner circle &amp; many party leaders are about to be marginalized or jailed.
Maduro very wrong if he thinks fake election will alleviate sanctions. @POTUS just imposed new sanctions that restrict the regime’s ability to earn kickbacks through sales of state assets &amp; that prohibit buying any debt owed to Govt of #Venezuela,including debts owed to @PDVSA

@LeonardPittsJr1 You admit none of your friends or family supported Trump. Yet despite not knowing any Trump voters personally you know they are motivated by bigotry &amp; racism. I guess labeling an entire group based on stereotypes, what you saw on tv &amp; limited personal knowledge is ok after all.
@LeonardPittsJr1 That is just false. That report does not say anywhere that Trump voters were motivated by “racial animus” In fact it found that: “white working-class Americans are roughly as likely as Americans overall to believe many minority groups face substantial discrimination in society.”
@MelissaAmour72 @LeonardPittsJr1 Actually upper middle class,well educated Republicans is one of the subsets of Republicans he did poorest among. And the bigot argument is undermined by the fact that in several key states the election was decided by working class voters who voted for Obama in 12  but Trump in 16
@LeonardPittsJr1 And defining 63 million voters as motivated by bigotry based on the actions of some people at a rally is like judging the entire fan base of the Philadelphia Eagles because of the riots after the Super Bowl.  And it doesn’t explain similiar convulsions in Europe, Brexit etc.
@LeonardPittsJr1 Not accurate. Data indicates party registration was the top vote predictor. The 2nd was feeling like a “stranger in their own land” which is driven by a fear that a rapidly changing economy &amp; society no longer values people like them &amp;/or no longer shares their traditional values
@LeonardPittsJr1 In a republic, engaging with the people on the other side isn’t some noble gesture, it’s the ONLY thing that works.  We may want to divorce each other, but we will never be able to get separated. So we better figure out how to live together, or none of us will ever be happy. 2/2
@LeonardPittsJr1 Most voted for him despite those things, not b/c of them. He connected with workers hurt by the global economy &amp; people who feel forgotten by both parties. Answer isn’t to marginalize 1/2 our people. It’s proving we can address their concerns without forgetting who we are 1/2
@LeonardPittsJr1 Your new column actually proves my point. My tweet wasn’t about Trump,it was about your contempt for the Americans who voted for him. The people you now write we need to marginalize b/c they have “neither the capacity nor the interest” to be reasoned with. https://t.co/l67k513A6p

In #UsVsThem @ianbremmer gets it right about Trump voters. They “aren’t stupid or mean spirited.” They just feel that “that too many politicians care more about universal ideals than about American workers &amp; families.” It is a great disservice to America to ignore these concerns
Just read #UsVsThem by @ianbremmer It outlines how while our divisions weren’t created by Trump, they do explain his victory. He’s right that “those who dismiss (Trump) supporters are damaging the U.S.” It’s why we need an #AmericanConservatism that addresses their legit concerns https://t.co/NA6x7yp6mx

The more we learn, the more it appears the problem is not the program or the DOE guidance itself, but the way it is being applied. It may have created a culture discourages referral to law enforcement even in egregious cases like the #Parkland shooter.

For far too long, Washington has ignored and left behind the American working class. Increasing the refundability of the Child Tax Credit from 55% to 70% is a solid step toward broader reforms which are both Pro-Growth and Pro-Worker.
