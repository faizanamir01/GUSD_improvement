Almost immediately following this disastrous decision, states who had a history of voter discrimination based on race, began implementing rules to once again suppress votes under false claims of "Voter Fraud. 	 #VRA53 	https://t.co/WVLqbm3D4f
2013:		After decades of progress and strengthening of our democracy, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the #VRA freeing nine states, mostly in the South, to change their election laws without advance federal approval. #VRA53 	 https://t.co/GWnIeM43KC
1975:		President Gerald Ford reauthorizes the special provisions of the Voting Rights Act, including new measures to permanently bar literacy tests nationwide and give assistance to language minority voters.  #VRA53 https://t.co/aYuagBLsmT

By the end of 1965, 250,000 new black voters are registered, 1/3 of them by Federal examiners. #VRA53 https://t.co/JHcH6O1468
Just as important as those protections was the requiring of jurisdictions	with a history of discrimination in voting to get federal approval of changes in their election laws before they can take effect and the monitoring of those places with a history of discrimination. #VRA53 https://t.co/oTp6W8TiMI
1965:	President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the #VotingRightsAct into law, permanently barring direct barriers to voting by racial and ethnic minorities,prohibiting election practices that deny the right to vote on account of race. #VRA53 https://t.co/xfgA2Rj36W

Are you seeing a pattern here? Over a century after the country was founded, there are still large groups of people being denied the vote. Those groups are decidedly non-white.  #VRA53 https://t.co/3jhmJRfHLc

5:30pm 3/7/1965: Brown Chapel AME was surrounded by Sheriff Clark, State Troopers, and possemen as law enforcement blocked off the entire area so no one could enter or leave. Neighbors who went to help were forced back into their homes with billy clubs. https://t.co/hfCElyt6yl
4:25pm 3/7/1965: As law enforcement shoot tear gas and chase demonstrators while on horseback, marchers run back towards Brown Chapel AME. “I’ve never seen anything like it in my life!” one witness says.

They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call BS. That us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.
They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS. They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars. We call BS.
Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call BS.
Companies are trying to make caricatures of the teenagers these days, saying that all we are self-involved and trend-obsessed and they hush us into submission when our message doesn't reach the ears of the nation, we are prepared to call BS.
The people in the government who were voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and our parents to call BS.
