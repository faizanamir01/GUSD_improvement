“Without it we don’t have a free nation.”		@BetsyDeVosED emphasizes the importance of #1A in front of a packed crowd of students just steps from where the Constitution was drafted.
“True freedom is ultimately ordered toward virtue and responsibility...America is exceptional because of her freedoms.” @BetsyDeVosED
“Too many institutions have tried to pursue truth and harmony, and ended up failing at both.”
“Learning is about thinking, reasoned argument, and discovering facts. If ultimately there are no facts, no objective truth, then there is no learning.”
“Learning is nothing if not a pursuit of truth,” remarks @BetsyDeVosED. “Yet students are often told there is no such thing.”
“What’s happening on campuses today is symptomatic of a civic sickness.”
“Disagreement about deeply held beliefs can raise passions, but violence is never the answer.”
“All too often students do not learn about our Constitution and our freedoms in the first place,” notes @BetsyDeVosED.
“Too many administrators have been complicit...in making it easier for hecklers to win.”
