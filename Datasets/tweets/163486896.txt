The president’s calls for unity and bipartisanship in #SOTU are beyond meaningless. Coming from him, they are insincere and offensive. ALL of his words and actions over the last two years have demonized our community, harmed families, and divided our country.

The UnidosUS familia mourns with #ElPuente the passing of #LuisGardenAcosta – a powerful leader and recipient of the 2015 UnidosUS Maclovio Barraza Award for Leadership.  Luis cared deeply about community and justice, and his passion touched the lives of many. RIP.
The networks may have been in a no-win situation but they definitely have egg on their faces after airing this racist campaign rally rant as a “prime-time address.” #TrumpAddress
The President tonight re-hashed his greatest hits of immigrant-bashing, fear, bigotry, and racism.   This was the same old nonsense.  This speech was three years of his insane tweets, with spelling and grammatical errors corrected by Stephen Miller. #TrumpAddress
It’s deeply concerning that the networks are giving @realdonaldtrump airtime for a PR stunt for his ludicrous wall. Those same networks must fact-check what will no doubt be a speech filled with untruths and more lies. @WeAreUnidosUS will also be fact-checking the speech live.
Creating a southern border wall is a stupid idea—it’s costly and ineffective. Let’s call out this POTUS speech tonight for what it is... a trumped up crisis and publicity stunt, plain and simple.

Final note to Carlson: free speech extends to sponsors and advertisers. And having your own tv show is not among the rights guaranteed by our Constitution. Thank you, @pacificlife, for starting the ball rolling on finally holding Carlson accountable.
And like with Dobbs, Carlson and his apologizers are screaming “free speech”. This is not about the 1st amendment. Dobbs/Carlson have every right to say all the hateful things they want. They do not, though, have the right to be free from criticism, challenge, or condemnation.
Same thing needs to happen with Carlson. What’s different from 2008 is that many more realize that his talk of immigration is just a dog whistle of racism and demagoguery. This is about stoking fear &amp; resentment, not honest reporting.
What is happening now mirrors what happened exactly 10 years ago with @LouDobbs on @CNN. We confronted him with the facts of his racism on his own show. And we and our partners ended Dobbs’ platform of hate on CNN.
15 advertisers and counting have pulled ads from @TuckerCarlson’s show and deservedly so. His relentless immigrant bashing is steeped in ugly bigotry and lies, not to mention White nationalism. Yet, he has doubled down on his immigrants make America “dirtier” rant.

Bottom line: @realdonaldtrump’s empty, political, and bigoted demagoguery is standing in the way of solving the immigration issue and harms our country.
A real solution means working with the nations of Central America to address complex root causes and recognizing that insults and threats do not constitute an effective foreign policy.
Trying to paint unarmed families including young children as an “invasion” is needless hype and a craven and false scare tactic. A POTUS should be focused on real solutions, this POTUS can only provide demagoguery. Sad!
The caravan of Honduran migrants is fleeing horrific violence. They are traveling together for safety and to seek refuge. They are not guaranteed refuge in this country but they have every right to ask for it.
As usual, @realdonaldtrump is using a complicated situation to confuse, lie, and demonize. And as usual, he is making a tragic situation worse.

“We are going from big numbers to power — that is our future. But not enough of us are voting and that must change.  We need all our voices.  And in Nov we all need to go out and vote.” @jorgeramosnews tonight, #CHCI2018 Gala Honoree	#Vote #PowerOf18 @WeAreUnidosUS
“We know you lived. And we recognize your humanity even if the President of the United States does not.” Cong. @LuisGutierrez tonight at #CHCI2018 gala receiving legacy award &amp; commenting on the 3000 U.S. citizens from #PR🇵🇷 who perished after Hurricane Maria #HearingsForPR🇵🇷
This president needs oversight and needs accountability for the people of #PR and for all Americans. Repub congressional leadership: do your job. We demand #HearingsForPR. 🇵🇷 7/7
This is a scandal of historic proportions. Republicans, who control both the House and Senate, should be outraged by the admin’s dereliction of duty to millions of US citizens. Yet we have heard nothing from Repub leaders. 3,000 Americans DIED. What are you going to do? 6/7
There is something seriously wrong with any human being – let alone a US president – who privileges his own ego over reality, the truth, and even the lives of the people he purports to serve. But what’s Congress’s excuse? 5/7
This follows on the heels of a @Politico investigation earlier this year that extensively documented how Trump favored the recovery in Texas with Hurricane Harvey over #PuertoRico after Hurricane Maria. https://t.co/7rUcL2JzyG 4/7
The @WashingtonPost and the @KaiserFamFound released a survey of Puerto Ricans that found 80% gave Trump a thumbs down for his response to their once-in-a-lifetime crisis: https://t.co/OQDNrerl69 3/7
3000 Americans died; the largest number in a US natural disaster since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Trump has yet to express any sympathy for these lost lives, let alone acknowledge them. 2/7
.@realdonaldtrump saying that his response to Hurricane Maria in #PuertoRico is an “unsung success” is a cruel and despicable lie. His lying and bullying of officials in #PR – instead of taking responsibility – is a disgrace. 1/7

There are so many steps we can take to end gun violence. We need to follow these young leaders in asking for those steps (background checks, assault weapons ban, etc.) to be taken right NOW. #StudentsStandUp
A majority of Latinos and a majority of Americans want action to end gun violence.  They want no one else to ever again go through this.  They want every student to be safe and secure, esp. at school. #StudentsStandUp
What’s different is that these kids, in the midst of their unimaginable grief and trauma, are standing up and speaking up because their fallen friends no longer can. #StudentsStandUp
The Parkland shooting was senseless, horrific, and shattered families, a community, and a country.  Like #Orlando and #LasVegas.  Our hearts are broken once again. #StudentsStandUp

This administration has not only failed our #DREAMers, but the 90% of Americans who stand with them. The Republican leadership's refusal to accept a bipartisan deal is reprehensible and their actions will not go unanswered. #DreamActNow https://t.co/rU5njtcF66
We get such rare chances to see R’s and D’s work together &amp; come to agreement. The bipartisan #DREAM amendments in the Senate reflect painful concessions but they move the process forward &amp; finally would give #DREAMers relief from fear of deportation. https://t.co/HyApyetgE1
The #Trumpbudget signals the priorities &amp; values of this administration. Not only does it take safety net programs away from families, it includes a harmful anti-immigrant agenda &amp; inadequate infrastructure plan. See the @WeareUnidosUS break-down here: https://t.co/qoPwIgtSWZ

Extremely disappointing to see that Congress has chosen to keep millions of #DREAMers in limbo.  While access to healthcare is being addressed and #PuertoRico will receive much-needed funding, this outcome could and should have been a win for all.
Congress has the ability to address the communities hit by disasters, ensure children have the care they need AND heed the nearly 90% of Americans who want relief for #DREAMers now. It should not be an either-or situation. #ProtectDreamers #DreamActNow
While it is encouraging to see a bipartisan budget deal that would finally fund health care access and disaster relief, it still leaves our #DREAMers without protection and that is unacceptable.

And this is a moment of truth for Republicans. Are they a party of Trump-like bigotry or a party of American values? Will they support a workable solution or cave in to cruel demagoguery? Our community is watching closely.
Appalled but not surprised. Presented w/ a bipartisan proposal, @realdonaldtrump has angry, racist response. We have said from day one that Trump's immigration views are not about the rule of law or policy, they are pure, overt bigotry.
We ended 2017 without relief for our #DREAMers, meaning every day 122 people lose their chance to work, further their education, own a home, or simply provide for their family. We can't wait anymore. #DreamActNow https://t.co/JrHUtQX5sb

It’s clear that the war on Latino children goes on. Led by Republican leadership, Congress just passed a continuing resolution that did not appropriately address health care, disaster relief, or DACA; all programs that impact our children. Shame. https://t.co/cDqUim9Tas https://t.co/SZvwC5FsAD

Y nuestra comunidad no olvidará el devastador impacto de este proyecto de ley, ni quiénes fueron los que pusieron nuestro futuro en juego a cambio de su estrecho interés personal. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/P7fNEBqDPK
Este Congreso dirigido por los Republicanos y la administración realmente han puesto en riesgo el futuro de nuestro país y son los únicos culpables de las consecuencias de sus acciones imprudentes.
Este ataque innecesario al bienestar y el futuro de nuestros niños no sólo está mal, pero también es de poca visión. Estos niños serán la espina dorsal de la fuerza laboral en la próxima década, así que algo que los perjudica a ellos va a perjudicar a todos los estadounidenses.
El liderazgo Republicano en el Congreso y la administración están deleitando a los ricos con un buffet de 'todo lo que puedan comer' y han dejado a nuestras familias y nuestros niños con la cuenta a deber. #GOPTaxScam
y los recortes pequeños y temporales para la gran mayoría de las familias trabajadoras y de clase media estadounidenses, hacen de este proyecto de ley no solo uno desmesurado, sino también obsceno. #GOPTaxScam
Simple y sencillamente, esta es una legislación históricamente mala. Estos recortes de impuestos masivos y permanentes para las empresas grandes y para los estadounidenses más ricos, #GOPTaxScam
This needless attack on the well-being and prospects of our children is wrong but it is also short-sighted. These kids will be the backbone of the American workforce in the next decade so failing them now will hurt all Americans. #GOPTaxScam https://t.co/6uxoHeOE7H
The Republican Congressional leadership and the Administration are treating the very rich to a high-end 'all you can eat' buffet and sticking our families and our kids with the check. #GOPTaxScam
Plain and simple, this is a historically bad piece of legislation. With its massive and permanent tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest of Americans and tiny and temporary cuts for the vast majority of American families, this bill is not only unconscionable, it is obscene.

Pres Trump has more compassion/concern for bigoted, law-breaking Joe Arpaio than #DREAMers serving our country. What a disgrace. #DefendDACA
Not only is stopping ACA subsidies fiscally irresponsible, it would leave many without health coverage according to new #CBOscore.

If Trump is serious about ridding our country of bigotry, he should start with the WH. Fire Bannon, Gorka &amp; Miller. #Charlottesville
But, his comments sound like empty posturing when we also look at policies this admin has put into place that target vulnerable communities.

Excited to represent @NCLR and talk about ending childhood #hunger @NoMasHambre2012. #NoMasHambre
Today I'll be meeting w/several Members of Congress to talk about how we can make comprehensive #immigration reform a reality in 2013.
I'm looking forward to joining @jorgeplasencia &amp; other friends this evening at the beautiful and historic Florida House in DC.
On my way to tape for @TheLastWord with @Lawrence O'Donnell. Tune in to watch at 10 pm EST tonight on MSNBC.
@losviramontes That makes two of us.
@BarackObama acknowledged the importance of the #LatinoVote. Also reaffirmed his support for comprehensive #immigration reform.
Civil rights leaders agree: don't raise taxes on middle class and working families. #FiscalCliff
Just left a White House meeting on #FiscalCliff with @BarackObama. Good mtg w/ strong message. #POTUS says he'll protect working families.
The president just said our top priority has to be jobs and growth. Polling of Latino voters shows they agree.
We know there may be long lines at the polls today. Don't get discouraged. Stay in line. http://t.co/W99pIxnc #Mobilize2Vote #LatinoVote

Thank you to the Domincan Women's Development Center award last night. I was honored to join you.
I'm looking forward to hearing Pres. Obama tonight. I've worked with all our partners to ensure he's heard our concerns! #DNC2012
I'm so proud of all the talented and exceptional #Latino elected officials here at the #DNC2012 this week &amp; at last week's #RNC2012

I’ll be talking about the #LatinoVote with @Telemundo tonight at 9:30 ET. Tune in to watch!
Being here at #DNC2012 really highlights the need for our community to register and turn out to vote! #Mobilize2Vote http://t.co/apOmGT9Q
I can't wait to hear San Antonio Mayor &amp; my dear friend, Julian Castro, deliver the keynote speech. Truly inspiring! #DNC2012
Key takeaway from today's #LatinoVote briefing: We have to be our own champions and stop looking to others to be ours. #DNC2012
I'm happy to be in Charlotte representing the #Latino community. We intend to hold both parties accountable! #DNC2012
Welcome to the #NCLR12 Annual Conference! Thank you all for being here. !Muchisimas gracias!
Follow @NCLR for more analysis on what the #HCRDecision means for our community.
Wow! Great day. Great decision. Time to get back to helping all Americans get the health care they need and deserve.
Just on #mitchellreports, voiced disappointment with remaining "papers please" provision of SB 1070 and with Romney response.
Our first line of self-defense against #SB1070 &amp; copycats is at the voting booth. Register to vote! http://t.co/GPx08CJg #Mobilize2Vote
Today, #SCOTUS failed to decisively remove the bull's eye from the back's of Arizona's Latinos, leaving it to future lawsuits to address.
We're glad that most of #SB1070 was struck down, but upholding "papers please" legitimizes racial profiling &amp; keeps AZ's Latinos in peril.
I applaud Mr. Obama's bold move to end the fear that dominates a DREAMers life--the threat of deportation through no fault of their own.
I'm so honored to be receiving the @civilrightsorg Hubert H. Humphrey Award tonight! #HHH2012
Today, NCLR launches Mobilize to Vote, our effort to add hundreds of thousands more Latinos to voter rolls across the country.

@joncarson44 I was glad to be a part of it! #summerjobs+
Escalera's chief components: career exploration, tech skills devlpmt, leadership devlpmt, personal devlpmt, & academic support. #summerjobs+
The goal of the Escalera Program is to design a replicable program model for serving Latino youth that others can implement. #summerjobs+
NCLR's Escalera Program has been highly successful in engaging low-income Latino youth in developmental employment experiences. #summerjobs+
NCLR's Affiliates are a home base for many youth in our communities & are essential parts of an effective summer jobs strategy. #summerjobs+
The U.S. pop. over age 65 will grow from 13% in 2010 to 20% in 2050. Latino youth will play an important role. #summerjobs+
500,000 youth will turn 18 every year, adding millions of new workers to the population and contributing to future economic growth.
Today’s Hispanic children are tomorrow’s American workers; it is estimated that by 2050, 30% of the workforce will be #Latino.
I’m looking forward to joining the White House today for the “Case for Summer Jobs+2012."
#GOP candidates' extreme positions on #immigration alienate #Latino voters, despite our growing electoral influence. http://t.co/GkGgOsnw

@rosa_velazquez It was an honor to march with you, too! Keep up the good fight. --Yours in Solidarity.

On behalf of the NCLR familia, I want to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving holiday.
Pres. Obama said we must keep putting pressure on Congress to pass the #AmericanJobsAct.
Today at the White House, @Joe_Biden said the #AmericanJobsAct is about dignity and respect. He's right.
Listening to Pres. Obama talk about jobs w/@rweingarten @TheRevAl & @HilaryOShelton, all advocates of the American dream.
I'm glad to see President Obama doubling down on his jobs bill. We need Congress to take action.
Mr. Obama's new housing guidelines are a welcome next step, but bolder solutions are still required. http://t.co/UIGFzo1t
We have to continue to fight Alabama’s HB 56 and other such laws in other states.
Today’s CAP Hill press conference detailed the damages still affecting families in Alabama due to HB 56
I have my marching shoes on,ready to march for economic justice and jobs!
Thanks to everyone for the warm welcome to Philadelphia. I'm looking forward to the #PECO luncheon. #HispanicHeritage
Today, .@rweingarten was spot-on when she said, "Teachers are safety nets, not snitches and guardians, not guards."  #HB56 #immigration
As .@NEAPresident said: The #AL law is having a harmful chilling effect on children. His teachers are reporting heartbreaking stories. #HB56
Also on the press call today, .@splcenter & .@hicatweets. Both groups are doing courageous work in #Alabama to fight #HB56. #immigration
I was proud today to have two powerful #education leaders, .@rweingarten & .@NEAPresident, on a press call denouncing the #HB56 decision.
#HB56 is brutal &unconstitutional. It negates so much of the hard work that #Alabama has done to overcome its dark history w/civil rights.
