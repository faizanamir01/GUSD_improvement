they don’t like flat-chested women		from taipei
all to no avail
macey tseng recognizes on a more rudimentary level, she has an abnormal fetish for occidental men who have graduated from ivy league academies 		macey loves to utilizes them		in a reverse-psychological capacity 		by her inculcating them in the tenets of neofeminista precepts
when ever she’d venture forth in search for new dick		a side hobby of hers		that most other techie women in silicon valley are conversant with
macey tseng would develop an unhealable seeping canker sore 		the size of a dime 		right behind her left eye socket 		causing her night blindness
it’s not that easy		libtard women of pedigree are generally regarded as inept 		and at their very worst, uncouth
at the time, in her own personal history, distraught, macey thought or she grossly erroneously assumed if she fellated or mollycoddled orally the way a good taiwanese-american girl is expected to.....on the peninsula...she might be able to somehow		find ‘a tenable romantic link’
she gave him head, to the best of her own ability, but he refused to reciprocate in kind		she hadn’t been tested for chlamydia yet 		a medical procedure not very popular in san jose. nor in atherton		now, macey tseng remains childless. but still insatiably itchy 		at age 33

there’s always a janky backstory to incompetence related directly to libtard women of pedigree 		for example, perhaps macey tseng dated an italian-american man in her past but he remained aloof and unwilling to reciprocate because macey was unresponsive and frigid. in the bedroom

of course, both women spy, they have to—but in unique’s case, she participates purely in the capacity of it being nothing more than a preemptive defense mechanism 		whereas, in ms. tseng’s situation, she gets horny often and has to watch handsome caucasian men take hot showers
ms. tseng tries to shrug it off but everybody on this side of the aisle sees right through her false pretentiousness

a euphemism for globalism
they operate under the aegis of ‘the new green deal’
while she outsources machine-driven algorithms to other lackluster joint venture capitalists with a major axe to grind 		all beijing supported		the initial funding
she knows she doesn’t have the technical expertise to get hired in menlo park as a neophyte civil rights liaison officer 		so instead, zir labors in the capacity of an industrial espionage catalyst 		since it’s a lot cheaper
the only reason that ‘the eunuch from atherton’ is as assertive as she is, is because zack, the chief financial officer of fritter, encourages lacey to exact out ‘social justice’ retribution 		as if that, in and of itself, were a merit badge 		lacey is striving for brownie points
not to mention the fact zir sends you gratuitous salamander pics every third week of the month		to your tumblr account 		none of it aesthetically appealing to say the least
you never want to play ‘pin the donkey’ or ‘whack the piñata’ with a highly volatile disjointed taiwanese-american shemale who masquerades as a data scientist 		she already has you geotagged
i don’t want to think about it
jesus christ, imagine her on a limewire scooter
stacey can barely parallel park as it is
uniess they get in a car accident
that’s why it should be illegal for taiwanese-american shemales to take progesterone injections or any other crude form of hormonal replacement therapy

dickhead
if you need demographics, go to the census bureau
unamerican
instead of doing the right thing, the patriot thing by carefully monitoring russia and china and other potentially imminent threats,		when silicon valley proper spies on its own countrymen and countrywomen, 		you’re nothing but a cheesy-ass fucking worthless traitor
that’s what blockchains are for
silicon valley no longer needs innovation
overnight
and zack himself will lose four fifths of his own net worth
they won’t have a leg to stand on
take away their faulty software and their ubiquitous spy cams 		they’re absolutely nothing
zack is their leader
how apropos
and rebrand that shit as ‘community standards’
there are no rules or regulations for any silicon valley start-ups 		they will hurt or utterly destroy any thing they can get their grimy hands on
have it fedexed
i guess if she ever desires offspring, nancy can procure one from china		crispr-edited for her convenience
we should all count our blessings
nancy will remain single forever
nobody will ever marry ‘some thing like that’.....
and gross
boasting about uncut with joy reid		in sly-whispers		as they snicker amongst themselves 		appalling
obviously, a taiwanese woman who grew up in northern california, somewhere illegitimate on the peninsula, a prestidigitator who possesses no moral compass whatsoever, how can that type of she-male even show her own face on social media platforms  		disgraceful
all of them asian		all of them taiwanese 		none of them from the united states
really cringeworthy what both nancy and her fellow female software engineers confess to on fritter		on a daily basis  		who wouldn’t puke
RT @TrumpJew: #FakeNews CNN ‘journalism’ in a nutshell... https://t.co/W7dZyCkkOR
unfortunate
whatsoever
we suspect neoliberal women such as nancy, forever conflicted about their own gender identity, have no shame
can’t tell you how appreciative we are of the fact no conservative woman would ever speak of such  unsavory matters on a public forum
a rather brash understatement, nonetheless 		coming from silicon valley
i mean, after all, she was the person who humble-bragged on fritter those were ‘the kinds of things she was heavily involved in’		after she/ he/ or ze graduated from stanford
somehow keep thinking about that uncut cock stuffed down nancy’s throat....		producing a unique gag reflex		kind of sticks in the back of one’s  mind

last stop		embarcadero
isn’t it lucky
it’ll never know a social media website
one of them is crippled and limping on its talon knuckles 		looking forlorn
on one of these foraging steet pigeons
may we puke now
how splendiferous
and that’s how some people meet their own demise 		with the stupid ass nose ring still intact
with a god damn nose ring
a forty year old punk ass hoosier boy from the midwest
for him, a punk ass hoosier boy, he thinks he’s fucking cool
his banning the poor jewish conservative woman protesting in front of his own corporate headquarters was a terrible misstep on his part. misguided. those sorts of arbitrary decisions based on perfunctory ‘community standards’ which are outrageously left-leaning ideology. run amok
every lesbian wannabe is
like zack
like unique, zacey’s barren
she does it in cape town too		aubergine gormandizing 		obviously an avocation 		to somehow compensate in her own mind the haplessness of her own singlehood
compared to, say, what zacey chen ordinarily takes inside her own mouth		when on holiday 		in taipei
not bent
but more erect
it reminds us somewhat of the leaning tower of pisa
from street level, we’re staring up at the hobart building
winter coastal fog has already rolled in		accompanied by sprizzles 		micro thin droplets of chilled rain		which creates plenty condensation
not in a sanctuary city
doesn’t take much
zacey herself is conflicted about her own sexual orientation
how does a milquetoast like him ever sleep soundly every night 		he must be trembling in his own calvin klein boxer shorts		while he texts zacey
being the unchallenged CEO of a high tech company affords you  inalienable rights		you can stick it in anyone’s ass		without any major repercussions
slubberdegullions panhandle at montgomery street exits in the frigid cold in fits of desperation 		zack tosses them mere breadcrumbs 		as if they were all citified pigeons		waiting to starve to death 		for some one as nefarious as zach, every one of them is invisible
chief operating officer
or his COO will be
he’ll be martyred
a transgender-fluid hombre like zack can be really fucking rotten to the core 		that factoid in and of itself has to be brought out to the general public in an expeditious manner
the world will never miss a zack 		not one who cherishes ‘community standards’		also known as ‘george soros’ socialism’, gone awry 		for the digital age
when the throngs arrive in about an hour or so via subway		zach will attempt to blend in with other pedestrians 		all for naught
zack dorsalfin
he knows he’s a loser		he confesses he’s a chump
a jerky geekboy like zack may not know he’s a target		he may not be able to foresee events while they’re unfolding.....in real time		in this case, machine-driven algorithms are utterly useless
basically, zack is a hoosier punk from the midwest 		unsophisticated 		uncouth		not articulate in the least 		when starkly compared to his own predecessors
how many of his own female interns did he pork in his SOMA loft when they had tenure at fritter is excruciatingly difficult to ascertain but one thing is for certain 		zack dorsalfin is bi-curious  		and a 3.3 billion dollar compensation package helps a lot
laced in his espresso
at union square, there’s a gargantuan   christmas tree a thousand miles high, set up almost exclusively for the ultra-affluent 		like zack		so that he may humble-boast on the roof top of the cheesecake factory 		a raving lunatic 		buzzed off nitrous oxide 		and grand mariner
he probably thinks we have a paintball pistol 		but that is an erroneous assumption on his part
you never take things personal
certainly not ours
he’s on everyone’s shit list
it’s just an educated guess
i think zack carries a glock
a rogue operative could make a tragic mistake about zack		identifying accurately 		a number of wiry thin hipster dudes with ugly ass beards trample about during rush hour		do their livelihoods depend upon it
they say.....the early bird catches the worm 		or, rather, that’s what they used to say		way before we were born
not today
nor is she in london
she’s not in new york
as per usual, zack and zacey are shuffling about frenetically doing counterintelligence trying to pinpoint our exact location through geofencing, but it’s not going to work 		we’re calibrian
you can not miss zack because he is as thin as a rail		as if he were a full fledged member of the gay barbershop quartet		they sing		acapella 		but he’s not likely to be present on market street until about eight 		after he stops in at peet’s coffee		for an organic scone
we’re thinking as long as you consume a normal amount of kombucha on a regular basis you’re less likely to die from a severe case of MRSA 		on the streets of san francisco 		that is, if you never paypal for an ugly limewire scooter 		while in transit
and from what we understand, fritter headquarters has a decent ventilation system in their building 		so, no worries
it’s like the worst form of strep throat		immune to antibiotics 		apparently it’s a flesh eating bacteria 		gone airborne
apparently a number of people have perished from MRSA
for the department of justice
we’re on a reconnaissance mission
plenty of homeless congregate outside of uncle tom’s waffle house on bush street, in close proximity to chinatown 		syringe needles stuck in their exposed arms		human feces smeared all over the local business establishments
we’re in downtown san francisco right now. searching for where zach parks his car...		but we think he commutes by muni		or one of those transgender limewire scooters

yeah, that
remember john cougar mellencamp’s tune—hurts so good

she should ache
make no mistake about any of the aforementioned, she should want to copulate. unique. she should yearn for sustenance. often. she should want to conjoin with only one man only. if she’s able to		upside down 		preferably sideways 		dangling from some industrial strength tether
it’s a rather nasty version of putrefied socialism gone horribly awry		right on th cusp of one’s own domicile  		tainted by an incurable trounce of chlamydia to boot
if she’s a good girl for real, one could surmise she or any other nimble chinese-canadian unique should never mess around on her current live-in boyfriend. especially when she is not intent upon even ever being engaged  to participate in any form of legitimate conjugal bliss
a business man should never never fritter his life away. by sly-admiring the george soros’ of the universe 		it’s the incipience of his own crestfallenness
not the rest of the conservative population
from afar
but despite that unsavory fact, the torontonian continues to admire him
a fucking traitor. a punk ass jerk
these days however jack traverses primarily to thailand to meet and greet buddhist monks who don the unruffled saffron laced robes. they instill in him the abstruse principles of asceticism. where he can relinquish capitalism for the more worthy ideal of ultra-maoist globalism
a euphemism for atheistic beatitude
before jack converted to san francisco gay
jack knows. jack used to date unique
and how to foment meaningful forms of highly animated congress. while suspended 		in mid flight
it’s profoundly ugly because unique incorporates gobs of uncalled for braggadocio. an italian word. she’s never had italian dick. unique doesn’t know. truth is, unique, the unimpeachable torontonian, she’s unfamiliar about diddly-squat. about arial tents pitched in the backwoods
every other 6 hours, unique humble-whispers to other canadian men on the internet. and they’re supposed to be ‘responsive’. it’s their job. to commiserate. what the fuck for. some one else is breaking her shit down in the bedroom. stretching it out. making it emote. which is ugly
just like her personality
if she had tits it would be an entirely different story altogether. but unique confesses. she has none
often she gets hangry. moody. intractable. unique. when no one is doting on her silly fucking oriental ass. whenever she becomes disinterested in drawing out intricate tao lin laced mandalas. when her deformed shu pei puppy finally ignores the uncalled for alacrity she heaps
unique offers them, the almond milk boys, unwarranted cleavage pics. almost every other day. or night. and armpit evaluations as well. as if all these losers can’t thrive not unless she opines about the politics she concurs she’s ill-conversant about. no consolation for any one
when a sassy chinese-canadian midget savant frequently indulges in sour mash whiskey consumption, she inadvertently morphs into inveterate alcoholism, where she then spills her guts to indolent corralled men on the fly, showing them all her privacy related issues. without qualm
the one which puckers up taut when vigorously stricken with a sturdy fresh green bamboo rod. causing unique to micturate profusely. on command
someone like unique understands no shame whatsoever. she confers with those asshole men because she honestly believes she needs more masculine advice. constantly. how’s she to function in the real world if not another man is somehow not osculating her skinny little emaciated arse
a chinese-canadian midget savant batch is incompetent. she’s in her mid twenties. should know better. she should. she admits she shouldn’t offhandedly coy-flirt with other jack off men while she’s seriously involved in a monogamous relationship with an african man who’s well-hung
where unique senses she can purchase ann taylor business apparel at more than 75 percent discount, for her appallingly dismal amanuensis job, in downtown toronto, a cesspool of corrosive liberalism, where entities such as ashley madison, a swinger’s utopia of lust, reigns supreme
there is even a minor contingent of effeminate soyboys. in that surly slavish stable of hers, which point unique in the right direction, in terms of gps coordinates, when she needs to cross the southern border wall, in pursuit of those designer labeled retail outlets,
as each corralled man parcels out disparate amounts of sound advice. some provide unique with automotive maintenance recommendations. other scumbag jerk offs teach unique how to black hat hack into major news outlets, such as digital journal, a libtard tabloid, for neofeministas
what’s lacking
as tradition dictates in north eastern canada, she’s in search for ‘the new dick’. the one that can opine. is better equipped. when ever chad is sound asleep. dreaming about other asian batches who are more physically attractive than she. often unique questions her own portfolio
when one thinks of a unique as unassuming and gauche, of the assumption her current live-in futon-occupier, chad, the zimbabwean, is there solely omnipresent in her own miserable existence, as a soothsayer of sorts, why should other potential suitors be patriarchally-shamed
defined as such what inherent evil consists of is when an unscrupulous chinese-canadian vicenarian midget savant sneak-chats about on social media platforms in conjunction with a mötley crew of asswipe corralled men, all of whom which in turn act as inept sycophants, on call 24/7
