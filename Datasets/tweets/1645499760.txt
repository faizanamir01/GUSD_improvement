@krassenstein The whole world could in theory claim asylum (billions). Do you seriously believe that the United States can afford to take them all? Nope. Maybe they can *double tax* the democrats to pay for all asylum seekers.
@tedlieu @hughhewitt "Vastly more efficient to spend billions stopping the 9/10s of drugs that come through legal ports of entry"? They've tried that ever since the Reagan administration TED, it hasn't made a dent in drug trafficking.
@RepBetoORourke Nice speech, but if truth be told... the only people the far left welcomes with open arms into America are non-caucasians. Europeans? Those they despise.

@imipak @EdKrassen SCOTUS will likely send it back to the lower courts anyway.
@tedlieu @hughhewitt Do you really think that 90 percent of the narcotics come through legal ports of entry? What are you saying Ted, US border agents are incompetent?
@thehill Democrats keep saying the same old lines: it's a wall of hate, it's a vanity, it's a waste of money, it's a wall we don't need. Nothing even remotely true. New roads and bridges will cost trillions not a few billion.
@amjoyshow @AyannaPressley She's so far removed from truth she makes 'Reality Winner' a monument to the Democratic Party. It's not hate it's the 'unknown' danger that the wall keeps out.
@bimpou So you got 'Apu Scream' 😱by Edvard Munch there in the background? Nice touch.
@krassenstein Does Roger Stone speak Russian? Because if he does not, then chances are your theory is total bullshit. 🐂💩

@LaF3mm3Nikita @MalcolmNance @TheBeatWithAri Clearly Donald Trump is in debt to Russia for something? It's so clear in fact, that the muddy waters of potential extortion evidence don't show anything of importance.

@RepAdamSchiff Americans don't want droves of criminal migrants flooding across the border.

@ItsWhatsername Thousands of people overdosing on fentanyl smuggled across the New Mexico border is funny to you? The US Border security department doesn't even know who is coming into the US there, it's no man's land down there.
@TrumplerPhd @BigBoiCuster Did you photoshop that head onto the body? 🤨
@ItsWhatsername Mohamed Atta was a Coral Springs Resident too! Another GOOD reason to be wary of immigrants from the Middle East! That's why we need a wall to prevent them from coming through the southern border.
@ItsWhatsername Not all from Saudi Arabia. Mohamed Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta was an Egyptian hijacker and Islamic terrorist and one of the ringleaders of the September 11 attacks who served as the hijacker-pilot of American Airlines Flight 11.

@JaneRozales That's not the point, that money was from sanctions imposed to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Now they can use that to further their nuclear ambitions and funding terrorism. Nice going Obama. $150 billion in exchange assets to realize their nuclear ambitions and fund terrorism.
@tedlieu @DogginTrump @POTUS The money has already been allocated by Congress Ted, and the Democrats have already agreed to fund a border wall during past administrations.

@krassenstein That was Obama and his winning the heart and minds rule of war.
@tedlieu You're making it sound or appear acceptable to murder/kill indigenous Americans all because immigrants commit less crime, which of course is not acceptable.
@ThomTheProphet @tedlieu There is one fact that's undeniable, Americans are being murdered by undocumented criminals coming across the border. Nothing can lessen or mitigate that fact.
@TrumpAgitator @tedlieu Sounds like you're attempting to mitigate the tragedies of Americans and their family members getting murdered by people coming across the border.
@ThomTheProphet @tedlieu That's a value judgement on your part. The fact is that no one institution has exclusively studied crime all along the US - Mexican border. Immigrant is a broad brush, and includes many who are in fact not from Mexico or Central America.
@tedlieu Cato vice president for research Brink Lindsey agreed that libertarians and liberals should view each other as natural ideological allies. 👈🤨
@tedlieu In 2006, Markos Moulitsas of the Daily Kos proposed the term "Libertarian Democrat" to describe his particular liberal position, suggesting that libertarians should be allies of the Democratic Party.
@tedlieu That smacks of slanting, and an appeal to authority. Authorities in one field are not necessarily experts in another. The facts are that US citizens have died by undocumented migrants who keep coming back illegally to commit crimes.

@JadedCreative This Nazi sympathizer? Now that's rich.
@krassenstein Whatever happened to that diversity and inclusion?
@axidentaliberal Correction, the left wing democrats don't want a wall. Because it deprives them of newly minted votes from south of the border, and cheap labor for crops.
@KevasRobert What is the implication? A border fence goes up, and no one will even care or notice the difference where they live.
@grantstern @robreiner @funder Rob Reiner? The fat lady's husband?
@SpeakerPelosi Ha ha ha. You and @SenSchumer insist that @POTUS reopen the government before having a serious discussion on border security, but you and Chuck really intend on doing after that is slamming the door right in the President's face.

@thehill What like @SpeakerPelosi is expecting @POTUS to be at Mar-a-largo?
@SpeakerPelosi So, is that Gavel government issue?
@myserenity69 @SpeakerPelosi Are you accepting large wagers? 💰🤔
@chiaincharge @thehill That's 17 trips. You'll need to pull a freedom of information at the GAO to find out the average cost of one trip. Good luck with getting that information.
@veesharma07 @DonaghyRay @dcexaminer Congress has enacted a Presidential Succession Act on three occasions: 1792 (1 Stat. 239), 1886 (24 Stat. 1), and 1947 (61 Stat. 380). The 1947 Act was last revised in 2006.
@chiaincharge @thehill You claimed Each trip to Mar-a-lago costs US $3M which is bullshit. That report was for Obama's trip to Palm Beach.
@veesharma07 @DonaghyRay @dcexaminer That's not what the 1972 law covers. It specifically says "in the even both President and Vice President" perish or are removed at the same time.
@chiaincharge @thehill The GAO report in question, one of very few available estimates of the cost of presidential travel, did not say exactly that a trip to Mar-a-Lago cost $3.6 million. The report covered a specific trip Obama took in 2013 covering two cities including Palm Beach.
@chiaincharge @thehill Both presidents Obama &amp; Trump went to Palm Beach. The GAO report found that total air and boat support accounted for more than 85 percent of the $3.6 million spent on Obama’s 2013 trip.
@chiaincharge @thehill Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu on Hawaii. Like she couldn't have a vacation in Florida for a quarter of the cost, and be close enough to negotiate.
@chiaincharge @thehill The California Democrat's suite, a posh Hawaiian resort, which she has rented for the past two Christmases, goes for $10,000 a night. Plus the cost of the security detail to local taxpayers of $34,000.
@chiaincharge @thehill Well, sorry your feeble mind feels the need to debate with a lesser account.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer Presidential Succession Act 1792. Section 9 in the event of the removal, resignation, death, or inability of both the President and Vice President, the President pro tempore of the Senate was next after the Vice President, followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer Still don't get the Secretary of the Treasury over the Secretary of Defense. Makes little sense.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer IF Trump were to die in office, then that would make the speaker of the house 2nd in line after the Vice President. However, even if the President were to be removed from office the Vice President being President would chose another Vice President.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer That's why Bush used to call the speaker of the house 3rd.
@DonaghyRay @veesharma07 @dcexaminer No. The Speaker of the House is 3rd in line to be President. Pence is 2nd.
@TODAYshow @AviFlyGirl @SavannahGuthrie @NancyPelosi O'l Nancy has just shown her playing cards to @POTUS . She feels it's racist against latinos to have a border wall, nothing to do with cost, but she can live with the consequences of an occasional murder by undocumented migrants.
@veesharma07 @dcexaminer Second in line for Oval Office seat? Ah no, you might want to read up on American politics. She's actually 3rd in line.
@briantylercohen O'l Nancy has just shown her playing cards to @POTUS . She feels it's racist against latinos to have a border wall but she can live with the consequences of an occasional murder by undocumented migrants.
@funder Why? Because the democrats think building a border wall would a sign of racism against latinos. It has nothing to do with the overall cost.
@myserenity69 @joefaz @SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi just played her cards, it's no longer about the cost to build a border wall. Nancy and her entourage consider a border wall *racist* against latinos. She's anthropomorphizing a wall for crying out loud. #BuildThatWall
@madanboukman @OmowaleAfrika UN Peacekeepers? Who exactly is in charge of these supposed peacekeepers?
@funder @TheDailyEdge It's up to McConnell duh, and besides people voted for Trump based on his desire to build a restraining fence. You seem to feel they should have no say in the matter.
@Minervasbard @TrinityResists @B52Malmet Hacking voter machines? Please explain that one. Why would supposed 'gerrymandering' and voter roll (It's not a stage play) purges in predominantly black communities ( if it happen on purpose) concern you? How do you know they wouldn't vote republican?
@itsreallyalexb He’s on Russia’s payroll? Seriously, like Trump needs the money? 💰
@SpeakerPelosi @TeamPelosi just showed her 🎴hand about the 'real objection' to erecting a 🧱border fence/wall with @POTUS. It's no longer about the 💰money, it's really about the morality issue.
@NYGovCuomo Since you're set on decriminalizing cannabis, how about going all in and decriminalize sex workers? Talk about history. Legalizing prostitution like the Netherlands.

@TrinityResists @B52Malmet To provide housing, health, welfare, educational and employment facilities for our explosively expanding population is going to be a large enough task for even the richest of nations.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet What Kennedy clearly did not call for was a massive increase in the number of immigrants being admitted to the United States.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet In 1958 the ADL not only endorsed, but published Kennedy's calls for a more liberal US immigration policy. The immigration reforms Kennedy called for went well beyond their original intent and produced many unforeseen consequences.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet To this day, there is a strong feeling that, had it not been for the highly restrictive immigration policies of the US (and other countries), many of Europe's Jews could have been saved. That's the crux of immigration policy being forced today.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet Do some research for once in your life, and stop parroting the loony left.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet The mix of immigrants, legal and illegal, shifted dramatically in favor of Latin America and Asia – a fact that Kennedy, in later years, would attribute to illegal immigration.
@TrinityResists @B52Malmet It's pretty obvious ever since Ted Kennedy's immigration policies. Kennedy and the ADL-a division of B'nai Brith, the most prominent Jewish organization in the United States-found a commonality of interests.

@PoesLaw2 If the waiter in the puzzle openly pocketed a $2.00 tip that leaves $28.00. The waiter was given $30.00 by the guests, so giving them each $1.00 back leaves $25.00 from the total, but no one really knows what each individual meal actually cost. It should also be you and 2 frens.
@PoesLaw2 But he keeps $2.00 as tip, and gives back $1.00 each. That's $5.00, so if the total is $29.00, he must have pocketed just $1.00 to make $30.00
This just shows that the majority of Democrats aren't that progressive. 👈 https://t.co/Ax5yf8X1sV
@PoesLaw2 He pocketed $1.00, made each pay $9.00 instead of $10.00, while tipping himself $2.00. If you add the stolen $1.00, the total tip is $3.00, which would be a 10% tip.

@PoesLaw2 If you divide 25/3 you get $8.33 cents, so if you add the additional $3.00 bucks plus the $2.00 tip the total is $30.00. BTW that's a sexist puzzle, the waiter could in fact have been a female.

@TomPaine1737 @Arriadna @realDonaldTrump That phrase after the comma requires a coordinating conjunction or a subject. There are two separate thoughts in that statement.
@TomPaine1737 @Arriadna @realDonaldTrump It's painfully obvious you've never spoken with the many Americans who live in Tijuana and work in San Diego.
@TomPaine1737 @Arriadna @realDonaldTrump "You've already clearly shown that you don't know what you're talking about in this, care to get back to my original question"? There's a sentence fragment here. A prepositional phrase without a subject; right after the comma.
@alexcll @nytopinion It's called hypocrisy.
@TomPaine1737 @Arriadna @realDonaldTrump Most of the Americans who work in Tijuana live in San Diego? Ha ha LOL. They can't afford to live in or near San Diego, it's much cheaper to live in Tijuana.
@TomPaine1737 @Arriadna @realDonaldTrump 50,000 vehicles and 25,000 pedestrians enter the United States at the San Ysidro border crossing daily. So you think they can catch them all? Nope.

@BCreil @KevasRobert @BetsyGervasi You missed the whole point, no surprise. Sarah Papenheim was an American on foreign soil, not the other way around. There is zero concern from Congress, they're more worried about migrants on American soil.

@VoxChao @rieth_damon Roger Stone. Ha! Hey did you mourn for that 21 year old minnesota student who was knifed to death in the Netherlands while attending school, or does it have to be a migrant somewhere?

@Holmer_K @BetoORourke Sorry, their parents signed a document stating she was in good health. That's why the border agents didn't investigate sooner. End of story.

@Red5StandingBy9 @AynRandPaulRyan @rieth_damon Oh sorry, you mean those shit hole countries? Nice.

@Ocasio2018 @Redpainter1 There is a BRIDGE there you know.
@david_j_roth Ha. The human race as it relates to climate change is just a 'blip' in earth's history. Maybe not even a 'blip'

@freddyatton @realDonaldTrump There needs to be a radio button that says "don't fucking care"

@drvox @Mikel_Jollett That's right, make these statements sounds as inhumane as possible, in order to stir up sympathy for the democratic party in the next election.
@drvox @Mikel_Jollett More far left propaganda for the masses? Not a word when Europe or Israel does it on live television to quell insurrection.
@DogginTrump @freddyatton They do that in Europe and Israel all the time, and not a disparaging word from the liberal media.
@StormResist @freddyatton @axidentaliberal @ifindkarma @jomareewade @Augustus709 @HMAesq @EmmaFrostResist @jacksnowknows @SusanBChurch11 @TrisResists @TrinityResists This is most likely far left propaganda, who took that photo op?

@thedailybeast What was that thing POTUS said about countries outside the US?
@PoliticallyRYT @RodStryker Probably been smoking too many doobies.
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson They most certainly are in retrograde, displacing natives here or elsewhere would be unthinkable for them today.
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson That is nothing more than a utopian ideology pushed by the far left, machines can be made equal, humans as individuals can not be 'made equal' by policy.
Why is the progressive left today afflicted with cultural tribalism?
@ann_annasta @ReneeHoagenson There's only one conclusion here, and that is 'progressives' are in retrograde.
@JannaWilkinso69 Where's the General?

@WaveriderBlue @BreeNewsome It depends on what era you're referencing. Progressivism back in the 1800's was dedicated to invention and westward expansion. Progressivism in the modern era is "black power" everywhere in society nonsense.
