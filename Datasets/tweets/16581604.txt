It’s been nearly four years since a hate-filled man got his hands on a gun and took the lives of nine innocent Americans. Thank you to leaders in the House for finally taking steps to close the Charleston loophole. https://t.co/semkZn5sWn

Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for common sense gun reform like universal background checks. Today the House honored the will of the people, taking action where the Senate and WH have not, and showing us the power of citizens demanding change. https://t.co/HpPoIg57MY
Nevada has been a leader on critical issues that matter to Americans, like gun safety, thanks to leaders like @SenatorReid—great to catch up today and discuss progress. https://t.co/WtzSdkhRnV
Everywhere I go people tell me how important gun safety is to them — and it should be. Each day, 100 people who might have been saved by stronger gun laws lose their lives. Victories don't happen overnight, but we're making progress thanks to groups like @momsdemand &amp; @everytown. https://t.co/DCTBOJm83p
Thanks to President Ted Pappageorge and @Culinary226 of Nevada for a great conversation this morning and for sharing your perspectives on important issues your work touches every day —  immigration, health care, jobs, and the economy. Already looking forward to our next visit. https://t.co/PUr7Ah7ZNA
Air pollution is a threat to our environment &amp; public health, but we have a chance to take action, save millions of lives &amp; improve economies in the process. Countries can spur progress by making cities a part of the solution – India is just one example. https://t.co/x20jv1TGz5

Remember that when @realdonaldtrump’s own administration produced a report showing that we face “substantial damage to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health” from climate change, his response was: "I don’t see it."
This president’s rejection of science and reason is a danger to us all. The Pentagon and intel community believe climate change poses a threat to our security, and including a climate denier on a sham panel to undermine those reports won’t change reality. https://t.co/84kVoZRdnU
Building a wall won't solve our real challenges:	 	— Fighting climate change	— Ending senseless gun violence	— Creating jobs	— Making health care more affordable	— Stopping the opioid crisis	— Improving public schools &amp; making college more affordable	— Investing in infrastructure
Trump's decision to declare a national emergency over a crisis that does not exist while ignoring other true national crises is a total failure of presidential leadership. It's a dangerous, cynical political game. https://t.co/2OMI6zwUmz
Congratulations to @GovSisolak and Nevada’s legislature on making gun safety background checks law. Nevada is the latest proof that the will of the American people will not be ignored when it comes to gun safety. https://t.co/uV1PjWBDDB https://t.co/KRLnqSPte4
Unilaterally declaring a national emergency to build a wall to appease Trump's political base is politics at its worst. Diverting money away from areas where it's needed is government at its worst. This is no way to run a country.

While the president sounds the alarm about a wall we don’t need, he ignores real challenges like climate change and gun violence — which claims 100 lives a day inside our borders. We won’t be distracted from finding solutions. #SOTU
American greatness began with immigrants. Choosing greatness starts with understanding that. And it means choosing real solutions to our broken immigration system over gimmicks like a wall.
In 2016 @BloombergDotOrg launched the American Talent Initiative because we believed we could do more to increase college access regardless of income. Today that network has grown to 100+ schools making a difference for students who, like me, never expected to go to a top college https://t.co/jolY8w7jn1
Ralph Northam has been a good Governor and champion for gun safety, but in light of this racist and deeply offensive yearbook photo he can no longer lead Virginia effectively. For the good of the state he should resign and step aside.
The science is clear: Climate change makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense. Americans are seeing this first hand from wildfires to hurricanes to the #PolarVortex in the Midwest. We need a climate champion in the WH who can lead us forward. https://t.co/duIPO1nVtB
Manufacturing is a vital source of middle class jobs in New Hampshire &amp; across the country, but the President's trade war is driving up factory costs &amp; making it harder for companies to hire and grow.
