Si la brecha salarial continua a su paso, mujeres no alcanzaran igualdad salarial hasta el año 2059. El Congreso debe actuar. #EqualPayDay
Women won’t see pay equity with men until 2059 based on the rate the pay gap has been closing since 1960. Congress must act! #EqualPayDay
La mujer Latina gana solo un promedio de 55 centavos por cada dólar que gana un hombre. #EqualPayDay
Since the tragedy at Sandy Hook, there have been more than 100,000 gun deaths in the US. Congress’s inaction is inexcusable. #NotOneMore
Latinas working full-time, year-round on average still earn only 55 cents for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men. #EqualPayDay
Una mujer afroamericana sigue ganando solo 60 centavos por cada dólar que gana un hombre. #EqualPayDay
African American women working full-time, yr-round on avg earn only 60cents for every dollar earned by white non-Hispanic men. #EqualPayDay

¿Sabías que la brecha salarial es aún peor para la mujer de color? Durante #EqualPayDay, nos comprometimos al mismo pago x el mismo trabajo.
Did you know that the pay gap is worse for women of color in America? This #EqualPayDay, we recommit to #equalpay for equal work!
Thank you @RideOnTeam26 for making Congress listen. We need commonsense reforms to prevent gun violence, and we need them now. #NotOneMore
Cada miembro de los @HouseDemocrats es copatrocinador del proyecto de ley de un pago justo. #EqualPayDay

¡Cuando la mujer sobresale, el país sobresale! Durante #EqualPayDay, nos comprometimos a terminar la disparidad en el pago.
When #womensucceed, America succeeds! This #EqualPayDay, let's recommit to ending pay disparity once &amp; for all.

At White House for #HCR signing. The promise of our great country will finally show in its HC system and to 32mil Americans in the shadows.
History demanded we do the right thing and I’m happy we did. 10 ways the #HCR bill will help you now: http://bit.ly/ciVNzY
Voting soon on #HCR. History calls & rarely do we face choices like these. The cost of inaction is too great; the time to unite is now.
Today we will finally fix a broken health insurance system. #HCR is not about politics, it is a matter of justice and basic human decency
To echo my President: We can do what's right, what's hard. The need is great, the opportunity is here & the time for reform is now. #HCR
My friend Secy. of Ed Arne Duncan spoke at today's Approps hearing. Glad we share a vision of a national dialogue on educational equity.
