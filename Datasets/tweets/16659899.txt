@SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @typewriteralley @Reuvencarlyle Agreed, it was more a passive-aggressive gaslighting. If you support a particular bill, then you support global warming and want to undermine transit.
@typewriteralley @SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Maybe it’s because those same advocates focus all their efforts on attacking the handful who support transit instead of the vast majority who aren’t helping? But feel free to continue attacking your friends and hoping for a better outcome! 👍👍
@SeattleSubway @typewriteralley @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Diverting a tax that doesn’t exist? Please continue the circular firing squad, shooting at the few transit advocates we have. The oil industry loves it when we destroy each other in an ideological battle for who is most pure... 🤦‍♂️
@typewriteralley @SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle That argument is not credible. I support using carbon revenues for emissions reduction and I support more transit funding. But we shouldn’t rely on silly arguments with no basis in reality.
Rather than duplicate service, anyone who needs to get from the Mukilteo Ferry to Boeing should take Everett Transit route 70! The schedule looks perfectly designed to get commuters to work and back. https://t.co/Nk7o9bO5Ew
@SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Well then maybe direct the comment at them? Senate Dems are focused on expanding transit!
@SeattleSubway @SenatorPalumbo @Reuvencarlyle Fair criticism. But how does that translate to undermining transit? We are adding thousands of hours of service in Snohomish Co, don’t see why fixing the US-2 trestle undermines that?
Just picking up on this thread, but how have Senate Dems undermined transit? We can always do better on climate, and I’m glad @SenatorPalumbo and @Reuvencarlyle are pushing for bold action this year. https://t.co/exSzeQcep0

I also have a job that’s not ideal for carpooling, so I hear ya. But the HOV lanes ensure that  public transit works and moves thousands on buses at rush hour. Plus it encourages those who can carpool to do it! https://t.co/yCHqKdJ27r
Wrong. Voters approved the tax rates &amp; system plan. Voters are smarter than transit-haters give them credit for. We knew our region needed light rail, that’s why we voted yes.

Details on housing:	1️⃣ ⬆️ housing near transit	2️⃣ 🚫 regulatory obstacles to low-barrier housing	3️⃣ Massive ⬆️ in Housing Trust Fund	4️⃣ ⬆️ tax credits for preserving &amp; expanding #affordablehousing	5️⃣ Reform condo liability to create more paths to ownership
More details on #childcare:	1️⃣ Build on @RepReeves work group, bring business and child care providers together to find solutions	2️⃣ Ensure that no family pays &gt;10% of income on #childcare through tax credits &amp; subsidies	3️⃣ Pay for it by closing loophole on #capitalgains
More details on #healthcare:	1️⃣ Congress must pass #MedicareForAll 	2️⃣ In the meantime, let’s expand access to state health insurance through a #publicoption 	3️⃣ Mandate prescription drug transparency	4️⃣ Pass state-level protections that enshrine #ACA in state law
This must be issue 1️⃣ for anyone running for office. My solutions?

@JToddWelch If you’re arguing that the President isn’t racist, you’re part of the problem in this country.
@JToddWelch The 19yo who perpetrated the Mukilteo shooting in 2016, he should never have been able to legally purchase it. Bottom line: the 2nd Amendment says nothing about arming teenagers with military style weapons. #GunReformNow
@JToddWelch Also, I take it as progress that you didn’t take issue with the #ClimateCrisis and #studentdebtcrisis! You usually troll everything I say, so glad to see we’ve found agreement on *something* 👍👍
@JToddWelch Which institutions have racism? Well, let’s start with the #WhiteHouse, for example the current occupant referring to people of color as dogs. What gun violence? Lots of examples, but the shooting at #MarjoryStonemanDouglas comes to mind. Changes? No assault weapon sales to kids.

@walkerorenstein @cyrushabib @EmilyRandallWA Helpful clarification, thanks! I do still think the timing of his apology is politically motivated.

@cgpapworth @SenMarkoLiias The funding problem you’ve been hearing about is related to a decision by our state Supreme Court that said the state needs to provide more funding as promised in a law passed in 2008.

@cgpapworth @SenMarkoLiias Good questions! The lottery does generate millions for education ($126.8 million in 2017), which is a big deal! But our total state budget for education is $12.4 billion, so the lottery makes up ~1% of that. The other 99% comes from other sources like sales and property tax 1/3

@Schneider4House We have laws to protect against incitement in WA already, but I’m not a lawyer so couldn’t compare/contrast existing law to the example you cite. https://t.co/z3c5ui7lix
@Schneider4House It doesn’t protect dangerous speech, incitement, crying fire in a crowded theater, etc. But it does protect speech that is scandalous, uncomfortable, rude, comedic... And it emphatically protects speech that questions power.
Just FYI: We don’t really need the First Amendment to protect popular speech. #whcd2018 #SundayThoughts

@TheOlyOne @Starbucks Those of us with privilege need to use it to ask tough questions and demand change! Thankfully someone had the wisdom to video the scene and spotlight the injustice.

I’ve had hour-long meetings at @Starbucks where I never ordered anything, wasn’t arrested. I’ve used the bathroom without ordering anything, never arrested. I look forward to hearing the proactive things that the company will do to ensure that this never happens again.

@themasonhawk And for the kids who've been waiting for schools to be funded, I'm sad it's taken so long.
@themasonhawk I wouldn't be where I am without great Mukilteo schools, so making sure today's kids have the same chances I've had is my #1 priority!
@themasonhawk Thanks again for asking, we need everyone engaged on fully funding our schools!
@themasonhawk If the budget and education proposal invest significant funds to improve education, without making our tax system worse, I'll support them.
@themasonhawk I don't have the power to fully fund schools, but as a legislator, I'll be voting on the budget and an education plan this week.
@themasonhawk Lawmakers don't actually vote on our own salaries, all done by an independent citizen commission. But appreciate the question!

Great news! In bipartisan vote, House approves estate tax bill to fund schools and protect family-owned businesses! Time for Senate to act.
WA estate tax starts @ 10% for estates over $2 mil. All money goes to education. Cutting it means less for schools, more for millionaires.
RT if you agree that #WALeg should choose schools and kids over a few millionaire estates.
WA voters reapproved the state estate tax in 2006, dedicated it to Education Legacy Trust Fund. 62% of voters said yes for schools and kids
WA voters created state estate tax the year I was born: 1981. Now, some want to cut taxes for the wealthy. I choose kids over millionaires.

@navyet_94f The voters approved the estate tax, the democratic process decided it.
@SchipperKeith @joefitzgibbon Talking to the public is my job. Typical Tea Party tactics: silence any opposition.
@SchipperKeith Trying avenge past grievances is no way to govern. We've got a million public school kids depending on us to pass a budget.
@SchipperKeith Tea Party Senate has been clear from day 1, our way or no way. That's no way to govern, we have to work together.
@navyet_94f The voters approved the estate tax to support education. Those funds are critical for schools.
@SchipperKeith Tea Party Senate's tactics were never an issue before because they were in the minority. Time for comprise, not ideology.

@chadlupkes Yes! Our state minimum wage is tied to inflation, so should the federal one.
31 states are at/below the fed min wage, raising the fed min wage means economic justice for those Americans trapped in red states! #p2

4.4 million Americans are paid at/below min wage, 63% are women. Raising the fed min wage is about economic justice & gender equity! #p2
Higher WA min wage = $3650 more for workers vs fed min wage & we have added 46k jobs in the last year. Time to raise the fed min wage! #p2
