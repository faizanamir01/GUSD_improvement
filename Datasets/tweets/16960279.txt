We have one body and one brain and they are connected and you can either feed it with bullshit and drama or you can take care of it the way you would something you love.
Ever since I started working out I have learned about confidence, about pushing myself harder than I would like, dedication, not quitting, focusing on you and not other people and so on. 		I didn't work out last week and was miserable. Doubts came back, shitty habits, depression
you don't want to conform to societal norms, you don't care about body image, you assume the gym is filled with people who will throw you into trash cans, etc.		Here's the thing! It's not about that. Or it doesn't have to be!
Some thoughts on working out from someone who failed high school gym class every year and then resented athletes throughout most of his 20's:		I know that lots of my sweet nerdier (used as a compliment) followers may loathe the idea of going to the gym...
Man did I love @hankgreen’s first book An Absolutely Remarkable Thing. It’s lovley and brilliant and funny and kinda important living in the time we are living in. Go buy it!
RT @davidsirota: Here are two headlines from this week https://t.co/Lu0iauqfsC
Listen to one of the most fascinating conversations I've had on the Jamie Kilstein podcast with my new friend @GreggHurwitz for free https://t.co/oCYJeXzNdJ if on android you can also look it up on Spotify and Stitcher.
Just saw an add that Tinder is looking for a VP of communications and am wondering how many resumes are just dick pics.
Can not state this enough: @guster is so fucking fun to see live. They were total rock stars and Ryan is funny as fuck. So glad we became pals and thanks for the show dude!! Go see them on this tour and get the new record.
@primalpoly CLEAR EYES FULL HEARTS CANT LOSE
Very excited to get back to jiujitsu. #bjj #jiujitsu #maniac? https://t.co/DkRpdqvBkT
Listening to @stephenfry interviews make me feel smarter. Is it his thoughts? Is it his charming accent? We will never know.
This is very true. https://t.co/VGoE8Wvcvs
@RhettReese My president.
Well now that I have looked at twitter I see it was an awkward day to make a random Taken Joke.
Final update: I fell asleep fully clothed at around 6pm and have just woken up.
@TheProductDS This is the bravest thing you have written and I salute you for it
I am eating ritz crackers while waiting for the pizza.
@ThatOneGirl626 welp
I have watched 2 episodes of Im sorry, order pizza, ate pasta, forgot if the superbowl has started already.
Update I have taken the edible and do not want to watch the Super Bowl. Figuring out how to play this. #superedibowl
@HighwalkerMMA I think I’m surprised at how bad the writing was not the other stuff
@HighwalkerMMA holy shit
@GreggHurwitz hey Gregg you didn’t tell me your friend @jordanbpeterson played percussion in your other friend @guster’s band https://t.co/R9rJDwDtV9
I don’t know about the #SuperBowl. I also don’t want to make fun of the Super Bowl for people who enjoy it. I am however debating taking edibles and live tweeting what I think is happening during the Super Bowl. #superedibowl
Back! Back! Back!!! https://t.co/xiHcodfJWZ
Yo @henrymjamison is very good at music.

Time for my yearly “I don’t know about football so tell me which team I should cheer for based on which owner/players did the least awful things this year.”
Adding to my list of things I’ve fallen in love with today is the show I’m sorry by @andreasavage. So much good shit being made. Go support good shit.

@michaelshermer WHERE DOES MY CAT GO SHERMER?!
"My own kitchen was a black food desert and I'm hungry as fuck" - @KillerMike 		Yup. This is my new favorite show.
Ten minutes into trigger warning with @KillerMike and it's fucking incredible. Can't wait to see what's coming up.
I think I heard somewhere that you are supposed to eat an entire pizza and tin of garlic bread by yourself when you are sick if the whiskey didn't work the first night.
Sometimes I think I could avenge my slain family like The Punisher. Then other times I order delivery from down the street cause i'm cold and under my blankey and don't want to get up from watching The Punisher.
@mattstaggs @paulgallipeau unblocked! Don't be a dick :)	Thanks Staggs. You're a good dude.

@Simms2673 Hahaha we should have started this friendship decades ago
@Simms2673 also go watch season 2 episode one of punisher. Total old school great. And he fucks.
@Simms2673 listen to me. This tweet needs to be framed and inducted into some kind of Twitter hall of fame.
@Simms2673 yes yes yes! I feel the exact same way. Every fight I was SO invested in.
@Simms2673 yeah man! That's the thing. I LOVED all of Daredevil so much but really thought I would like punisher more. I think the character was just SO clear in DD it made the storytelling easy and the violence meaningful.
OK! I fucking love the pilot to season 2 (skipped the rest of season 1) I think what I love about the punisher is simplicity. 		Good man wants to stay good but his sense of right and wrong prevents him from staying out of trouble. 		Then VIOLENCE.
@CubbyCreative Yeah I already like season two better I’m just gonna skip the rest of season one and put this shit together. LIKE THE PUNISHER WOULD
@mandystadt @Cernovich @JohnAvlon Jesus I never saw these
I DONT WANT TO BE ALONE ON THIS!
OK. I need nerd help. 		Punisher was my favorite comic. 	I love the cast of Netflixs punisher. 	I love what Netflix did with Marvel properties. 	Why did I not get into the punisher? 	I feel crazy and want to love it. I'm debating just starting over again with season 2.

So remember, if you lose the girl, you still had someone who loved you. If you lose 5 pounds but have 30 to go, good keep going. Be realistic without being apathetic. But the most important thing is to go go go. Love you guys.
It's like if you are new to jiujitsu your goal shouldn't be "tap the black belt" it should be "get the shit kicked out of me a little less every day."
Remember if you are setting goals or making resolutions to appreciate the little victories. If your goals are just "lose weight" or "find love" those are easy to feel like you failed if you don't knock it out of the park right away.

Have a great holiday but remember the true meaning of Christmas. It’s the story of when Jesus jumped down from a heaven cloud to yell that abortion was bad and gay people should only have penis vagina sex and then got into a big fight with his dad who is Santa. Merry Christmas!
@ThatChrisRyan Jesus Christ
@BrandonCTE @AndrewCTE Guys. This is not ok. This holiday is about Jesus. Our savior. He came down to stop abortions and fight with his dad. This is the story of Christmas. I would appreciate you take time to meditate on this. Merry crisis.
