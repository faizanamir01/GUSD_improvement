@nhannahjones Don’t forget all the soliders who fought for democracy overseas and returned to a country where they could not vote or fully utilize the GI Bill that catapulted legions of white servicemen into comfortable middleclass status through education and low interest loans

The David Brooks endorsement of reparations reminds me of the moment — &amp; many women will relate to this — where something brilliant or cogent or necessary is said, but not heard or embraced, until someone else named Tim or Bob or David or Chris co-signs or echoes same thought

There is a syllabus for hatred in America. It may not be in textbooks, official lesson plans or coded in our standardized tests.  But is there. Taught and absorbed through. Modeling, practice, primacy, emphasis, demonstration, observation, repetition and reward.

3.  But mostly the village misses &amp; mourns the magic of seeing Gwen glow and glide through the throng of people crammed in her house. Relatives. Friends. Congregants. Coworkers. Kids. She loved when we showed up with our parents or a cherished fried.  No strangers rule in effect
2. Everyone in that village still has an internal GPS that instinctively wants to drive to Gwen’s. Our collards and our black eyed peas will never be quite the same. The laughter perhaps with a little bounce.  The lost thrill of wondering “who will I bump into this year”
1. There’s an Army of DC folk with a hole in their heart &amp; their calendar on New Years Day. For decades we all gathered at Gwen’s for food &amp; music &amp; non stop laughter.  Over time our hair got grayer. Our waistlines grew. So did our kids &amp; our allegiance to the village she created https://t.co/MpUcphtcFo

Grew up grooving hard to Rock Creek Park wondering what that place must be like.  Envisioned party’s and bbqs and speakers set up blaring from car trunks. Decades later I live a block from Rock Creek Park,  hike the trails on the weekends and drive thru the RCP roads every day
Smiling. Snapping.  Dancing and so digging this. On air with awesome daughter for her college radio show playing one of my all time fave grooves (and our DC good) — Rock Creek Park.   Join the party and listen now: https://t.co/H1P7O1GmeC https://t.co/kfsrcojlHA

Language counts. We need to find a replacement for "meddling". That word is too soft, too benign, too backed off from what should be in bright focus.  A nosy neighbor or co-worker perhaps meddles. You would reasonably reach for a stronger word if they were brandishing a weapon.

@ava That effort to balance the Broll at @abcnews also included effort to make sure brown people were represented in tape of people doing the things people do. Working, shopping, exercising, voting, vilunteering, caring for their kids, keeping up their homes,  being good citizens
@ava You could today add immigration to that list as stories on that topic leave impression that US inward migration is from Mexico and Central America
@ava Years ago when I worked at @ABC news a group of us systematically went thru the Broll to address stereotype reinforcement so when producers/reporters reached for tape of criminal activity, unemployment or poverty there wouldn’t always be a brown face
@ava This is a problem in newsrooms also. Broll footage used as filler in tv news segments reinforces image of scary, n’er do well, unemployed or underproductive brown/black people.  It becomes a steady drumbeat

And I assume  @netflix will reverse previous plans to remove @PartsUnknownCNN episodes as part of its regular rotation on June 16.  Perhaps they have already scuttled those plans. Hope so.  I think we all want to binge at that buffet
Whatever @CNN decides to do I hope every single person who worked on @PartsUnknownCNN knows that even though they work behind the scenes, they are SEEN and deeply appreciated and in our hearts right now. Thanks for adjusting our cultural compass
I mean c’mon. @Bourdain went to @Houston &amp; reportedly told his staff not to include white people &amp; instead focus on the city’s rich multiethnic stew - not to dismiss or disrespect majority culture but to use his platform to focus on overlooked stories in plain sight. Delicious
I know @Bourdain repeatedly said he wasn’t really a journalist. I am and so I respectfully contradict him. As a lawyer would say, all evidence to the contrary.  He was one of the best storytellers in this earth and that is why I wish @CNN would let his team share their/his story
The @PartsUnknownCNN producers, editors, fixers could talk about how he dealt with his addiction in Sicily and  by tracing his own tracks back to Provincetown.  The latter is one of the best examples of heart wide open journalism I have witnessed.
Plus....I would love to hear the stories @PartsUnknownCNN producers could tell about @Bourdain and his journeys.  The trip up the congo,  the ladies of Lagos, the emotional toll of sitting down with someone who lost legs to old grenades. Who found the mowing brigade in Detroit?
Hoping @CNN does another @Bourdain tribute but this time focused on his producers , camera crews &amp; fixers who created the episodes we all loved. They knew him best &amp; helped him navigate new worlds on our behalf. They deserve the respect &amp; platform to lift up his spirit

A guide for teaching or talking about the Tulsa Riots: https://t.co/8dvigul2Af
“Tulsans scarcely spoke of this traumatic event privately, let alone publicly. No one dared to address it through education—pedagogically. Textbooks omitted references to this ugly chapter in our history.”
Take time. Study the Tulsa Riots. Know what happend then and take time to lean about what’s happening now around truth and reconciliation. Perhaps a model for a nation that has a hard time looking squarely at its racist past and the vestiges that live on today. Take the time
People understood the real world scenario but it was more uncomfortable (of course it was) to talk about privilege and social expectations and the role it played in the obliteration of a thriving black Oklahoma community.  Roots. Tendrils. The long arm and hard fist of supremacy
I asked mixed race crowd if they understood the sentiment behind “First Class. I feel their discomfort”.  Had they been surprised to see someone they didn’t expect to see in 1st class. Had they been made to feel like outsider ??
I get those stories “risen above your station” stories at https://t.co/z2tapK4zxs and frankly have felt it myself in life
When I spoke at Greenwood center in Tulsa last night talked about a 6Words story “First Class. I feel their discomfort” I get stories like that from POC &amp; women who get “you don’t belong” vibe during 1st class travel as if they’ve risen above their station
The @JHF_Center is trying to move their city (and the country forward) and is this week studying the DNA of reconciliation. What will it take and even will it take.  I respect their efforts. We all should know and respect this history
A lot of residents (white) in Tulsa say its ancient history and note that statue of limitations has expired. Move on they say.  The @JHF_Center is trying to help city move THROUGH the history. Face it full on.  The history. The consequences, lost wealth and lingering resentments
And yet.... one of Tulsa’s most famous residents John Hope Franklin led the city toward truth and reconciliation.  A park in his name — JHF Reconciliation Park is a place that through massive story boards and carefully programming forces the city to remember and face hard truths
Greenwood never fully recovered and the wound is still open.  Still fresh.  Still throbbing.  And yet.....
Many descendants of that tragedy— the vengeful mob &amp; the black victims —   Live and work in Tulsa &amp; drive past each other on the way to work each day in a city where housing patterns are still segregated
Thousand were left homeless and sent to live in internment camps. Their insurance claims denied. Many of the dead were buried in unnarked pauper graves (though they lived in a prosperous black community) https://t.co/5xwZImykbu

I will amend an earlier statement I made and doing so does my heart good. The @ABCNetwork and parent company @Disney did NOT turn a blind eye toward bigotry. Instead they demonstrated what a strong moral compass can and should do.
...and dear headline writers, when someone refers to a black person as an ape it is not an "offensive comment" I'm careful about tossing around the term "racist" but that is exactly the word you need to reach for right now. Grab it by both hands and tell it like it is
That alleged apology from @therealroseanne to @ValerieJarrett  is not enough. Not nearly enough. Not even close. The silence from @ABCNetwork and @Disney is shameful and supine...turning a blind eye to bigotry in the pursuit of ratings gold.

If you have a veteran in your family, interview them about their service and their story. Record it. Cherish it. Add to our collective history with their tales so often missing from the official records
We need more attention &amp; scholarship &amp;  understanding of the complicated history of America’s black veterans. One place to start is the lost wealth for all those who were not able to exercise full access to GI Bill or veteran’s benefits.  Major contributor to current wealth gap
@DeltaDiva_DoIt Right back at you
I love the @HonorFlightDCA program and ppl might say “there she goes again talking about race” but I feel a special swell in my heart when I see a Black WWII, Vietnam or Korean War vet. Ive done the research. I know they faced bullets in war and deep bias at home and the ranks
Black veterans like my father  were so marginalized and mistreated in WWII.  I wish the world rose up to honor more of them for a special kind service. Fighting for a country that you love - even when that country doesn’t love you back.  A special brand of patriotism
I am flying home to Minneapolis today and so I am thinking of my Pops and wishing he could have done something like this..... come to DC to see the monuments raised in honor of his service, greeted by applause and confetti and manifest gratitude
I fly a lot out of Reagan National Airport so I’v see the @HonorFlightDCA arrivals often over the past decade. It used to be mostly WWII vets, now more from Vietnam and Korea and more women too.  Blessings to all who run and volunteer for this program https://t.co/kesVjgshcW
At a moment when America &amp; especially DC is so divided - to see a spontaneous and unanimous display of honor &amp; gratitude felt like balm.  Sentimental perhaps, but not hokey or saccharine. Manufactured yes, but to give those vets their due.  And those vets. Aging. Emotional. Proud https://t.co/SfzBWI0vvR
The @HonorFlightDCA ceremony is like a spontaneous parade breaking out in an airport       Everyone stands and claps for the vets as they roll, walk, or are wheeled through the corridor with a band playing John Phillip Sousa tunes. https://t.co/nhUU47NYBY

@samsanders I also remember going south for Easter where we could shop for clothes but could not use the dressing rooms in Birmingham. Perhaps another reason my mother kept her money and made our Easter finery
@samsanders Sam, I remember the yr the entire family wore orange &amp; white. All of us. Mom made our dresses &amp; hers. It was the 70’s so a man in an orange shirt w/ east coast- west coast collar under a white jacket was not unusual. Amazingly I had orange patent leather shoes. Family strong

@aaronemyers @AspenInstitute One of the things I remember so clearly from that book talk is the gasp in the audience when @ericaadunbar deflates the myth that George Washington had wooden teeth.  She explained that his dentures were made with the teeth of slaves. Takes my breath away again even to write this
@aaronemyers @AspenInstitute All that “never could tell a lie” stuff goes out the window with this book.
@aaronemyers @AspenInstitute Jaw dropping is right. Every time I recommend this book the reader eventually calls me to say they are stunned by what they learn about the first First Family and the lengths they took to maintain their hold on slavery
@aaronemyers @AspenInstitute Thanks Aaron Myers for the signal boost. “Never Caught” is a fantastic read and I look forward to seeing this @ericaadunbar book turned into a film.

@eyderp @alyssaedes Yes and yes. and yet I know from spending time on the ground and spending 8yrs listening to ppl talk candidly  abt this that a lot of families did shed or downshift aspects of their culture in a quest to become more “ideally American”.  No single narrative

@eyderp @alyssaedes Conversely, older people descended from European immigrants there talk about how “becoming fully American” was paramount in their families.  Old world customs were still embraced but assimilation was seen as the cost of entry to idealized White American status
@eyderp @alyssaedes It is interesting to listen to the younger people there talk about assimilation on their own terms. They absolutely embrace English and often help parents master the language but they do not want to completely shed their language, culture &amp; customs in the rush to embrace America

The details: Years later the land where that Weeping Time Slave Sale took place, the former race track, is covered partly by  industrial site....and .... an elementary school and playground https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The wife of the man who sold all those enslaved men, women and children wrote a blistering exposé of plantation slavery and mentioned many of the slaves sold in 1859” Thar and Doesticks’ work fueled abolition efforts https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
More details: “Butler (enslaved)descendants can be found in Savannah, Charleston, Memphis and New Orleans, where the Butler slave sale was advertised, and in smaller nearby towns. Narratives of the "Weeping Time" have persisted among some African Americans of Georgia Low Country” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
More details:”After the Civil War, some Butler slaves returned to the plantations where they had been born or raised, where they felt most connected, in search of friends and families. Descendants of Butler slaves still live in Darien, Brunswick, St. Simons Island, and vicinitys” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
This is an example of how Journalism matters.  “Detailing the callousness &amp; heartlessness of slavery, Doesticks' published exposé was a political blow to the South, at a time of escalating sectional animosity. The slave sale exacerbated tensions Bren northern and southern states” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details: “The heavens seemed to weep in empathy as the four dry days during which buyers inspected the enslaved gave way to a brooding storm; it rained "violently," and the "wind howled" for the two days of sale, letting up only after the last person had been sold” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details: “Weeping Time" brought much anguish to the enslaved. Families, who had been together for all their lives on Butler's Island or Hampton, were torn apart and dispersed; many of them never saw each other again. The Butler slaves were dispersed all over southern states” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details: “Pretend-buyer Doesticks (the journalist) recorded the facts of the sale, and his observations of the emotional impact on the men, women, and children (including thirty babies), who were sold for a sum of $303,850” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details: “Some stood stoically, resignedly, attempting to keep their dignity, while buyers poked, pinched, and fondled them, looked into their mouths, insisted they bend over or extend limbs, and searched for 'ruptures' or 'defects' that might affect future productivity.” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details: “After four days of prodding and inspection by prospective buyers, the slaves suffered through the two-day sale.” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details: “For several days before the sale every hotel in Savannah was crowded with negro speculators from North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, who had been attracted hither by the prospects of making good bargains.” https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
The details of this sale — the failure of a plantation, the examination of the enslaved, they way they are housed in horse pens, the tearing apart of families. All legal. All sanctioned. All part of American culture as abolition forces grew https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
That auction of 436 men, women and children to satisfy debts took place at a Savannah race track. Here’s what happened to that land. https://t.co/YJrIa3ugfb https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
Important and forgotten moment in US history. Worth reading O K Philander Doesticks article about “The Weeping Time” slave auction. The journalist (that’s his pen name)  went undercover and wrote about it in a way that will shatter your soul today. 		https://t.co/9oTvpn5Cqf https://t.co/Bw78xVOKzi
