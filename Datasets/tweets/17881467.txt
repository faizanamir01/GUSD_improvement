Cory Booker makes the case that he has the toughness to take on Trump: “When I get on the field, I strap on my chin strap and go hard. ...	I’m confident in my strength, I’m confident in my toughness. ...Whatever he wants to throw at me, bring it, because I’m ready.”
Her verdict: “That’s pretty convincing.”
Woman in Marshalltown asks Booker what differentiates him from other candidates. “I had to run something. I’ve had to stand in the saddle and make difficult difficult decisions...	I’m a get things done guy. I’m a mayor who became a senator but still believes in fixing problems.”
Cory Booker on Kellyanne Conway, who said he “sounds like a Hallmark card”: “I’ve had a life purpose long before she had an opinion.”

Booker was up past 2a and hit his first event a little after 9a. That is brutal 😵 https://t.co/lNu7osSsBs
Booker defends against Green New Deal critics who say its goals are impractical - saying, with that thinking, we never would have gone to the moon. “We need to be bold again in America ... do things people say are impossible.”
Booker getting a warm reception in Q&amp;A format, but every A is basically a mini speech. He gets a Q about the Founders - who’s most genius, and most imperfect? Soon he’s talking about Trump’s inauguration, health care, the Muslim ban - and five min in hasn’t begun to answer the Q!
A uniquely Cory Booker moment: In the middle of a question on farms, Booker walks up to the man and takes his phone. “Keep talking,” Booker says. “What’s your wife’s name?” Booker proceeds to film a selfie message with the man for his wife. And then lets him finish his question.
Cory Booker is making his first Iowa stop since announcing his presidential campaign, in Mason City, and he’s already forgotten what day it is. “It’s great to be here on a Saturday morning...” Crowd corrects him. “I can see you all will be sticklers for detail!”

Here's a link to Booker's interview starting at the relationship question, because everyone seems very interested in this https://t.co/md5f9QVD75 (31:04)
Asked whether being unmarried should factor into electability, Booker says. “If Donald Trump can get elected with the personal life that he has? Then anybody can.” But adds, laughing: “There’s two more years. Give me some time.”
And for the first time (as far as I know), Booker addressed his current relationship status, confirming he has a girlfriend. “Before I declared for president, I’ve been dating somebody really special. (Would she make a nice first lady?) “Yes she would.”
Booker addresses Northam again: “You can’t disrespect entire swaths of this country and think that you deserve to lead.”
Responding to Trump saying he doesn’t have a chance in 2020, Booker says: “There is not a person who's listening to my voice right now who has not been underestimated, put down, doubted, and overcome anyway. And so this is what Donald Trump is. He doubts, he demeans, he degrades”
Asked about his relationships with his primary rivals, Booker says Elizabeth Warren called him after his campaign launch. Doesn’t get into details

Cory Booker has identified an initial slate of Iowa hires pending a public announcement about his 2020 plans. Michael Frosolone, Joe O’Hern, Haley Hager and Tess Seger all expected to join the Booker team, per source. (Des Moines Reg first reported on Hager/Seger.)

On the way to Columbia SC, Bernie was on my flight. On the way home, Cory Booker is on board. 		(Man across the aisle from him: “Are you Cory Booker?” Followed by an excited selfie.)
Booker added: "I think we need leaders that understand that we have to...lead with love. So, yesterday I had the day with John Lewis and Jimmy Carter… two moral giants in America who represent decency and really resonate to me what I want my message to be in leadership."
I thought this was really interesting and asked Booker, after he met with Jimmy Carter this weekend, whether he sees similarities between 1976 and 2020.  He said: "I think that this is a moment in America that calls for moral voices." Which I think is a yes? https://t.co/CzPVIMTVFF
Booker also talked about meeting with President Carter over the weekend, saying it “blew me away that (he) would encourage me to run for president.” 		“I’m not that far from making a decision myself,” Booker added.
Asked what he thinks of Kamala Harris announcing her candidacy on MLK Day, Cory Booker was uncharacteristically succinct: “Kamala is a dear friend of mine, and I wish her well.”
We asked Rep. Jim Clyburn what he thinks of Kamala Harris announcing her candidacy on MLK Day. “Well, I think that’s a pretty good symbol,” he said. “But everybody will wait to see exactly how the substance will square with the symbolism.”
Cory Booker did not mention Trump in his remarks at SC MLK Event. Bernie Sanders taking a different tack - saying Trump is “a racist.”
Speaking in South Carolina at MLK event, Cory Booker clearly identifying with the African American community here, referring to the crowd as “my brothers and sisters.” 		“We stand on the shoulders of OUR ancestors.”

@1SpencerGarrett Too soon?
Spotted on my flight to Columbia SC: Bernie Sanders. He’ll be speaking at an MLK Day event at the State Capitol tomorrow, along with Cory Booker. Primary season is here, folks!
Back on the road with John Lewis, Cory Booker says he’s been “rereading many of (Martin Luther King Jr)’s speeches as I think about the next stage of my life.” (A presidential campaign, perhaps...)
Booker thanked Carter, adding, “Your encouragement means more to me than you can imagine.”
Cory Booker and John Lewis attended a church service this morning led by former President Jimmy Carter. Afterward, Carter told Booker on his Insta story: “I hope you run for president.” https://t.co/66Of30CpYE

“Joe Biden knows more than most anyone about the nuts-and-bolts of running for president. What he knows less about is how to win.” https://t.co/x6GBB7JHBc
Booker said he hasn’t made a 2020 decision but has been “really encouraged” by response: “We need a revival of civic grace. We need people whose message is not going to be about what we're against but what our common values are. And so I'm encouraged that that message resonates.”
Booker: “The kind of charges that many people are talking about hold serious consequences for anybody, whether you're president of the United States or a citizen. ...No one is above the law. Donald Trump is not above the law.”
Cory Booker responding to BuzzFeed report said it “underlines even further why the Mueller investigation needs to continue,” but stopped short of saying the revelations would be grounds for impeachment if true.
Maybe not intentional, but Cory Booker just struck a contrast with Beto’s WaPo interview. After running through some problems facing the country, Booker says, “The question isn’t talking about these problems ... the question is, what are we going to do about it?”
Richmond: “Cory has to make some really big decisions over the next couple of weeks ...I want you to give Cory the encouragement to make that decision.”
At an event in New Orleans with Cory Booker, Rep. Cedric Richmond just led local students in a chant: “Run Cory, run.”

Reminder as we watch #MOSen today: although MO was solid R in the past two presidentials, it’s still complicated. Roy Blunt held on by &lt;3 in 2016. Many voters here are too ornery to be straight partisans and demand a lot of their candidates. 		So...it’ll probably be close.

@elwasson Based on a new Dem poll... I certainly think the margin will be much smaller than what we’d expect in this district. And an upset is possible! Scholten has run a great campaign and King hasn’t put in effort. Still, it’s tough.
This isn’t really an issue of the NRCC cutting off King. His district is solidly GOP and he hasn’t needed the party’s help (despite a spirited challenge from J.D. Scholten). If Republicans lose IA-04, they have much bigger problems. This is about sending a message.

If Democrats do get boxed out of the top two in a CA congressional district, it’s more unusual/interesting than meaningful - and likely wouldn’t tell us anything about the party’s chances in Nov. (Unless Dems ultimately fall short of taking back the House by just one seat!)
And, as an extension of the second question: what will Latino voter enthusiasm look like? That will be a key to Democrats winning the West in November.
It’s CA primary day. Storylines to watch: 		1) Will Dems get boxed out of the top two in one or more district? Or does the DCCC’s thumb-on-the-scale strategy pay off? 		2) Blue Wave watch: Does the Dem voter enthusiasm we’ve seen elsewhere this cycle manifest itself in CA?

Marie Newman concedes in IL-03: “After reviewing the results, we know that we lost by a thin margin,” she says in a statement. She will not hold a news conference this morning as she announced last night.

RNC response to Jeff Flake’s water-testing: “President Trump won because of his vision to make America great again, and we’re confident that as he continues to deliver on the promises he made, voters will re-elect him in 2020.”
We’ve heard this from Flake before - he hasn’t been shy about taking on the president. But his anti-Trump message takes on new meaning in New Hampshire, as does his openness to mounting such a challenge.
First question from the audience for Flake: Will you run for president? 		Flake says he does hope some Republican will challenge Trump. “I don’t know who it will be. ...But I’ve not ruled it out.”
2020 GOP primary watch: Jeff Flake in New Hampshire sharply and directly criticizes President Trump, says “there will have to be an American restoration.” 		He received a standing ovation.

One DCCC takeaway from PA-18: Lamb "fit the district," per memo to reporters. 		"There are dozens of Democratic candidates like Conor Lamb – with deep records of service that take them outside the partisan frame."
NRCC Chairman Stivers tells Republican members in closed-door meeting: PA-18 “is a wake up call. If you're getting outraised, this is a wake up call. Prepare to bear down."
Not on the agenda: rethinking GOP's anti-Pelosi, pro-tax reform messaging strategy. Republicans still believe it can work, even though it didn't give Saccone an edge. https://t.co/1IR5nE9eim
In a closed meeting today with Republicans, we expect NRCC chairman Steve Stivers to emphasize that "candidates and campaigns matter" in light of PA-18. Message to members will be all about fundamentals: raising money, defining yourself and your opponent.

@CHueyBurns This is the best compliment! Thank you 🤗
State Reps. Marsha Haefner and Kathie Conway issued separate statements this morning urging Greitens to resign. 		Greitens “is no longer fit to hold Missouri’s highest office,” Haefner said, adding that he “no longer has the trust and support of many in the legislature.”
In recent days, embattled Gov. Eric Greitens called MO state lawmakers and apologized - hoping to stop the bleeding after allegations that he blackmailed a former mistress. 		No dice. Already today, two state GOP lawmakers, both women, are urging Greitens to step down.
