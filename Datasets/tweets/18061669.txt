The funding package also invests in the Arctic. Whether it is funds for Arctic charting to address the charting backlog in the region, increased support for hydrographic surveys that improve ocean observation/monitoring, or investments in Arctic research—this is a big win for AK.
In an effort to keep our oceans clean, the Omnibus Appropriations bill recently signed into law includes increased funding for NOAA’s Marine Debris Program, which will help reduce marine debris and its adverse impacts on the marine environment. https://t.co/0UxW6zzSep
Best of luck to all the teams who officially kicked off the #Iditarod2019 in Whittier today! https://t.co/6VV6QJ0sgZ

This means that firefighters or teachers who have dedicated years of service won't see unfair reductions in their benefits for choosing a new career path. Public workers deserve to earn the same Social Security benefits as employees in the private sector. https://t.co/8QJ39cIVoj
I'm proud to cosponsor the Social Security Fairness Act, which repeals outdated social security law provisions that unfairly reduce or eliminate Social Security benefits that public sector employees have earned. The goal is to make the social security program as fair as possible. https://t.co/9fQIFvtSHx
My interior bill funds infrastructure improvements &amp; deferred maintenance on America’s public lands &amp; increases funding for Forest Service recreation activities which will go a long way in keeping Alaska’s tourism industry thriving.
Alaska’s tourism industry thrives in large part b/c of the many opportunities we have to enjoy the great outdoors. But if we want to ensure that tourists &amp; our local visitors are able to continue to appreciate AK’s national parks, we must dedicate resources to help maintain https://t.co/uZe1VZdak4
Great riding with musher Jeff King on the first 11 miles of the Iditarod sled dog race. Love the Iditarod! https://t.co/q23J9lU7DE
The icing on the cake was getting to kick off the ceremonial start of the Iditarod by riding Jeff King’s tag sled for the first 11 miles, from downtown Anchorage to Campbell Creek. To Jeff, thanks for giving me this unforgettable experience &amp; to each of the 52 athletes-good luck! https://t.co/MdTQcdfS1q
Today marked the start of one of my favorite Alaskan traditions: the Iditarod. I had a great time visiting with the mushers and their amazing teams. https://t.co/CpIPMsYzu7
The pkg also funds high priority airport construction projects in rural areas along w/ improvements to our state’s transportation infrastructure. With Alaska’s vast size, harsh terrain &amp; limited road systems, this type of investment is more important than ever
The omnibus funding pkg that was just signed into law further supports programs critical to the health, welfare, and safety of many rural Alaskans such as the Essential Air Service, which is a lifeline that connects communities across the state. https://t.co/cdtSvLDrOV
Members of our military have emotional scars that are not always easily visible, but still need extensive care. I’m proud that my interior bill supports the efforts of the NEA to expand the Healing Arts Program, to help returning service members the opportunity to heal and grow. https://t.co/ia0yRluZUV
Good news for Alaskans impacted by the November 30th earthquake:  the deadline for organizations who plan to submit requests to the state in order to receive public assistance has now been extended to April 1st. More information here ➔ https://t.co/meaWvkgCcl
The seafood industry in Alaska is truly an economic engine, not only for our state, but also for all the U.S. The omnibus funding pkg that was just signed into law includes protections for our seafood industry &amp; its consumers, like continuing my fight against GE salmon. https://t.co/3e09yTsVzm
The Interior bill includes funding for a new grant program to help bring basic water and sewer to communities in need. It also includes funding to meet the need for increased water supply, sewage disposal, and solid waste facilities in tribal communities. https://t.co/gO56owhGqQ
Many rural communities across Alaska are w/out access to clean water- a basic necessity that many Americans, perhaps, take for granted. My Interior bill that was recently signed into law includes funding to improve drinking water and wastewater systems. https://t.co/F4PYw3NN8c
At the same time, global demand for electricity is rapidly growing which presents an opportunity for our nation to build a diverse energy supply that is more resilient, more affordable, and more reliable both domestically and globally through technology innovation.
Over the past decade, the United States has transformed into a global energy leader. Last year we set a record for the largest increase in #NatGas production at 12 percent.

Winter months in Alaska often bring moose closer into town looking for food, but this young moose is a “regular” in the Riverview neighbor in Fairbanks.

Bettye was a voice for those without one. She was a shining example of what a public servant should be and her life and legacy serves as an inspiration for all Alaskans. #BlackHistoryisAmericanHistory https://t.co/GnJANvSujg
In honor of #BlackHistoryMonth, I celebrate the late Bettye Davis, the 1st African-American elected to the Alaska House &amp; Senate. Bettye was a strong leader who was committed to the service of others and Bettye never lost sight of what first inspired her to run for office. https://t.co/tyjsZMMPcT
It’s important that the agency remains focused on its core mission. I intend to continue to press Administrator Wheeler on issues of concern raised by Alaskans and to hold him to his promise and commitment to ensuring accountability, fairness, and transparency by the agency.
He will continue to carry out @EPA’s mission to ensure clean air, clean water, as well as addressing challenges like climate change. Alaskans have voiced their objections to overreaching, burdensome regs that they have seen come out of the EPA in the previous administration.
I voted to confirm Andrew Wheeler to be @EPA Administrator. He has proven himself during his tenure as Acting EPA Administrator as a leader who hears and takes seriously the concerns of Alaskans.
These four women who served as mathematicians, programmers, &amp; engineers @NASA overcame significant hurdles to attain their educational &amp; professional goals &amp; are still important role models, today. I hope this bill encourages young women across the U.S to pursue careers in STEM. https://t.co/4QAyYxOmaH
As #BlackHistoryMonth ends, I'm glad to honor unsung heroes of U.S. aeronautics by introducing the Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act, awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson &amp; Dr. Christine Darden https://t.co/fzSe2Fa6PR
Thank you @POTUS for spending time with our servicemen and servicewomen during a quick fuel stop in Alaska on the way back from a high stakes summit with North Korea. Thank you for ensuring that America’s interests remain paramount.
It also funds the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program, which maximizes the resources available to aid law enforcement and improve drug control efforts at a state and local level. (Regions with this designation include areas surrounding Juneau, Anchorage, and Fairbanks.)
This legislation provides funding for anti-opioid programs within the @TheJusticeDept to further combat the opioid &amp; heroin epidemic, giving those impacted a better chance to break the cycle of addiction.

My Interior bill includes significant funding for the construction, upkeep, and improvement of Village Built Clinics to help ensure that Alaskans living in remote parts of the state have access to quality care-- just one of many wins for Alaska included in the bill. https://t.co/hRqNuHshF7
Village Built Clinics are truly the backbone of Alaska’s rural health program, often serving as the only source of medical care available in rural areas. Unfortunately, many of these facilities are in need of intense maintenance and repairs.
RT @SenPatRoberts: Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation to protect rural Critical Access Hospitals and their patients along with @Jim…
The President signed into law a funding pkg that includes my Interior Appropriations bill which provides support for public safety &amp; justice programs. Funding for training &amp; tribal court systems will empower Alaskans to create safe &amp; healthy communities. https://t.co/gO56owhGqQ
I’m proud to reintroduce the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act to help remove loopholes &amp; close gaps in coverage, ensuring patients receive the medical attention they need and have actually paid for without worrying that an insurer will deny a claim. https://t.co/sUkvUn8G25
Access to quality, affordable healthcare for everyone remains a top priority of mine. While many states require insurers to provide health coverage for services related to congenital anomalies or birth defects, health plans routinely deny certain claims.
I’m proud both chambers showed strong support of our #LandsPackage2019 w/ lands, water management, sportsmen &amp; conservation measures. It took us years of bipartisan, bicameral work to reach this point and I am hopeful @POTUS will sign it ✍🏼into law soon. https://t.co/gLFWmCpyfX https://t.co/qF3txPNUNa
The #LandsPackage2019, which passed the Senate 92-8, today passed the House w/ strong bipartisan support. This pkg contains over 120 public lands, water, &amp; natural resource bills. Here's what others are saying on the bill:	➡https://t.co/1F6i9YGfCM
I am proud to cosponsor the Breast Cancer Patient Equity Act, legislation that supports and empowers breast cancer patients and survivors, alongside alongside @SenDuckworth, @RepJudyChu, &amp; @RepWalorski. https://t.co/qTLGRn0PIO
Over 3.1 million women in the U.S. have a history of breast cancer—a diagnosis that changes your life forever. For those who’ve championed what is, perhaps, the greatest battle of their life, it's only right that we expand coverage to help them recover physically &amp; emotionally.
Whether it’s improving healthcare facilities and healthcare delivery, caring for youth, fighting opioid abuse &amp; addiction, or increasing resources to address domestic violence, substance abuse &amp; suicide prevention, this bill is helping create healthier Alaskan communities.
I’m proud that my Interior Appropriations bill that was recently signed into law prioritizes the health and wellness of Alaskans through a range of initiatives. https://t.co/NieHZjiep8 https://t.co/1SEWNvbQcY

I’m proud to cosponsor the VA Tribal Advisory Committee Act, bipartisan legislation that promotes the govt-to-govt relationship b/w the VA &amp; our nation’s tribes, ensuring our Native people have a seat at the table. https://t.co/sVdUrIQ6VU
America’s first people have served America in distinction in every conflict for the past 2 centuries. Yet, it seems it is only in this past decade that the VA has been paying special attention to the needs of Native vets, many of whom live in the most remote areas of the country.

As I have said before, we must have confidence that Bristol Bay’s world-class fisheries are fully protected, and I expect the Army Corps process to remain fair, rigorous, and transparent as Alaskans provide their views. https://t.co/rDTyNnmgGR
It's critical for us to understand the potential impacts of this project. Those who are interested will have an opportunity to submit written comments and participate in public meetings around Alaska in March and April.
The @USACEHQ has released a draft environmental impact statement for the proposed Pebble mine. While it will take time to review this 1,400-page document and its supporting materials, I have begun to do so and encourage all Alaskans to do the same.
As we work to fight back against the epidemic of addiction we’re experiencing across Alaska, I appreciate the efforts that @CITCAlaska is making to change and ultimately save lives. https://t.co/mABoVm3LhT
It was moving to hear directly from Alaskans about the impact the center is having in their lives, such as how the center addresses the emotional, spiritual, physical, and mental aspects of recovery in a way that honors their culture and traditions.
I visited @CITCAlaska's new Ernie Turner Center in Chugiak, a recovery facility that offers on average, 6 month-long inpatient services to those recovering from addiction w/ a model founded on Alaska Native traditions, peer support, community building &amp; leadership development. https://t.co/hZ8EeBJxh5
As a representative of Alaska, and a dog-lover, I was so impressed by the thoughtful planning and passion that went into developing this facility. Thanks to Dr. McPeck and his staff for a great experience.
This full-service facility includes a dog blood bank, a pharmacy, dental services, the only in-house stem cell lab in the state.The clinic is currently under construction to also include an animal rehabilitation center as well as the first oncology service for pets in the state. https://t.co/jTX2blZdar
Tier 1 Veterinary Medical Center in Palmer opened up last summer and now serves as the largest animal clinic in the Mat-Su Valley. I recently visited the clinic and met Dr. Sean McPeck, an Army veteran, veterinarian and the Founder/CEO of Tier 1. https://t.co/7N7koZckJg
I also had a chance to give praise to the community of Palmer for the economic growth and job development they’ve seen recently. I love to see how many Alaskans are excited to call the Mat-Su Valley their home. https://t.co/eDPMR1l1ue
For example, the bill that was recently signed into law provides $900M for capital projects that generate economic development &amp; improve access to reliable, safe &amp; affordable transportation--investing in road, rail, transit &amp; port projects to maintain networks critical to AK.
During my visit to the Mat-Su Valley, I spoke to the Palmer Chamber of Commerce about my efforts to foster growth and prosperity for Alaska. The recently passed omnibus bill includes funding for critical programs that support development in our communities. https://t.co/OrTarmZ0MQ

As a former Alaska lawmaker, Bettye got up every day with a mission of doing something for somebody —somebody who couldn't speak for themselves, who couldn't express themselves, or who just needed a kind word—that’s the kind of legacy everyone should hope to leave behind. https://t.co/IZvIihaCfd
I recently placed a statement on Bettye’s story in the Congressional Record so that there is a permanent record of Bettye’s life for Alaskans to reminisce over, for scholars to research, and for young people to emulate. https://t.co/u5oh4NwN2b
Yesterday I had the honor of speaking at the Bettye Davis African American Summit Breakfast. While I am saddened to know that Bettye is now a part of our history rather than our present- I was glad to speak to the many accomplishments she had in life. https://t.co/mMQLil1v6N

In a time of fiscal uncertainty, it's pivotal that we provide stability where Alaskans need it most— in our communities and in our economy. This Interior-Environment funding bill helps ensure the health, well-being, and safety of Alaskans.
My Interior-Environment bill was just signed into law as part of a seven-bill funding package for FY 2019. This bill provides an economic boost to communities and investments in health, safety, and our lands. Read more here: https://t.co/gO56owzhio

The funding bill just signed into law fully funds a heavy polar security cutter and initial $ for a 2nd. I've been pushing to fund the acquisition of a fleet of Arctic-capable #icebreakers for safety &amp; security of the #Arctic region and our national security as a whole.
We know that the threat of cyberattacks by our foreign adversaries and other sophisticated entities is real and growing, and the consequences of a successful cyberattack would be widespread and devastating.

Today, the take away is that we’ve kept the government open and the good work that we’ve been doing in the Appropriations Committee for months is now going to be moving forward.
We’ve just passed a bill that will keep the government open and finalize our remaining appropriations bills for FY 2019. This funding package addresses some of our border security issues, fully funds a heavy polar security cutter, as well as a range of other initiatives. https://t.co/lZ9Dyxt6Ys

Alongside @SenatorEWarren I introduced the Native American Suicide Prevention Act to ensure Alaska Native communities have a voice in developing/implementing culturally relevant suicide prevention &amp; intervention strategies. Our goal is to save lives and to give hope to Alaskans.
AK consistently tops the charts with some of the highest suicide rates in the U.S. w/ a disproportionately high rate in Native communities. When someone takes their own life, families &amp; often entire communities are impacted by the shock &amp; grief. https://t.co/cIoSEYrqjt

#LandsPackage2019 renews National Geologic Mapping Act Reauthorization Act, helping us map more of AK's world-class mineral base, important for our efforts to diversify our economy &amp; create new jobs &amp; revenues, but also for improving our nation’s weakened mineral security.
The #LandsPackage2019 also enables small miners the ability to get back to business, by reinstating the claims of four Alaska miners who had their claims taken away as a result of an administrative error.
My bipartisan #LandsPackage2019 addresses priorities in Alaska, such as a provision to provide routing flexibility for the Alaska gasline project in Denali National Park and Preserve.

The Land and Water Conservation Fund was enacted to help preserve, develop, and assure access to outdoor recreation resources. My bipartisan #LandsPackage2019 permanently reauthorizes the #LWCF with meaningful and commonsense reforms that have been in my view, a long time coming.
Our bill includes a number of important western water provisions. We improve water management by taking important steps to provide greater local control over water resources and promote management that balances the needs of water users with fish and wildlife protection.
My bipartisan #LandsPackage2019 currently on the Senate floor is about more than just lands – it’s about #water too. https://t.co/Cx2lIqPfCV
Proud to join Senator @ChrisVanHollen and other colleagues by supporting the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019.  This bill would provide federal employees with a 2.6 percent cost of living increase. Read more 	➡https://t.co/NieHZjiep8
I am going to continue to fight for the good men and women that make up our nation’s federal workforce, ensuring they are fairly and adequately compensated, and to make sure that we show our workers the respect they have earned.

I met w/ the Women’s Sports Foundation, a group of Olympians &amp; top-level athletes who are also excellent role-models for girls around the world. We discussed how athletics can empower women and girls in all aspects of their lives and inspire them to do great things. https://t.co/BuCuJg07lv
I will not let our Alaska Native Vietnam veterans be forgotten as we work to make good on this long overdue commitment to provide these veterans with the land allotments they earned and rightfully deserve.
Proud to support @SenDanSullivan's Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act, which is included in the #LandsPackage2019 before the Senate. This bill ensures the federal government fulfills its decades-old promise to Alaska Natives who served in the Vietnam War. https://t.co/02TUMTyH2M
The bill would reauthorize the Native American Languages Preservation Act through FY2024, decreases the number of students required to participate in programs in order to receive funding, &amp; makes it easier for smaller Native communities to receive language revitalization grants.
Senate Indian Affairs Cmte unanimously advanced the Esther Martinez Native American Languages Programs Reauthorization Act (I introduced w/ @SenatorTomUdall) to support Native American language revitalization programs for consideration by the full Senate. https://t.co/vwiGUsvNP4 https://t.co/bAwGStuq4q
Our bill enhances opportunities for hunters, anglers, and outdoor recreation enthusiasts, strengthens land conservation, and helps boost the outdoor recreation economy.
My bipartisan #LandsPackage2019 includes a bill to improve access &amp; provide new opportunities for Americans to enjoy our federal lands. The Sportsmen’s Act provision makes federal lands “open unless closed”, establishing a new standard of access for access to our public lands. https://t.co/J5rwBSDobg
Whether it’s hiking, hunting, or fishing, these are traditions that have been passed down for generations. Americans should be able to access and enjoy their public lands. It’s as simple as that.
Our lands package creates a Volcano Watch Office that will operate 24-7 to provide continuous situational awareness of all active volcanoes in the US &amp; territories.

Reality is that often sexual assault survivors are unable to develop a case against their attacker due to the lack of trained individuals to help collect the necessary forensic evidence. Every victim has the right to access care &amp; to be given the opportunity to pursue justice. https://t.co/IZFloWtLqK
I reintroduced a bill w/ @SenatorMurray to improve &amp; expand access to healthcare services for survivors of sexual assault.

To help victims of sexual trauma seek justice and deal with their trauma, @SenatorTester and I introduced the Servicemember and Veterans’ Empowerment and Support Act. We must ensure our nation’s heroes have the support and care they need and deserve.
The issue of sexual assault and trauma is an alarming underside of military culture that we haven’t been able to adequately address. https://t.co/CZqw52kWKj
In TX we enable revitalization of a multi-use recreation area for visitors. Our bill also encourages agencies to look for new opportunities for fishing, hunting &amp; recreation on fed lands. I’m proud of the many provisions in our bill that will spur economic growth &amp; create jobs.
For example, in AZ we facilitate the development of a large-scale solar project that will link into an electronic transmission line, bringing renewable #energy online to power communities. In SD, this bill allows for an airport expansion.
My bipartisan lands package currently before the full Senate conveys tens of thousands of acres of federal land to state &amp; local governments to create economic opportunities for communities across the nation. https://t.co/JBHcnqNF6u
In order to achieve breakthrough technology solutions, we must ensure that the policies we put in place propel those efforts. We also need a shared long-term strategy for energy policy and for alignment between industry, the federal government, and our National Labs.

It’s time for us to pass this package – to show our strong support, send it on to the House of Representatives, and then to the President’s desk. https://t.co/HDTNWL7sqQ
This package benefits Alaska as well - for example, it provides routing flexibility for our proposed natural gas pipeline and creates new economic opportunities for communities like Kake and Utqiagvik. https://t.co/ODGmpH489b
This package contains huge wins for Americans - for example, it provides new opportunities for economic development through land conveyances &amp; exchanges. It also expands &amp; enhances access for our sportsmen &amp; women on federal lands for hunting, fishing, &amp; other outdoor activities. https://t.co/WkssNThDzk
Today I spoke on the Senate Floor about the importance of advancing the bipartisan lands package I introduced w/ @SenatorCantwell and @Sen_JoeManchin, containing over 100 different public lands, natural resources, and water measures supported by both chambers. https://t.co/rlG1ah27Y2

In 2017, we imported 50% of 50 mineral commodities, and 100% of 21 minerals. Whether we realized it or not, both energy and minerals are essential to our everyday lives, and reliance on foreign nations for these minerals is not an outlook we want to be stuck in.
We have moved from being a country struggling with energy independence to the world’s largest producer of oil and natural gas, with renewables growing rapidly as well. However, our nation is lagging in mineral supply. https://t.co/5OBZUD7E1y https://t.co/7Vf5VY9NkH

He already has helped the Department accomplish a great deal for Alaska &amp; the nation, both as deputy &amp; acting secretary, and he's more than capable of leading on a permanent basis. I will schedule a hearing &amp; seek to move his nomination forward as expeditiously as possible.

I am deeply saddened by the passing of my longtime friend &amp; a true Alaskan legend Mike Dalton.

As a cosponsor of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act, I want to not only ensure that these federal workers receive backpay, but also that they are told when they'll receive their missed pay. After so much anxiety, we should give them as much certainty as possible.
Today I joined Sen. @ChrisVanHollen &amp; 27 other Senate colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, urging the Administration to provide backpay as soon as possible for federal workers impacted by the gov. shutdown. https://t.co/0YtZouiB5r
This bill will allow for greater partnerships between law enforcement &amp; ensure they have accurate data from which to work. It also ensures that law enforcement has the resources and cultural understanding to wholly and effectively address this epidemic. https://t.co/7HiSimhBrI
In AK many rural communities lack public safety &amp; are often hundreds of miles away from the nearest community with a Village Public Safety Officer or State Trooper. Compound that w/ the fact AK lacks a unified 911 system, which makes accessing resources even more challenging.
Proud to reintroduce Savanna’s Act alongside @SenCortezMasto to continue our efforts to bring much needed attention &amp; coordination to the issue of murdered &amp; missing Native women. We have a duty of moral trust toward our nation’s first people &amp; we must be part of the solution. https://t.co/TYCGq09hwX
For the ERA to be incorporated into the Constitution, we need 38 states to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment. As of now, we have 37. The bill I’m leading, alongside @SenatorCardin will resolve any ambiguity over whether states can make the ERA effective by ratifying it this year.
The Equal Rights Amendment is as important in the fight for women’s equality as it was in 1972, when AK ratified. Women’s equality is fundamental to the American way of life &amp; needs to be expressly recognized in the Constitution. https://t.co/uAUrQJgdKj

I have heard the urgency. And it's not just from our Coast Guard men and women---but also those who work for agencies, their families, and those who rely on their services.
This has been a harsh &amp; a difficult time for so many, particularly coming from a state like Alaska where we are feeling the direct impacts of the partial shutdown, perhaps more so than any other state out there w/ how many fed. employees we have per capita. https://t.co/rlxposN8wq
The President’s news today was good news- especially for federal employees that have either been furloughed or working without pay for 35 days as they will finally be able to get back to work &amp; receive compensation.

While these measures did not advance today, everybody—from both sides of the aisle, both chambers, and the administration—need to come together to find a path forward. I am committed to finding a way to get the gov. open and end this shutdown. We owe it to the American people.
Thousands more are either working without pay, or are furloughed and unable to do their jobs. Whether it is TSA workers, Air Traffic Controllers, or those who have oversight of our fisheries at NOAA and NMFS, the list goes on.
From individual industries such as aviation and fisheries to entire communities—Alaskans are facing widespread, detrimental impacts as a result of the partial government shutdown. @USCG members are still hard at work—maintaining national security and protecting life &amp; property.
Today I voted on two measures that would have immediately reopened the government, and ensured that tens of thousands of federal employees receive their paychecks. https://t.co/Rv2bKYREkU

The issues at our border and impasse over our immigration system weaken America but an indefinite government shutdown is equally damaging to our economy, our security and the well-being of the American people. This needs to end now.
It has become clear that negotiations to this point have led us to an impasse. I welcome the President’s decision to put an offer on the table today and will review it in full once details are released. I will encourage my colleagues to do the same.
I am deeply disappointed we have not been able to advance a more positive solution to reopen the government and address border security, but my frustration is nothing compared to these families. We owe it to the people of this country to get this place working again.

That court decision upends decades of cooperation between the State of AK &amp; AK tribes to ensure that Native children in need of aid are placed in culturally supportive environments. ICWA is among the most significant pieces of Indian legislation Congress has ever enacted.
.@RepDonyoung &amp; I, alongside five other Congressional colleagues, filed an amicus curiae brief w/ the Fifth Circuit, US Court of Appeals in support of the Indian Child Welfare Act or ICWA. This follows an Oct 4, 2018 Texas federal court ruling deeming ICWA as unconstitutional.
In Alaska, @usdafsa offices in Palmer and Delta Junction will open on January 17, 18, and 22 for limited purposes. If you have questions or need assistance from FSA, please contact the offices directly. https://t.co/Rkh1rY5291

For the sake of @USCG, AK's maritime activities &amp; national security, I’m proud to support the Pay our Coast Guard Act &amp; the End Government Shutdowns Act, to permanently end gov. shutdowns w/good sense solution to avoid a funding lapse--for our fed. workers, families &amp; our nation.
There's no reason for our 5th military branch or any of the thousands of other furloughed federal employees &amp; contractors to be held hostage due to a political dispute. As @USCG members continue to put their lives on the line to keep us safe &amp; secure, I'll continue to do my part. https://t.co/lqureVghQw
Our legislation provides significant support through authorizing grants which will allow us to take a step towards changing the economic landscape in rural Alaska and mapping the economic future of Alaska Native communities by merging culture with development.
Today I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill w/ @SenBrianSchatz &amp; @repdonyoung to create a pilot project which promotes sustainable economic growth &amp; creates efforts to reduce poverty in remote Native American &amp; Native Hawaiian communities. 	https://t.co/BD80o8Dt0J

Native language preservation is gaining momentum and schools like the newly named Juneau-Douglas https://t.co/FnXKK5j7yd Kalé High School are paving the way. Proud to see young Alaskans focused on keeping traditional language alive. https://t.co/WusyEdIwge
I’ve heard from some regarding the gov't shutdown that those impacted can just go out &amp; get a second job. But there are many communities in Alaska where you don't have a lot of options. These secondary jobs are simply not available to many of our rural Alaskans. https://t.co/sE13hHTNVJ
We want border security. I think that the President's request for a comprehensive view of how we address this is not so unreasonable. Let's treat his border priority as a request for supplemental appropriations. But let's not keep the gov't shut down while we do this. https://t.co/4sAuuGoza0
We had a tough earthquake November 30 that a lot of folks are still digging out of-- many of which have to pay contractors to address the damage that occurred. These folks are feeling a lot of anxiety b/c many of them are depending on paychecks that they won't receive right away. https://t.co/S8fK64hTxL
We all appreciate the work of the Coast Guard who are helping Americans every day and putting their lives on the line for us. So the fact that they are not protected b/c of the gov't shutdown at this point in time causes me great concern, anxiety, &amp; stress-- as is it does them. https://t.co/gCxCW1gom7
This legislation permanently ends government shutdowns with a commonsense solution to avoid a funding lapse, ensuring the jobs and livelihoods of federal workers and contractors are not held hostage during political disputes. https://t.co/kjLKIghAR3

Thanks to an agreement reached with many of my colleagues, it was placed directly on the Senate calendar yesterday through the Rule 14 process for expedited consideration early in this Congress.
Yesterday, @SenatorCantwell &amp; I reintroduced a bipartisan pkg of more than 100 public lands, natural resources &amp; water bills. While disappointed we weren’t able to pass this at the end of the last Congress, we remain committed to its important provisions. https://t.co/fl2IhwVcPE https://t.co/cdraTIupdA
We as appropriators have done good work on the funding bills not yet enacted, and so I will be actively working with the Majority Leader to finding a solution to fund the government and end this partial government shutdown.
It’s important that we continue the debate on how we address border security &amp; address the President’s top priorities, but it’s possible to provide for security &amp; to address the humanitarian crisis on our border, while still doing our jobs to keep the government fully functional.
I continue to stress that there is no good reason for a shutdown. The reality is thousands of federal employees &amp; contractors have no paycheck in sight, small businesses that rely on them are suffering &amp; there’s no reason they should be held hostage to a political dispute. https://t.co/VBMNUACU78
Approving this request would ensure that federal disaster assistance is made available to those hardest hit by the earthquake and provide much-needed aid to help individuals and communities recover from extensive and widespread damage.

We are taking steps to help prepare for the next big earthquake, which we know is inevitable. One of those steps is the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act, legislation I sponsored w/ @SenFeinstein, which became law earlier this month.
The recent magnitude 7.0 earthquake was an unsettling experience for many Alaskans. Roads collapsed, homes damaged &amp; several schools will be shut for extended periods. Alaskans have asked, “What comes next? What more can we do to help ensure that lives &amp; property are protected?" https://t.co/hbjGWI2KVV

Details on the effects of the partial government shutdown and frequently asked questions can be found on my website here: 	https://t.co/DRFFCqTT9j
Shutting down the government is no way to govern. It is disruptive, harmful, wasteful &amp; could leave hundreds of thousands of federal employees w/out paychecks over Christmas. I’m committed to working w/ my colleagues to end this partial shutdown.  https://t.co/OZ3X2Zd8DO
I'm encouraged that the Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader made a public commitment tonight to keep working to find a solution to funding the government and addressing border security in a manner the President will accept. We owe it to the American people to govern.
I’m disappointed we could not reach an agreement tonight. Funding the government is a fundamental part of our responsibility to govern. We all should commit to end this partial shutdown as soon as possible. https://t.co/yrXJjbt92g
Our nation has benefited from the viewpoints expressed by General Kelly &amp; General Mattis, both of whom are unfortunately leaving the White House. My advice to the President is that he reconsider the Syrian withdrawal as he gets his new senior military team in place.
While I do not support American troops being stationed in Syria indefinitely, I find the administration’s withdrawal troubling and shortsighted. I am equally alarmed by reports of an abrupt reduction in forces from Afghanistan where Alaskans have fought and died.
Secretary Mattis is a strong, respected leader w/ a wealth of knowledge about the issues &amp; challenges facing our national security. His departure leaves a big hole in the cabinet leadership. I thank Secretary Mattis for his leadership &amp; service to the US. https://t.co/FX5p9jgMY9

I commend my Senate colleagues for supporting this legislation to honor the influence of Indigenous women as civil rights activists, warriors, community leaders, and so much more.
The very first anti-discrimination law in the US was signed into law 19 years before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This was accomplished, in large part, because of a Tlingit woman named Elizabeth Peratrovich who spoke to assembled lawmakers arguing for equality.
Alaska Native women have not only played an integral role in leading their communities forward—fighting to defend the sovereignty for Alaska’s tribal nations—but have also been a key factor in preserving their history, heritage, and culture.
The Senate recently passed my resolution recognizing the heritage, culture, and contributions of American Indian, Alaska Native, &amp; Native Hawaiian women in helping shape our country. https://t.co/xoprSpaz48
While I support the bipartisan, good-faith effort of my colleagues to address this important issue, we need more time to evaluate this legislation. It’s very important we get this right.
The Senate moved to take up a pkg that could reduce time that drug traffickers &amp; other convicted felons spend in federal prison in the name of rehabilitation. Reforming our troubled criminal justice system deserves the Senate’s full attention &amp; should not be rushed through.
Particularly in light of the holidays, it was great to share dinner, swap stories &amp; take time to appreciate all the @AKFisherHouse has done.

I’m seeking to fund a system of arctic ports, ports of refuge for ships in trouble and ports to send, receive, and transport goods and people as well as private aids to navigation, all-weather tugs that can help ships that may have lost power or steerage.
Currently the US has 2 icebreakers. One is permanently in dry dock &amp; she's never going to see activity again. The other one is on her 2nd life down in Antarctica.

The importance of access to healthcare cannot be understated, and I am committed to ensuring that all Alaskans have access to affordable, quality healthcare.
I want to give Alaskans &amp; all Americans, the certainty they need that protections for those with pre-existing conditions will remain intact, which is why I support legislation to make certain no one loses coverage based on health status.
In AK healthcare remains a priority &amp; concern. The Texas v. Azar ruling has no immediate impact &amp; I'm confident higher courts will review the decision. Regardless, we must preserve the provisions of the ACA that have benefited so many, like protections for pre-existing conditions

In Alaska the Village Public Safety Officers (VPSO) are often the first &amp; only responder in a community. The harsh reality we face in Alaska is that we have many rural communities that are hundreds of miles away from the nearest community w/ a VPSO or member of law enforcement.

In many parts of Alaska, women lack any form of access to maternity care. I am proud that my Senate colleagues supported my bill to improve access to maternity care, which will reduce rates of pregnancy-related deaths &amp; lower healthcare costs, long-term. https://t.co/D7wyPE497C
This Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) program is going to be instrumental in improving the quality of life, health, and safety of residents in the lower Yukon River Delta region. Also addresses a growing demand for durable port infrastructure.
Today @SenDanSullivan, @DonYoungAK, and I announced a $23.1 million @USDOT grant for Emmonak, Alaska to construct a permanent dock and barge/landing craft ramp &amp; to renovate approximately 3.5 miles of high-use service roads, a huge boom for the region. https://t.co/TCrlL81GZY
Congrats to Major Gregory “Fangs” Farrell of the U.S. Air Force for graduating from the Air Force Legislative Fellowship program yesterday! He's been a great addition to my staff for the past year and will be missed—but I look forward to hearing of his continued success. https://t.co/KLSgmJD1nW
I thank @SenDanSullivan for his leadership on this bill and look forward to the improvements it will bring the @USCG and our maritime region. https://t.co/MBtWz4tkwk
From rescue missions to protecting our vital fisheries to monitoring our vast coastline, the men &amp; women of the @USCG work daily to ensure the safety and security of Alaskan waters. Proud that the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018 was signed into law this week.
Given what happened I find myself thinking, “we were lucky.” Not that we were hit by a major earthquake, but in that it could have been so much worse. Alaskans were prepared—just as you would expect us to be. We are tough, resilient, &amp; will come back from this stronger than ever.
.@SenDanSullivan &amp; I flew home this weekend to assess the damage. We have major work ahead to rebuild our roads, schools, ports, &amp; other structures that were damaged. For example, more than 85 schools sustained enough damage that they need time to be cleaned up and repaired.
Early reports came in from 1st responders who had quickly jumped into action, while civil engineers were dispatched to check on highways, bridges, &amp; essential infrastructure like hospitals. We waited to hear reports of serious injuries &amp; fatalities, which fortunately, never came.
My staff in AK called saying that pipes had burst in their houses. One of the main roads in Anchorage had parts of it collapse, trapping cars. In schools across Anchorage &amp; Mat-Su Valley, students hid under desks to “duck &amp; cover” as things crashed to the floor around them.
I'm about to speak on the Senate Floor about the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck just a few miles north of Anchorage on the morning of November 30th. Watch here: https://t.co/UswFLUjudx
My heart goes out to the Bush family and all those who admired him, as we reflect on his great leadership and honor his life of incredible service. #Bush41 https://t.co/fLVVFgbga5
In addition to holding the position of our 41st President, he served 2 terms as Vice President, Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Director of the CIA, &amp; was one of the youngest naval aviators in history during WWII. https://t.co/uLTmyXnjBi
I’m honored to have joined the ceremony to celebrate the life of a great American—President George H.W. Bush—who dedicated his life to public service. As the longest lived President in U.S. History, he leaves behind a legacy that will, no doubt, live on for generations to come. https://t.co/CZjLxlpFve

Extraordinary that we had 0 casualties in this earthquake &amp; only a few injuries. The resilience of Alaskans &amp; our buildings is a testament to lessons learned from the '64 quake &amp; speaks to our level of preparedness. Repair crews are hard at work but we still have a ways to go. https://t.co/i5PvvkAtYT
It was a very raw feeling to stand at the edge of Vine Rd. in Wasilla, looking down into big crevasses of concrete. https://t.co/8EJGrGHpD9
Pics are not able to truly capture the extent of the destruction. @SenDanSullivan &amp; I recently toured some of the earthquake damage, both from the air and on the ground. https://t.co/E1SBtxfWvk
In addition to continued damage assessments, roads are getting repaired &amp; schools cleaned up---examples demonstrating the resilience and resolve in the community. I am proud of all the efforts of those coming together to assist the initial response to the road to recovery. https://t.co/l1K0fAq9sB
I spent the day yesterday in Anchorage and the Mat-Su Valley w/ @SenDanSullivan to see firsthand the impacts from the recent 7.0 magnitude earthquake. I was thankful for the opportunity to receive updates on disaster response efforts--- from the local, state, and federal levels. https://t.co/SWrrAvkABw
I’m thankful for the safety of the students and the staff who were in the building, because while the magnitude was significant, the impact is one we can fix. https://t.co/qFBNl0ARzX
Houston Middle sustained so much structural damage that it’s been deemed unsafe for students to come back to this facility for the rest of the school year. Devastation we saw included cinder blocks coming out of the ceiling, side walls coming apart, exposed steel, and debris. https://t.co/EnFdZROvFu
It was gut wrenching to be in Houston Middle School &amp; to imagine what it was like for the students Friday morning when the quake hit.

My heart is heavy for the Bush family. President George H.W. Bush served our nation with unwavering dedication and integrity. A Naval Aviator, statesman &amp; public servant—we are grateful for his lifetime of service. His life &amp; legacy will be forever remembered in American history.
Alaskans are incredibly resilient but that doesn’t mean that when you’re hit with something of this intensity it doesn’t have a substantial and devastating impact. The message I want to convey to friends, family, and Alaskans across the state is that we are on top of this.
The impact is very real and will require a great deal of recovery and effort, but I have been assured that Alaskans will have what they need to deal with and recover from this very serious earthquake.
Today @repdonyoung &amp; @SenDanSullivan and I received a briefing from @fema on the 7.0 earthquake which struck near Anchorage, AK.

In Alaska we’re particularly proud of a Tlingit woman, Elizabeth Peratrovich, an advocate early on in terms of anti-discrimination laws, as she was instrumental in securing the Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945, which was the very first anti-discrimination law in the U.S.

Abraham Lincoln once said, “All creation is a mine. Every man is a miner” – we might be adapting it but that’s a good description of where we are in our modern lives.

Alaska was built on mining &amp; it’s been a significant path to prosperity. It’s because of the extraordinary resources we have: gold, copper, zinc, silver, graphite, and more. We are a world-class destination, but we can do so much more to build on our state’s prosperity.
Every man, woman, and child is a beneficiary of the mining industry. Honored to speak at #AlaskaMiners2018 in Anchorage today about mining in AK, promising projects on the horizon, and ways we are working together to improve our mineral security. https://t.co/PGuL6C15JR

I had a great meeting with the Mat-Su Borough recently to get an update on how they are addressing cyber security, after receiving a cyber-attack within Borough computers three months ago. https://t.co/OEQj7qI8io
While this month of awareness has given us the opportunity to highlight this significant issue, we have in Alaska and across the nation, our efforts cannot end here. Domestic Violence is an ongoing issue that must remain in our focus each and every day. https://t.co/ZFeI9YHyIq
I want to thank all those in Alaska for what they are doing to provide shelter and services to help individuals and families feel safe. https://t.co/y7ypPANGdw
Throughout the month of October, designated as Domestic Violence Awareness month, I’ve visited facilities across Alaska that are providing safe environments for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault including TWC in Bethel, a shelter in Valdez, and AWAIC in Anchorage. https://t.co/eH29WslsSI
#HappyHalloween from Alaska! My son Nic might be in his 20s, but as a proud mom that doesn't stop me from wearing a pumpkin necklace he made me in Elementary School. https://t.co/o2ZVWTb3Sr
While touring these facilities, it was such a joy to watch the children learn and play and to talk with staff about their contributions to building strong families in the Mat-Su Valley. I have been and will remain a strong supporter of Head Start &amp; Early Head Start. https://t.co/6Hrl6ArQ9k
It was wonderful to visit the CCS Early Learning Head Start and Early Head Start facilities in Wasilla yesterday and see how the dedicated caregivers and educators are making such a positive impact in the lives of these young Alaskans and their parents. https://t.co/xGKzPwlhlV
Fresh snow and sunshine make for a gorgeous day in the Mat-Su Valley. https://t.co/bWMUcB11td
I’m grateful for strong leaders like Ms. Riha and Mr. Bera who are committed to providing a quality education for each of their students. Special thanks to each award recipient and all of the Teacher of the Year finalists for all they continue to do on behalf of our students.
Ms. Riha is committed to providing a culturally relevant learning environment for students while encouraging them to each be the best they can be, personally and academically.
Congratulations to Alaska Native Cultural Charter School teacher Danielle Riha on being named the 2019 Alaska Teacher of the Year and to Jacob Bera on being named the 2019 Alternate Teacher of the Year. https://t.co/g5s9giZNgM
It’s always helpful to understand what’s happening on the ground and steps that are being taken to maintain Alaska’s infrastructure, especially one of the world’s largest pipeline systems.
I visited the @AlyeskaPipeline Terminal in Valdez, the end of the line for the 800-mile-long Trans Alaska Pipeline System. I learned about new methods and tools Alyeska is utilizing to conduct pipe inspections, both externally &amp; internally, thanks to technology advances. https://t.co/wfuks7pGB5
SERVS was established to prevent oil spills &amp; provide oil spill response services to the Trans Alaska Pipeline marine oil shippers. The new vessels are truly state-of-the-art but equally important, the training &amp; efforts by crews to prioritize safety &amp; protecting the environment. https://t.co/j6k7FBY8fC
In Valdez I had an up-close look at the new Ship Escort/Response Vessel System (SERVS) fleet. I went onboard a 146 ft long, 52 ft wide @EdisonChouestAK escort tug --one of the new tugs to assist tankers in the safe navigation through Prince William Sound. https://t.co/3K8gjqDi0y
I had a tour of the Valdez Fisheries Development Association Solomon Gulch Hatchery, which has a capacity for more than 250 million pink salmon eggs, along with a 95% high survival rate at the hatchery. https://t.co/iXUjVITp4I
Today I visited w/ students at Hermon Hutchens Elementary in Valdez. I loved touring the classrooms where students showed me some of their work— from designing bridges, to working on biographies about famous Alaskans, and their Crooked Creek Chum Salmon Incubation Project. https://t.co/4kiwzZEGqd
What happened in Pittsburgh was horrific and senseless. My prayers go out to all the victims and their families. We must work to eradicate hate in our society.
I was glad to be a part of the grand opening for their state of the art training facility, which will allow Yuut to help meet the growing need for A&amp;P mechanics in the Y-K Delta and nationwide. https://t.co/yVQMpic5zq
An exciting addition to Yuut's current training opportunities is the new FAA certified Yuut Elitnaurviat Aviation Maintenance Technician Program. https://t.co/slw2wUX48i
Yuut Elitnaurviat in Bethel offers a range of training programs aimed at preparing the people of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta to take on local well-paying jobs. https://t.co/jvXaruQ4Nc
Proud to attend a Congressional Gold Medal ceremony in Anchorage this weekend for five Filipino veterans who served in WWII — a long overdue recognition for their service in fighting for our country. https://t.co/cuOmNYop4C
As a result of this discovery, not only are individuals in the village motivated to replicate some of the pieces, but they have also inspired a cultural curriculum to be developed for Kuinerrarmiut Elitnaurvik School—both great efforts to help keep the Yup’ik culture alive. https://t.co/qSY2NNwgpw
Fast forward to today, the village of Quinhagak has created a local museum to house the 70,000+ artifacts that have been uncovered. During my visit I had the amazing opportunity to see everything from baskets, masks, and spoons, to knives, ulus, and jewelry. https://t.co/amnOAUAMTE
In 2009, archeologists from the University of Aberdeen and other international institutions alongside village residents, including children, began excavating artifacts from an ancient site called Nunalleq near the village of Quinhagak. https://t.co/7jRNhI3lMH
Beyond their facility, TWC is also working throughout the Yukon-Kuskokwim region to increase education and prevention initiatives for students, teachers, and communities to help prevent sexual assault and domestic violence in future generations.
Alaska has alarmingly high rates of sexual assault &amp; violence against women, particularly against Alaska Native women. Thankfully the Tundra Women’s Coalition (TWC) is working to empower women &amp; provide a safe environment for women &amp; children through their new shelter in Bethel. https://t.co/S0n7xavMb4
The clinic is in very rough shape. This visit was a reminder that as we move forward in our work to improve healthcare, we must ensure that remote communities have the resources and infrastructure they need to provide adequate care. https://t.co/TyORm0QPxu
One of the things I heard over and over during my visit to Quinagak was the need for a new clinic. I had a chance to stop in and see the existing facility which sees about 25 patients a day through the care of 5 community health aids. https://t.co/uqwc5Mu9Ss
Following my presentation, the students gave me a special Alaska Native dance performance (and even invited me to join them!) A great visit to a great school. https://t.co/jp4bbywB8C
Yesterday I visited the students and staff of Kuinerrarmiut Elitnaurvik School in Quinhagak. After hearing from their Principal, Peggie Price, I spoke to the student body on my work as a Senator and asked the students for feedback on what knowledge I should take back w/ me to DC https://t.co/kwcVprLEA0
With severe rain and flooding causing a real threat to the community of Seward, this is an important step towards finding a long-term solution.
One of the provisions I secured in America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which was recently signed into law, requires the Army Corps to perform a Lowell Creek flood control study, a feasibility study that will help develop options to deal with this flood control system. https://t.co/Lmp6mwzlYu
Lowell Creek tunnel is a 2,070-foot-long passage that helps protect the City of Seward from damaging floodwaters by diverting the water through Bear Mountain to a waterfall south of the city. Unfortunately, the tunnel is in need of major repair. https://t.co/jlNnsBdWlL
As a port community that is connected by both rail and road, Seward is well positioned to grow, prosper, and to continue to add so much to Alaska’s overall livelihood. https://t.co/AtJTbI4NxA
I’m always thankful for the chance to sit down with city leaders to talk through some of the work I’m doing in D.C. and to get updates on the most pressing needs they’re seeing at a local level. https://t.co/M63mND6Zvz
In addition to hydro provisions, this bill will also ensure safe drinking water for our communities and further develop water infrastructure across the nation-- significant provisions for the state of Alaska.
After working w/ leaders on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, including @SenDanSullivan and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, I'm proud to have secured a number of water infrastructure and hydropower-related provisions that will benefit our state.
This week the President signed America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 into law.  https://t.co/ueXaYezHU2
Following our meeting I visited classes &amp; spoke w/ students on their educational experience &amp; my work in D.C. Communities across AK are so unique, so it's encouraging to see Principal Walker &amp; his staff working to meet each student exactly where they are. https://t.co/B1oXrMKoKS
This morning, I visited Seward High School and met with Principal Trevan Walker to discuss the school's flexible learning structure and teaching style that allows students to develop in an environment that is conducive to their specific learning styles and personal goals. https://t.co/GOfDxcnVYa
Opioids have caused destruction for far too long. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will create long-term solutions and help heal our families and communities, creating a safer future for our state and nation. https://t.co/08ih6YdGII
.@POTUS just signed into law a critical opioid legislative package which will bolster research initiatives, address workforce shortages, &amp; create a tangible system for measuring progress towards stopping the epidemic. https://t.co/WTdCm2ftKr
Alaska’s Village Police Officers (VPOs) have incredibly difficult jobs. They are police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians and search and rescue coordinators-- all in one. Special thanks to Anna for going above and beyond.
Congrats to Mountain Village police officer Anna Bill on being awarded 2018 Shirley Demientieff Award, presented to an individual or organization who goes above and beyond the call of duty to improve the lives of Alaska Native women &amp; children. https://t.co/Htjf1gnIaw
I’m proud that our community came together to serve our nation’s heroes and was honored to know VA @SecWilkie was among those in attendance. From medical and legal assistance to guidance for housing and employment—thank you to everyone who made this event possible. https://t.co/twQTWbyXpW
Today in Anchorage, over 50 service providers joined together to help meet the needs of many of Alaska’s veterans. https://t.co/GiJ5issKBv
I'm proud of the tremendous support Alaskans show our military. This weekend was no different when hundreds showed up to the airport to welcome home and thank this group of veterans for their service as they returned from DC for the Last Frontier Honor Flight. https://t.co/8FVki8Vr09
The voices of the Alaska Native communities are so important to me. Whether it's in the halls of Washington DC, in Alaska, or even in venues like Reykjavik--- I carry the stories they share, the insights that they offer, and the wisdom they bring with me everywhere I go. https://t.co/C4Nc5UjUdD
Yesterday I livestreamed into AFN to give an update on my work in DC. I covered everything from climate change and Alaska's role in our national security to the importance of bringing indigenous voices into federal policy making &amp; the need to develop safer communities across AK. https://t.co/kBqAtyx3My
This year I was unable to attend the Alaska Federation of Natives convention as I was representing Alaska at the Arctic Circle Assembly meeting in Iceland. But I couldn't let that stop be from being part of one of my favorite events. https://t.co/mNWZuLWR5r
At @ArcticAssembly here in Reykjavik, Iceland — an aerial view of the Arctic. https://t.co/L7m91cQg1V
Recently a member of my staff hosted Quyana Alaska, held at the AFN convention in Anchorage to celebrate the rich cultural history of various Alaska Native groups through traditional dances &amp; ensure the many unique Native cultures stay connected to their origins. https://t.co/WJGMV9R9Yp
During the @ArcticAssembly for #ArcticCircle2018, I met with Iceland President Gudni Johannesson to discuss ways our nations can partner to create a robust &amp; sustainable future for the Arctic region. We discussed the economy to Arctic shipping and infrastructure needs. https://t.co/NSU26fKJtR
We discussed everything from foreign investment, to growth in tourism, as well as ways to address domestic violence. These opportunities for collaboration with Arctic leaders are invaluable as Alaska continues to develop America’s Arctic presence. https://t.co/TM4qWZdKLS
While at @ArcticAssembly, I met w/ Iceland Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdottir to discuss ways our nations can partner and learn from each other. https://t.co/suLgveYqG7
Soon I’ll be speaking to the AlasSoon I’ll be speaking to the @NativeFed #2018AFN Convention. Watch live here: 	https://t.co/c6OD4BSlxL
As we work to strengthen our global partnerships with our fellow Arctic nations, this was a valuable opportunity for Alaskans to share their unique perspectives. https://t.co/HnlrS5EkPY
The panel included renewable energy leaders from across Alaska, including representatives for Alaska Center for Energy and Power, Juneau Economic Development Council, International Arctic Science Committee, @uaFairbanks, @NANACorporation. https://t.co/JeuesP2fWH
I moderated a discussion at @ArcticAssembly focused on energy innovation and community adaptation underway across Alaska, as a part of the #ArcticCircle2018 in Iceland.
From our experience in operating microgrids and distributed sources of power generation, to the testing grounds for unmanned aerial systems, as well as areas of telehealth &amp; telemedicine, Alaska is an #Arctic leader. #ArcticCircle2018
During @ArcticAssembly opening session I spoke to how Alaskans are driven to pursue responsible economic development while addressing the challenges of a harsh &amp; fragile environment, and acting as good stewards to preserve our resources and our way of life for future generations. https://t.co/pWKWEMgYm2
It is an honor to have Alaska spotlighted during #ArcticCircle2018. From energy innovation to community adaptation and scientific research, Alaskans are leading the way and looking to collaborate with international partners.
Happy to be in Iceland for the @ArcticAssembly –the largest international gathering on #arctic issues. Alaska is well represented here in Iceland as we make the AFN Convention an international affair this year. https://t.co/N2bTbIxfpr

I’m thankful for this opportunity to meet with @CathySandeen, the new @uaaanchorage Chancellor, and Karen Markel, the new Dean of the College of Business and Public Policy, and so many other strong, independent women to celebrate Alaska’s growing group of entrepreneurs. https://t.co/mcS9kjWpii
This week I joined some of these business owners for the Women's Entrepreneurship Week Celebration at @uaaanchorage to discuss ways we can empower &amp; support women in the workforce across Alaska. #WEW2018 https://t.co/aoVcHdsaFF
With over 25% of Alaska’s businesses being female owned, Alaska is leading the charge when it comes to female entrepreneurs. https://t.co/coPFElDwgp
Whaley is a school filled with positive incentives, empowerment, and confidence in a vibrant and caring environment. Special thanks to Robyn and the Whaley School staff and students for hosting my visit. https://t.co/RXIihwiA57
Yesterday I shadowed Robyn Harris, 2018 Alaska Secondary Principal of the Year. Robyn leads a dedicated team of teachers to create a caring, positive school environment where students work hard and are finding success.
Alaska is no stranger to students that face these types of obstacles, so it’s encouraging to see Whaley’s use of the “Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports” model, coupled with a “meet students where they are” attitude, to help facilitate a climate and culture of care.
Today I shadowed Robyn Harris, 2018 Alaska Secondary Principal of the Year. Robyn has been at Whaley School for 7 years, where they serve around 430 students in grades 6-12, many of which struggle with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders among other severe behavioral health issues. https://t.co/oW5qIs9rho
Today 23 veterans left Alaska to head to D.C. as part of the Last Frontier Honor Flight. These men &amp; women proudly served our country in the WWII, Korean, and Vietnam wars. I'm thankful for their service and for the dozens of Alaskans who showed up to give them a proper send off! https://t.co/j43CNLQQZo
As our tribal communities work  to ensure strong leadership &amp; lasting culture, developing these cross-generational relationships within Alaska Native communities is vital. The chance to be a part of this time-honored event is truly invaluable to me. https://t.co/sOGFpEXUeS
Yesterday I attended the First Alaskans Institute’s 35th Annual Elders &amp; Youth Conference in Anchorage. This event allows Native youth to develop their leadership capabilities by joining with Native Elders to learn from their wisdom and experiences. https://t.co/BmRHHq0IjF
Sec. @stevenmnuchin1 also heard from businesses on how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is encouraging economic prosperity by creating jobs, generating new revenue, and growing our economy. I appreciate the Secretary for taking the time to make this trip. https://t.co/tZyw1pPy7J https://t.co/IpnWStkvCC
This past weekend I hosted U.S. Secretary of Treasury @stevenmnuchin1 in AK. For his visit, I brought together local community &amp; business leaders from industries such as tourism, real estate, banking &amp; finance to discuss the unique opportunities &amp; challenges of Alaska's economy. https://t.co/pedK3G8eek
Thanks to the “Ski Moms” of Fairbanks for hosting a gathering where we discussed everything from healthcare to immigration, the separation of powers between branches of government, and support for UAF. I always value the opportunity to meet face to face with my constituents. https://t.co/sECQSypUY2
It was a great opportunity for the Secretary to learn more about the Alaska LNG project and its incredible economic potential. https://t.co/1bY3LFeLZy
In the last few decades, Sovereign Wealth Funds like the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC) have grown significantly. This was a valuable chance to address the benefits &amp; concerns of these funds &amp; for APFC to help the US Treasury understand Alaskan interests. https://t.co/iIhvkTHaBq
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to host United States Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, in Alaska. We met with Governor Walker and Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation board members Sheldon Fisher, Andy Mack, and Angela Rodell (CEO). https://t.co/NbK9ozB5DV
I was honored to receive the American Gas Association’s Natural Gas Century Leader Award last week for my longstanding support of this vital industry, which continues to help power us toward a cleaner energy future. https://t.co/ksVAM8PE5E
As our climate changes, we need to find responsible ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. And, thanks in large part to natural gas, our emissions have dropped in seven of the past 10 years, and are now 14 percent below the 2005 levels. https://t.co/fhAWV8LKJj
Yesterday the President signed into law the Music Modernization Act, legislation I proudly cosponsored, which will bring the music industry up to speed with the evolving 21st century market and ensure that artists are fairly compensated for their work.
The arrival of internet completely changed the game for the music industry. With a variety of streaming services having been developed, many songwriters &amp; producers are either not being paid royalties when their songs are played, or they aren’t paid market value for their work. https://t.co/NX0pPVnRPL
Hundreds of millions of people would be left in the dark, power lines no longer energized, and generating stations would be off.  America can’t operate without electricity service, and we must have plans in place to restore power to our grid.
Today I chaired an ENR hearing on #blackstart, which is process of restoring energy to the power grid after a system-wide blackout. The US has never seen a blackout of this kind, where everyone living within an interconnected electrical system loses power. https://t.co/zXqA5Wsqq1
Healthy oceans are vital to a healthy economy &amp; all aspects of our lives. Thanks @SenDanSullivan &amp; @SenWhitehouse for their work to address the global marine debris issue as their legislation the Save Our Seas Act was signed into law today.
Much of rural Alaska still lacks access to broadband internet service. The FCC needs to do better to reach tribal populations. Establishing broadband infrastructure will enhance the lives of Native Alaskans &amp; also advance safe/environmentally responsible maritime activity.
During an @IndianCommittee hearing we examined Government Accountability Office re: broadband internet availability on tribal lands. The GAO found that less than 1% of FCC &amp; about 14% of Rural Utility Service funding went to tribes &amp; tribally-owned providers—unacceptably low. https://t.co/vAK2ItTJD6
These short-term plans are helpful for a state like Alaska where our employment base is very seasonal. For Alaskans in the tourism, construction, or fishing industries, flexibility in duration of coverage is so important.
About 18,000 Alaskans are enrolled on the individual exchange &amp; roughly 15,000 have chosen to pay the individual mandate penalty rather than purchase insurance because it is too expensive. Short-term plans are a viable &amp; affordable option.
I spoke on the Senate Floor why I opposed an effort in the Senate to overturn a Trump Admin rule expanding the time that consumers can keep short-term health insurance plans. Alaskans need that flexibility in duration of coverage. https://t.co/ACw8Rhv5Ym
This is great news for our state as it ensures Alaskans won’t be taxing our own salmon products as they return to the U.S. for domestic consumption. 	 https://t.co/oTxu9zGcaR
I commend the @USTradeRep on their announcement that certain AK salmon will be excluded from the list of seafood imports subject to tariffs, allowing AK seafood producers who send salmon to China for limited processing to reimport those products to the U.S., tariff-free.
I have been concerned about the impact that China’s tariffs on American seafood will have on Alaska’s economy and urged President Trump to work towards a trade policy with China that protects these critical markets for our seafood industry.
The hydropower-related provisions will help streamline the permitting process, reduce costs, and allow for the continued consideration of the Mahoney Lake project. I’m proud of our work on this bill and look forward to the president signing it into law.
America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 will provide safe drinking water for our communities &amp; invest in needed water infrastructure, ranging from ports to water storage, in Alaska &amp; across our country.
Working closely with leaders on the Senate Committee on Environment &amp; Public Works, including @SenDanSullivan, and @HouseCommerce I was able to secure a number of water infrastructure &amp; hydropower-related provisions that will benefit AK. https://t.co/sIqEgphBxm
Today the Senate passed America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 with strong, bipartisan support. #WRDA https://t.co/HsJEooH7L6

The Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee advanced the Alaska Native Veterans Land Allotment Equity Act. This will help ensure that Alaska Natives who left home to serve during the Vietnam War are finally able to receive their land allotments.
The importance of the FAA Reauthorization bill cannot be understated. Aviation isn’t just a means of transportation for Alaskans – it means food deliveries, access to medical treatment, and basic necessities. Aviation is truly a lifeline in Alaska. https://t.co/yLzS6GnFxe
Today the Senate passed a 5-year FAA Reauthorization bill, which enhances security at airports, improves safety measures, makes travel easier for passengers, reauthorizes the Essential Air Service-- vital to so many of our communities. https://t.co/2RPVMj0fPJ
We also advanced several measures important to Alaska. Our ability to report these measures, almost always in a #bipartisan manner, is a reflection of the significant time that members and staff alike have devoted to them. https://t.co/FSkslOLyZz
Yesterday I chaired an Energy Committee business meeting where we advanced 40 bills to the Senate Floor. Among them was the #RestoreOurParks Act, that will help ensure these ‘crown jewels’ and the historic sites within them can be enjoyed by future generations.
Tara’s new position as Assistant Secretary is vital to Alaska Native communities and to Indian Country, so it gives me great pride to have an Alaskan serving in this capacity. Congratulations, Tara—I look forward to seeing all you will accomplish!

Alaska is the most seismically active state in the nation, and this bill will ensure that communities in Alaska and across the country have the most advanced tools to better prepare for and protect lives from significant earthquakes.	https://t.co/hrX3RcMxO7
Last week the Senate passed the bipartisan bill I introduced w/ @SenFeinstein to reauthorize the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.

The Port of Alaska, previously known as the Port of Anchorage, is a lifeline to our state, handling more than 3.5 million tons of building materials, food, fuel and other materials to Alaskans each year. https://t.co/xlJSHjSsnx
Glad to meet with Col. Phillip Borders, recently named the 28th Commander of the Army Corps of Engineers Alaska District. I appreciate the good work of the Army Corps of Engineers on so many important projects for Alaska. https://t.co/6jFk98bL7d
Proud this bill was included in the recently passed Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, which will help fight the opioid crisis impacting our country. https://t.co/gjMjiTxgLA
In May, I introduced the National Milestones to Measure Progress in Ending the Opioid Epidemic Act, w/ @SenMarkey which requires the federal government to set benchmarks for how it is addressing the opioid crisis in and by measuring progress on key objectives each year.
Year after year Alaska tops the charts with having some of the highest suicide rates in the country. We know that one suicide is too many, and it has become far too prevalent in our Native communities. Together, we can give Alaskans the support they need and ultimately, hope. https://t.co/6HSak7Fsma
.@SenWarren &amp; I introduced the Native American Suicide Prevention Act. This bipartisan effort will ensure Native communities have a seat at the table in developing &amp; implementing statewide suicide intervention &amp; prevention strategies. https://t.co/dUFPEjUr7c
Pleased to see that 24 community health centers across Alaska will receive @HHSGov funding to help address the opioid epidemic. See the Alaska list here: https://t.co/ebglLc5joa https://t.co/ZIoyuDHWCT
Thanks to @SenRobPortman and my other Senate colleagues for all the work they have done to ensure opioids and other harmful drugs do not reach our communities through the mail.
One provision included in the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, the STOP Act, requires the U.S. Postal Service must include detailed descriptions on packages &amp; increase regulations on delivery,to help decrease the amount of illegal drugs transported by mail. https://t.co/QOeE98oeel
We know that across Alaska, opioids are getting into our communities and villages through the U.S. Postal Service, and our efforts cut off that flow have been limited.
During a Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions Committee hearing focused on reducing healthcare costs by making healthcare information on cost and quality more transparent, I spoke to the challenges in Alaska and the need to improve healthcare cost transparency. https://t.co/zyPQSTdXYM
In Alaska and the rest of the nation, patients rarely know the cost of medical services before receiving care, and costs can vary significantly depending on where one chooses to receive care.
Also included is legislation of mine with @SenDonnelly for a loan repayment program to help recruit/retain workers. These provisions will help address this epidemic by getting to the heart of how we provide for that level of care. https://t.co/TFuHRTOG8n
One measure of mine w/ @SenTinaSmith included in the opioid package was the Improving Access to Mental Health Services Act, which will allow greater flexibility for trained professionals to serve in schools and communities. https://t.co/0i856tOzgQ
In Alaska, one of the difficulties we face in addressing the opioid crisis is the shortage of healthcare workers and professional help. Within the recently passed Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, I secured provisions to help address the workforce shortage in Alaska. https://t.co/luvB7WDZbJ
It will bolster our defense capabilities by modernizing existing facilities, strengthening training &amp; emphasizing importance of developing Alaska’s strategic military presence in the Arctic. This bill is significant to the economic prosperity &amp; security of our nation &amp; Alaska.
This bill invests in Alaskan futures by directing funds to programs that will support high-quality, locally-led job training and education initiatives.
The Senate passed a funding pkg that includes the largest pay raise for troops in nearly a decade, funding for a new national firefighter cancer registry, and support for high quality educational opportunities for Alaskans of all ages---just to name a few. https://t.co/G4XRPOtwmB
This all-encompassing bill package, addresses prevention, treatment, recovery, &amp; long-term support. From cutting off the flow of illegal drugs to improving access to treatment- it’s time to break the stigma, care for our communities, and turn the tide of this epidemic. https://t.co/3tD5mijGHA
The opioid epidemic has wreaked havoc across our nation and in my home state of Alaska—and it isn’t just impacting the lives of substance abusers. This is a problem that consumes all ages, all spectrums, and all classes. Addiction knows no boundaries. https://t.co/yZT5D6VgnB
Last night the Senate passed the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018 by a 99-1 vote. This bipartisan package was developed through combining the proposals of over 70 senators and work by five committees- truly landmark legislation. https://t.co/qzxAk9Jl2A
The bill ends the practice of concealing prices from patients by prohibiting the use of “gag clauses,” which have banned pharmacists from telling patients when it's cheaper to buy a prescription drug without using their insurance.
Tonight the Senate passed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act, a bill I proudly cosponsored to increase transparency regarding prescription drug prices. https://t.co/pYLt0SLB3L
Addressing the high cost of healthcare in Alaska remains a priority of mine. One component of addressing those challenges is improving transparency across the board--- from the cost of medical procedures to the price of prescription drugs.
https://t.co/SNzjcbbc1w
My heartfelt thanks go out to the members of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, who play a central role in safeguarding the sustainable and enduring health of our bowhead whale populations, and to the members of the United States delegation. https://t.co/6ye2eS0KKa
The importance of subsistence for the food security &amp; cultural vitality of Arctic communities cannot be understated. Recently at the 67th meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission’s (AEWC) bowhead whale harvest quota was approved.
According to the International Energy Agency, imports to Europe are expected to rise almost 20 percent by 2040. With the abundance of our domestic natural gas supplies, the United States is poised to change that equation and provide our allies a greater level of energy security.
I chaired an Energy Committee hearing on the economic &amp; geopolitical implications of a stronger U.S.–EU energy relationship. As we've often seen, Russia has used its much-needed natural gas resource as a geopolitical weapon, being the main supplier for reliant European nations. https://t.co/34uTFHFToS

Hammond was a decorated World War II Marine Corps fighter pilot &amp; was one of Alaska’s great statesmen, dedicating his life to public service. Renaming the wilderness portion of @LakeClarkNPS as the Jay S. Hammond Wilderness Area is a fitting tribute to his life and legacy.
Proud that my bill designating 2.6 million acres of existing federal wilderness located within @LakeClarkNPS as the “Jay S. Hammond Wilderness” has become a reality. A fitting tribute for one of Alaska's great statesmen, former Gov. Hammond.  https://t.co/Ze5KPhQ9Dm
I’m proud of this bipartisan package that capitalizes on energy opportunities, increases innovation, and bolsters our nation’s defense capabilities --- all with Alaska’s unique needs and opportunities in mind.
The funding package invests in developing clean, diverse &amp; reliable energy and making home-heating &amp; energy costs more affordable for Alaskans. It prioritizes AK’s strategic military presence &amp; invests in the health &amp; well-being of AK's service members, veterans &amp; their families.
A funding package bill on Energy and Water; Military Construction-Veterans Affairs; and Legislative Branch for FY19 is headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law.  https://t.co/SHyhV39Xh7

During my speech I also addressed the progress we’ve made on the federal budget such as passing legislation which prioritizes programs that protect our water, people, and lands-- all significant progress to support Alaska’s tribal communities.
I spoke to tribal leaders at the Tribal Impact Unity Days meeting here in DC about work underway in the Senate, including an important comprehensive opioids package to prevent addiction and eliminate the flow of drugs into our villages and communities. https://t.co/bufK3ZEOWY
As our only operational coal mine in Alaska, Usibelli provides our state with 115 jobs and averages between 1.2 and 2 million tons of coal per year. I appreciate UCM for their 75 years of service- providing energy, jobs, and economic opportunity for Alaska.
Today I met w/ Usibelli Coal Mine to talk through a range of initiatives, including: the importance of coal for electric generation in the Interior, coal markets, New Source Review permits, the completion of UAF’s upgrades to its Combined Heat and Power Plant, and more. https://t.co/Vfd3pa00Ze

During the hearing, I also asked Nazak Nikakhtar, Assistant Secretary for Industry and Analysis at the ITA, to give more information on the trade strategy the International Trade Administration is developing regarding China and the U.S. seafood industry. https://t.co/651HjK3XpO
Alaska has some of the world’s most sustainable and productive wild fisheries, making the current uncertainties in the U.S. seafood industry a high priority. During a CJS Approps Cmte hearing, I expressed some of the concerns that are being raised by Alaskan stakeholders.
Our bipartisan bill will provide the tools, resources, and partnerships necessary to drive innovation in advanced reactors to restore our global leadership on nuclear technologies and create American jobs. #NELA2018

I often comment on the high cost of living in AK. But, I’m not sure people understand what these “high costs” look like on a practical level. In Savoonga, I compared costs for products to prices you might see in the lower 48- a staggering difference that adds up quick! https://t.co/qais8DMjsl
Great read on the value of the Community Health Aide Program, a network of Community Health Aides/Practitioners who serve as the frontline of healthcare in over 170 rural AK villages. As Interior Approps chairman, I'm proud to support this vital program. https://t.co/TeJ7aJpFtS
With the uncertainty of the outcome in the upcoming Texas v. United States case, this legislation is needed now more than ever to give Alaskans, and all Americans, the certainty they need that protections for those with pre-existing conditions will remain intact.
As I talk to Alaskans, healthcare remains a huge concern. One of the key pieces to care is ensuring that people with pre-existing conditions can purchase insurance. I’m proud to support a bill that will make sure no one loses coverage. https://t.co/r8VY7caeYf

When you hear the phrase “overcrowded home”, many might assume the biggest issues are discomfort and lack of rest due to limited beds and space; however, the ripple effect of an overcrowded home is so much further reaching. https://t.co/HvlfLfuBAb
Senator McCain penned a farewell letter to all Americans before his passing. Powerful doesn’t even begin to describe it. I encourage all Americans to read it. https://t.co/mSAbuhWIsS
While the living conditions of overcrowded homes were heartbreaking, we also had a chance to see some of the new homes being constructed-- just a fraction of what is needed but a positive step towards creating a healthier, happier future for the community of Savoonga. https://t.co/bRT2oOpIoA
It’s one thing to hear about multiple generations living together in a home, having to sleep in shifts due to a lack of beds and space, but it’s another to see it firsthand--- these stories are more than statistics. https://t.co/IOYtkym4Ku

It’s not uncommon for a household in rural Alaska to have multiple generations or multiple families living in them. The overcrowding rate in Bering Strait region is one of highest in AK w/ roughly 27% households classified as overcrowded. That’s more than 8.3 X national average.

This registry will track the health &amp; safety of men &amp; women who put their lives on the line in service of others, specifically to study the relationship w/ career-long exposure to dangerous toxins &amp; fumes &amp; the frequency of cancer in firefighters to determine if there's a link.
I very proud that the funding package supporting defense, health, labor and education, which recently passed the Senate, included funding I advocated for to start-up the National Firefighter Cancer Registry. https://t.co/3nNJzcSmri
John McCain has shown us all how to live each day with courage, passion and determination. He has faced his cancer in just that same way. My prayers are with John and his family.
As we work to develop Alaska’s economic opportunities, it’s important that we put the right systems in place to prepare Alaskans to fill those good Alaskan jobs.
Among many priorities for Alaska, I’m proud this package includes funding to support locally-led, high quality educational and job training opportunities for Alaskans of all ages.

I’m proud my Interior bill includes support for AK to develop/enhance earthquake monitoring capabilities, build upon increases for the volcano hazards program, &amp; fully fund the 10-yr avg cost of our nation’s wildfire suppression needs. https://t.co/84IojIR2e6
On August 12th a small airplane crashed at an airstrip near the town of Delta Junction. Thankfully, the 2 people involved in the crash have both been rescued by the Alaska Air National Guard. Thank you to the brave men &amp; women who helped in rescue efforts https://t.co/z787iMiBmd
In Southeast Alaska, shipbuilding is a bright spot in the region, offering good, skilled jobs &amp; supporting our state’s valuable maritime industry. @ComdtUSCG &amp; I recently toured the Vigor Alaska Ketchikan Shipyard. Amazing to see behind-the-scenes of a growing industry in Alaska. https://t.co/parMG42YK1
Great to see the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) signed into law. This legislation provides a much-needed pay raise for our troops &amp; ensures our men &amp; women in uniform have the training &amp; tools they need to keep America safe &amp; secure. https://t.co/IKIPYUwmJq
It was a good opportunity catch up with these small brewing co. owners to gain insight on how things are going for local businesses, hear their concerns over the impacts of steel &amp; aluminum tariffs, as well as benefits from the tax reform bill cutting their excise tax in half. https://t.co/XCwNKUibdJ
As co-chair of the Senate Small Brewers Caucus, I make it a point to visit our small brewers in Alaska. I recently visited @baranofbrew in Sitka &amp; the newly opened Bawden St. Brewing Co. in Ketchikan. A common theme --their contribution to the local economy &amp; community pride. https://t.co/SATOatkE31
Good news for Alaskans in the Juneau area--- because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which became law last December, AEL&amp;P saw significant savings in their tax expense and is passing that along to its customers by cutting electric rates by 6.73 percent. https://t.co/yvVtQejfSG
OceansAlaska is leading the way in Southeast for mariculture efforts. While I was in Ketchikan, I had the opportunity to visit the marine science center and shellfish hatchery and see some of their operations firsthand, such as maturing oysters from seedlings. https://t.co/nl7jmQV3A8
I appreciate you taking the time to visit Alaska and for all the @USCG does for our state! https://t.co/kDHd5wZdIN
Thank you also @usairforce Secretary Heather Wilson for visiting servicemen and woman at Joint Base Elemendorf-Richardson--- to see firsthand the operations in Alaska, which will soon host both of the Air Force’s modern stealth fighters. https://t.co/JivLgl3Ms7
Proud to have @USArmy Secretary Mark Esper make the trip to Alaska recently to meet with soldiers at Ft. Wainwright and Ft. Richardson. Thanks to Sec. Esper for visiting the Army’s bases in Alaska and understanding the strategic importance Alaska plays in our nation’s security. https://t.co/FOOyBEfmqk
I was honored to be in Ketchikan for the christening of the first state ferry to be built in Alaska, by Alaskans. The Tazlina, meaning “swift river” in Athabascan, is truly a state-of-the-art vessel. (1 of 2) https://t.co/zY531F2Pzh
This is the first of a new fleet of ferries that will provide safe, efficient marine transportation throughout coastal Alaska for generations to come. (2 of 2) https://t.co/B6ZY8aUU2Y

Great to visit to crews &amp; assets stationed in Petersburg w/ US @USCG Commandant Admiral Shultz &amp; 17th CG District Commander Admiral Bell. This gave me the opportunity to highlight the importance of CG to the community &amp; for the health/safety of its large commercial fishing fleet. https://t.co/HKmhjYP0mG
In talking to the crew of the USCGC John F. McCormick, it was great to hear firsthand their love for this ship —from the advanced technology to the boat operations allowing them to operate safer and quicker. I agree with Admiral Shultz this ship is going to be game changing in AK https://t.co/Wuw1cfabga
The @USCG  Commandant Admiral Shultz &amp; I toured one of the Coast Guard’s newest vessels —USCGC John F. McCormick— a Fast Response Cutter homeported in Ketchikan.  (1 of 2) https://t.co/OPVYaoCTnt
It was an honor to host the Commandant of the @USCG in Alaska. Admiral Karl Schultz was able to meet men &amp; women serving in Alaska, who ensure the safety and security of Alaska waters. Extremely valuable to see Coast Guard assets and operations here in Southeast Alaska. https://t.co/Zwy1wD56ec

I loved the chance to tour the Sitka National Historical Park museum and see the partnership between the Sitka Tribe and @NatlParkService. Preserving our history and sharing the story of the people that have been part of these lands for centuries is so important. https://t.co/fQdEW7qJAv
Great story and project all around —the Tongass Tiny Home is being built by students in a Sitka H.S. construction class, using local materials such as wood from the Tongass National Forest. A wonderful example of buying local and responsibly utilizing our sustainable resources. https://t.co/79lAUTquH7
I visited Sitka National Historical Park and was pleased to see the recently constructed Indian River pedestrian bridge, which replaced a 50-year-old bridge that was in a state of disrepair — just one example of the importance of upkeep in our national parks. https://t.co/322os2JI1b

Congrats to the Usibelli family for 75 yrs of operating and producing the world's cleanest coal in Healy, Alaska! Usibelli Coal Mine’s pioneering spirit has employed hundreds of 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th generation Alaskans and is a great example of what responsible mining in AK looks like. https://t.co/N7vVLff2cj
I’m pleased that my bill prioritizes Alaska’s unique needs and helps ensure a safer, healthier environment for all Alaskans. https://t.co/9ZgvsCUi5W
Among many Alaska initiatives, my interior bill includes funding to bring basic water and sewer systems to communities in rural parts of our state, provides increased support for Targeted Airshed Grants, and prohibits the EPA from shutting down small, remote incinerators.
In Alaska we strive to collaborate with the EPA on their core mission to ensure clean air, land, and water while ensuring that our potential is not squandered by overly burdensome, unnecessary regulations. My Interior bill makes progress in striking that healthy balance.
Reminder- my staff has a booth set up at the Tanana Valley State Fair. I encourage everyone in the area to stop by and say hello! https://t.co/8U95e0p1Tr
Happy birthday @uscg - Thank you for 228 years of service and for all you do for the great state of Alaska. #SemperParatus https://t.co/ozr2x6TWV9
This Act will award Congress’s highest honor to Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, &amp; Dr. Christine Darden, 4 black women who served as mathematicians, programmers, and engineers at NASA at the infancy of the Space age when the agency was emerging from segregation.

Census data helps ensure fair allocations of funding for federal programs that are vital to Native communities, including housing, healthcare, and education. Unfortunately, getting accurate Census data in rural Alaska and throughout Indian Country is no simple task.
Census data is incredibly significant to Alaska Natives as it’s used by Tribes and Tribal Organizations to make informed decisions about the future of their people.
This week, alongside @SenatorHeitkamp  and Senator @amyklobuchar , I requested information on the Census Bureau’s plan to ensure an accurate and cost-effective 2020 Census count in tribal communities. https://t.co/aItFPrA6o7
I appreciate the work done by Secretary Perdue for recognizing the need for economic relief in these communities, and look forward to continuing to work with the administration, state officials, Sen. Sullivan, and Congressman Young to see this process through to the finish line.
Yesterday the State of Alaska and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to officially initiate the rulemaking process to develop an Alaska-specific Roadless Rule, ensuring greater access to our national forests.
The Roadless Rule has never made sense in Alaska. This announcement will help put us on a path to ensure the Tongass is once again a working forest and a multiple use forest for all who live in southeast. https://t.co/oO21qvRNEe
For many in Alaska, air travel is simply a way of life. With over 80 percent of our communities not accessible by road, flying connects people and communities. My interior bill provides significant and necessary investments to help safeguard our pilots and Alaskan communities.
We know that in Alaska, air travel isn’t just a means of transportation- it’s a lifeline. I’m proud that my Interior bill includes $7.7 million for Alaska mapping initiatives that will help gather data to improve maps, enhancing the safety of activities such as aviation. https://t.co/gmxENnLGhN
My Interior bill increases funding for @forestservice recreation activities, including upkeep of cabins &amp; trails, and provides more resources for permitting programs that will allow more businesses to operate in Alaska’s national forests. https://t.co/2ZeduLVjeA
My Interior funding bill is all about protecting water, people &amp; our lands. It includes funding for infrastructure improvements &amp; deferred maintenance on our public lands. From @GatesArcticNPS to @DenaliNPS &amp; more --maintaining our parks is key for local visitors &amp; our tourism.
Our national security must always remain a top priority. Thanks to @SenDanSullivan for his work in helping to craft a bill that pushes the Defense Dept. toward a more robust Arctic strategy &amp; expanding military presence in Alaska to further strengthen our defense capabilities.
This bill strongly supports the work of the Missile Defense Agency, includes a pay raise for our service members, bolsters our military’s cold weather capabilities, and sends a firm signal that Congress expects to see the construction of six new polar icebreakers.
Yesterday, the Senate passed the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), legislation to help ensure our men and women of the military have the training, resources, and tools they need to defend our nation. https://t.co/CjIN80BC9v
The bill also funds a new grant program to help bring basic water &amp; sewer to communities in need. The impact these resources will have to our rural communities– and for public health– cannot be understated.
Far too many communities across Alaska lack access to safe, clean water. My Interior bill which just passed the Senate provides funding to improve wastewater &amp; drinking water systems. https://t.co/gQIkd47yet
I’m encouraged that this bill, which passed with a strong, bipartisan vote of 92-6, will create opportunities for Alaskans to grow our economy and create safer and healthier communities.  https://t.co/BhGobWqQq3
My Interior Environment Approps bill for FY19 contained in a funding package, passed the Senate today. This is the 1st time in nearly a decade that the Interior bill was considered on the Senate floor, including final passage- an important milestone that I was proud to lead.
As a member of the Approps Cmte &amp; Chair of the Interior-Environment Approps Subcmte, I’m proud to have secured funding in the bill to further develop AK's transportation &amp; housing infrastructure, protect our land &amp; water, &amp; improve the safety, health &amp; well-being of Alaskans.
In a 92-6 vote, the Senate passed a funding package containing 4 FY19 funding bills. I’m proud these bills will create opportunities for Alaskans &amp; I'm equally proud that the progress we’ve made to advance these bills was done in a bipartisan manner.  https://t.co/bTEVkeW3Cy
Thanks to Interior Appropriations subcmte Ranking Member @SenatorTomUdall for helping shape this Interior-Environment bill to reflect priorities of members on both sides of the aisle. I look forward to passage of this bill.
My Interior bill does right by Indian Country, restoring proposed cuts of over a billion dollars in critical funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs &amp; Indian Health Service- including funding to help combat the opioid crisis &amp; improve healthcare for Alaska Natives.
I’m proud of the provisions in my Interior bill, such as full funding for the PILT program, maintaining funding for the LWCF program &amp; robust funding for wildfire prevention and suppression efforts--to ensure crews have the resources they need.
As Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I’m proud that my FY19 Interior-Environment Appropriations bill was brought before the full Senate for consideration- the 1st time that the Interior bill has done so since FY10. Passing this bill would be a real milestone.
This critical 4-bill funding package represents the commitment that both sides have made to create an environment where we can work through tough issues on appropriations bills in a bipartisan fashion.
This funding package includes 4 bills: Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development; Financial Services &amp; General Government; Agriculture, Rural Development, &amp; FDA; &amp; my Interior-Environment Appropriations bill.

I met with the AK Coalition on Housing &amp; Homelessness (AKCH2) to discuss overcrowded homes in rural communities, our lack of affordable housing, the high number of homeless veterans, &amp; the need for improved infrastructure across AK. Thanks to AKCH2 for their continued advocacy. https://t.co/xzwDjSyaME
In recent years, Alaska had been making good progress with China in developing a stronger, more balanced trade relationship, so the recently imposed seafood tariffs have understandably rattled our state.
The seafood industry is Alaska’s number one private industry in terms of the jobs and the economic opportunity it brings. Approximately 40% of our salmon exports, 54% of our cod exports, and a significant portion of our shellfish were imported to China just last year.
During a Commerce, Justice, Science Approps hearing, I asked Robert E. Lighthizer, Ambassador of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, what assurances he could give for the future of the seafood industry- for the sake of our fishermen, our processors &amp; the state of AK. https://t.co/7yALhrZdP5

Today, in light of Soldotna gearing up to celebrate Progress Days and honor Marge with her very own “Marge Mullen Appreciation Day”, I spoke on the Senate floor to offer my deepest thanks and best wishes to Marge as she continues to influence her community and that state of AK.
Marge Mullen became the first official female homesteader in Soldotna, AK after moving there in 1947. Now 98 years old, she is revered as the town’s unofficial historian, bringing the early days of Soldotna to light through her teachings &amp; digital lessons. https://t.co/iujTRW4GRA
Today the Senate HELP Committee approved the 'Patient’s Right to Know Drug Prices Act', legislation I cosponsored, which prohibits health insurers &amp; pharmacy managers from misleading patients on drug prices. https://t.co/Ghj2qjcUwI
Proud to have worked closely with AK stakeholders &amp; my colleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to make Perkins more reflective of local needs to ensure we have the systems &amp; resources in place to train more Alaskans for good Alaskan jobs.
This legislation has played a part in helping school districts and the University of Alaska system prepare Alaskans for jobs in construction, health services, office management, and elsewhere.
Recently, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to reauthorize the Carl Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, a law crucial to helping our nation’s students obtain skills to be successful in today’s workplace. https://t.co/yI8Kz9RuTp
There is simply no substitute for U.S. production, for as long as we need it, even as we seek to diversify away from oil. That’s why I believe it was the right move to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR to responsible development. #EnergySecurity is #NationalSecurity
Global oil demand is rising, not falling. Our best course is to continue with our efforts to produce more oil here at home. As we produce more, we are creating #jobs, generating revenues, and bringing a degree of #stability and confidence to global markets.
This year has been marked by greater volatility in global oil prices, which has shown up in the prices being paid at the pump by nearly every American family and business. Today I led an Energy hearing to receive testimony on why this is and what lies ahead. https://t.co/btBinxclNI
I urge the President to take a broader view of the impacts his trade policy is having and recognize that trade assistance is no substitute for trade itself.
The administration’s announcement of $12 billion in aid is an admission that tariffs are hurting, not helping, our country. Yet, farmers are hardly the only ones caught in the crossfire -- so, too, are our fishermen, the energy industry, and many others. https://t.co/H2TEKcw2fL
This week I’m proud to manage on the Senate floor an appropriations bill package where all members of the Senate have an opportunity to debate appropriations bills and offer amendments. This is the way government should work. https://t.co/0K7X38xAJv
I have long believed that its crucial the Senate should return to regular order, where we vote appropriations bills out of committee w/ bipartisan support and bring them to the Senate floor. Proud we are at that point. https://t.co/t5ZEYQ60C3
This is the first time that the Interior bill has been before the full Senate since FY 2010.  I worked with my Ranking Member of the subcommittee, @SenatorTomUdall to shape this bill so that it reflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle. https://t.co/AslyZQ3xJt
These funding bills have all passed out of the full Appropriations Committee with strong bipartisan support ---which shows the commitment that both sides have made to create an environment where we can work through tough issues in a bipartisan fashion.
As chairman of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, I was selected to manage this package of bills on the Senate floor. I’m honored as these are important bills and look forward to working through this process with all of my colleagues.
Last night the Senate moved to consideration on an appropriations (government funding bill) package that includes the following 4 FY19 bills: my Interior-Environment bill; Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development. https://t.co/ZO5oS6kyYt
I am confident that Mr. Wilkie will use his previous knowledge of Capitol Hill, the Pentagon, and the VA to build upon the momentum that has been created by Congress in these recent months to secure greater care and support for our nation’s heroes. https://t.co/sbChtheW6G
Congrats to Robert L. Wilkie on being confirmed as Secretary of Veterans Affairs with overwhelming bipartisan support. Because Alaska has more veterans per capita than any other state in the U.S., it is especially important that we have the right individual to lead the VA.
Whether it’s developing drinking water &amp; wastewater systems for communities in need, helping protect Alaska’s lands from wildfires, or investing in the health and wellness of Alaskans, this legislation provides significant investments for my state and nation.
As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee, I’m proud to announce that my FY19 Interior Appropriations bill has reached the Senate floor for consideration, for the first times since FY 2010.  https://t.co/YgzEVUus60

We must work to identify where harassment is its most pervasive; where it has been allowed to foster in a culture of silence, disrespect, intimidation, and abuse. And we must #empower victims to speak out.
The #EMPOWERAct works to curb workplace harassment and increase transparency and accountability.

By delaying the implementation of the EVV system, we are giving Alaskans enough time to set up a system that will effectively serve our state.
The EVV system requires providers to check in and check out electronically to ensure Medicaid is not being over-billed. It has the potential to greatly improve the health &amp; welfare of patients by validating delivery &amp; billing of services, while reducing potential waste &amp; fraud.
Proud my bill is on its way to the President’s desk to be signed into law, which will ensure Alaskans have adequate time to thoughtfully develop an effective Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) system. https://t.co/IMa8dyfzFO

Today I chaired an ENR hearing on the Dept. of the @Interior’s final list of critical minerals for 2018, and to examine our nation’s mineral security.

I remain committed to ensuring the proper training and resources are available for medical providers, so that survivors can seek redress and receive the justice they deserve
This bill will direct HHS to expand access to medical forensic exams of sexual assault by developing federal standards around examinations &amp; treatment, expand training &amp; services for providers, &amp; create a national sexual assault taskforce.
Survivors of sexual assault domestic violence need to have reliable access to medical forensic exams and support. I joined @PattyMurray on a bipartisan bill to increase access to forensic exams and care for survivors. https://t.co/3mlOZuvYg6

I'm proud to stand up for victims of sexual assault, alongside @PattyMurray, by introducing the Survivors’ Access to Supportive Care Act, to provide to provide states &amp; hospitals w/ necessary training &amp; resources so victims can receive the support &amp; justice they need and deserve.
More often than not sexual assault survivors in Alaska aren’t able to seek justice against their perpetrator, because they are unable to gather the evidence after the assault due to lack of trained individuals to help collect that forensic evidence. https://t.co/7MW5DDGXkE
The Firefighter Cancer Registry Act supports important research into what causes cancer among our nation’s bravest as well as potential prevention strategies. I'm hopeful that the data gathered through this law will help improve safety for paid &amp; unpaid firefighters, nationwide.

I’m proud that the Micro-Grants for Food Security program, a provision I authored, was included in the recently passed Farm Bill. This provision will create a new grant to support Alaskans’ ability to grow their own food in their own backyards.

The importance of icebreakers increases as sea ice diminishes &amp; marine traffic increases, especially since the Arctic is becoming increasingly desirable for exploration of oil, gas &amp; minerals. Our country needs a fleet of icebreakers to adequately meet Arctic mission demands.
I'm pleased that full funding for the design/construction of the 1st heavy polar icebreaker was included in Senate Approps Cmte’s Homeland Security FY19 bill since 3 countries announced their commitment to building new icebreakers (China, Canada, &amp; Norway) https://t.co/A6mZThnNIY

Historically, our nation’s farm bills have not supported the unique agricultural needs of our state, so my bill will address many of those unique challenges and opportunities, ensuring Alaskan families are strong, healthy, and never hungry.
In Alaska our waters are often our farms. I'm proud my bill recognizes fishermen as ranchers of the sea &amp; requires FDA to mandate labeling of genetically engineered salmon to protect our wild salmon &amp; ensure consumers know what they’re feeding their families. #SayNoToFrankenfish
My bill increases food security, maintains conservation efforts, expands opportunities for trade, improves rural development, and bolsters research initiatives, all while encouraging local agriculture, and supporting Alaska’s fishermen, farmers, and herders.

While there are many unknowns as to the impacts of these newly announced tariffs, I urge President Trump to work towards a trade policy with China that protects these critical markets for our seafood industry.
Alaska is proud to produce high quality, delicious, and sustainably harvested seafood products. It’s imperative that our seafood industry, one of the economic drivers of our state, has the ability to continue competitively exporting their products all over the world.
I'm very concerned about the impact that China’s tariffs on American seafood will have on Alaska’s economy. In 2017 alone, Alaska seafood exports were worth $3.45 billion w/ nearly $1 billion was exported to China.

We have worked so hard to put a plan in place to refill TAPS for another 40 years. Our state’s strong record of environmental protection and technological improvements will help ensure Alaska’s resources are produced safely.
We had no greater victory over the past yr than in our fight to open the Coastal Plain of ANWR. We recognize that Alaska needs to be able to develop the resources in the NPR-A, offshore &amp; Coastal Plain. We need the jobs, revenues &amp; security that new production will provide.
Almost a year ago @SecretaryZinke traveled to Alaska and promised Alaskans that in this administration the path to energy dominance would start with Alaska. Today @AOGA conference, I shared an update on the very real progress being made. https://t.co/gyEIEW5H6O

Our geography, our climate, and our people have made Alaska a world leader on innovation. #AKNatLabDay https://t.co/S24eyBvdvQ
Because Alaska has every type of renewable, from hydropower to wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass, dozens of those remote villages are adding renewables to their microgrids to help cut costs and emissions.
In Alaska, about 200 of our rural villages are completely disconnected from a traditional grid and rely on expensive diesel generation that is barged in or flown in once or twice a year.
Alaska is truly a living laboratory. I kicked off Alaska National Lab Day this morning at @uafairbanks -- speaking to how our challenges and unique opportunities will help us find great innovative solutions.#AKNatLabDay https://t.co/b75Fbzmx1a

We must always honor &amp; never forget the many who have died to protect our freedom. Memorial Day should not be a day marked by sorrow but by sincere tribute and appreciation of the service of those we’ve lost, the nation they protected – and all it stands for.
I ask us all to keep in perspective what Memorial Day is truly about: honoring the dedication of those who have served and sacrificed for our country. #MemorialDay https://t.co/hpNZJ7ivWl

If we as members of Congress are going to change the culture of harassment nationwide, we must lead by example. This legislation guarantees that we are doing all we can to strengthen our own procedures in place to ensure everyone has a safe and protected workplace.
There’s one thing we should all agree on – every workplace should be safe for employees, as everyone deserves to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination.
Proud legislation I cosponsored passed the Senate today that would overhaul the current reporting process for victims of harassment and discrimination, as well as require Congressional members found liable to pay settlements out of their own pocket. https://t.co/M0Z7luQMj2

Our bill, the National Volcano Early Warning &amp; Monitoring System Act also creates a Volcano Watch Office that will operate 24-hours a day, seven days a week, to provide continuous situational awareness of all active volcanoes in the U.S. and its territories.
Proud the Senate passed a bill of mine, @SenatorCantwell &amp; @maziehirono, ensuring @USGS has proper resources to strengthen our monitoring, warning &amp; response capabilities. By improving our volcano monitoring &amp; early warning capabilities, we can help keep communities safe.
Volcanic eruptions, like the one in Hawaii and the one earlier this month at Cleveland Volcano in Alaska, are vivid reminders of why it is so critical to have continuous and reliable monitoring systems. https://t.co/yRvrekKD7J
During an Interior Appropriations subcommittee hearing, I questioned Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt for commit to find a workable solution to this uniquely Alaskan dilemma. #OnlyInAlaska https://t.co/bxJWqOvqrU
Many of Alaska's rural areas are inaccessible by road, so one of the only options other than using small, remote incinerators is to use a helicopter to dispose of solid waste. If we are really focused on lowering our levels of emissions, using helicopters defeats the purpose.

Instead of seeing articles on efforts to return EPA to its core mission I'm reading about Pruitt's interactions w/ reps of industries he regulates, for example. Some are undoubtedly a result of the 'gotcha' age, but there are also legitimate questions that need to be answered.
During an Interior Approps hearing on EPA budget, I told Pruitt I’m concerned these important policy efforts are being overshadowed because of a series of issues related to him and his management of the Agency.
I’m pleased @EPA is reversing course on actions taken by previous admin that clearly stepped far beyond the bounds of what was intended when statutes were written: efforts to rewrite WOTUS, a common-sense approach to use of small, remote incinerators &amp; avoiding duplicate regs.
@EPAScottPruitt has said that he is working to return the @EPA to its core mission of ensuring clean water, clean air, and clean land. He has also stated a desire to treat states as equal partners rather than as adversaries and has promoted a cooperative federalism approach.
Right now, I’m chairing an Interior Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to review the FY19 budget request for the @EPA w/ @EPAScottPruitt testifying. Watch live: https://t.co/49vQiCbUUm

Wonderful turnout from Alaskans at the @IndianCommittee nomination hearing for Tara Sweeney to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior. I'm bursting with pride. https://t.co/8shauyxPcJ
Tara holds so much hope and promise, not only for the people in her region, but also Alaska Natives around the state &amp; Indian Country as a whole. Tara is a strong, female Native leader, ready to take charge.
Tara Sweeney is qualified for this position &amp; is going to be the person to challenge the status quo for everyone in Indian Country. This nom is a critical step by the administration. Let's make history by confirming the first Alaska Native to this position.
As AFN Co-Chair, Tara sought to be inclusive &amp; transparent in an organization that's had many differing opinions &amp; views. But with her sense of purpose and determination, she worked collaboratively to improve the common goal of bettering the lives of the Alaska Native people.
I would like extend my congratulations &amp; full support to Tara Sweeney. The position she has been nominated for is one of tremendous importance to the members of @IndianCommittee &amp; to Indian Country as a whole.
Momentarily I’ll be joining the Senate @IndianCommittee for a hearing to consider Tara Sweeney of Alaska to be Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Interior. Watch live here: https://t.co/qoSq7Ui6DL

What’s truly remarkable is how Kodiak's carefully crafted renewables system allows their grid to handle the high demand for energy during fishing season while being able to adjust for the much lower demand in the off-season. https://t.co/iG9J3aZUvj
In Kodiak @SecretaryPerry &amp; I took a first-hand look at some of the innovation taking place w/ renewables in Alaska. Hydropower, wind turbines, batteries &amp; flywheels generate almost 98% of Kodiak's electricity. The result: 13M gallons of diesel fuel saved equals $40M in savings. https://t.co/zej2CLyElp

These scenarios are part of the reason why we are seeing innovation to bring costs down, often by adding locally available resources such as hydropower onto our microgrids. The challenge is immense, certainly. So is the opportunity for change.
AK paints an extreme picture of the energy challenges faced by many living in remote communities. Rural Alaskans pay more than twice as much to heat their homes than folks in the Lower 48, sometimes forcing them to choose between feeding their family or keeping them warm.

I’m concerned that it is becoming a safety issue for visitors, so we will need a plan to reroute the road—sooner than later, rather than just backfilling with gravel each year.
Today's Energy and Natural Resources hearing included good discussion on deferred maintenance in national parks.  Denali tops the list in AK for DM, but the most dangerous part, Polychrome Pass, doesn’t make the list.  It’s just now being studied.
The problem of deferred maintenance in our national parks has gone on for so long. Think of it like a homeowner --it's now the sink that no longer works because of a failure in the plumbing line, the carpet that has worn through to the subfloor &amp; the roof with gaping holes in it. https://t.co/P829qoS0b6
I believe our parks are worth protecting and welcome their contribution to our economy, but we also need to recognize this is a multi-faceted problem, that will take more than just federal dollars to resolve over the long-term.
As @NatlParkService moves into its 2nd century, the deferred maintenance backlog now at $11.6 billion, is one of the most significant challenges to its ability to provide quality visitor experiences. https://t.co/D4HUbFRYtH
Watch Live: I’m chairing an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing to examine deferred maintenance and operational needs of the National Park Service. 	https://t.co/bYQOCztJy3
@NativeFed @SecretaryZinke After a decades-long fight, I am so grateful to the community of King Cove for their persistence and to Secretary Zinke for recognizing that this decision was simply the right thing to do.
During the @NativeFed roundtable the AK Delegation &amp; @SecretaryZinke discussed the land-exchange agreement signed in January that allows for construction of a gravel, life-saving road connecting King Cove, AK to the all-weather airport in nearby Cold Bay. https://t.co/RV1xU2aYSP
And as we think about the significant challenges we have in front of us today, so much should be viewed through the lens of opportunities. We’ve made good progress but there’s still so much more to do.
Know that I am working alongside @repdonyoung and @SenDanSullivan to educate our nation about the uniqueness of Alaska and to ensure Alaska Natives receive the support they need and deserve.

For states like Alaska that have legalized marijuana, it’s important for law-abiding businesses to have access to safe financial services instead of forcing them to operate in all-cash, increasing a risk of crime and threatening public safety.

Our military families have enough to worry about as they defend our nation and shouldn't have to rely on food banks to help them put food on the table. Even as I work to ensure that our military families don’t need to rely on anti-hunger  programs, too many remain food insecure.

The ripple effect of a government shutdown has consequences for all Alaskans and most directly on the many federal employees and thousands more that rely on our federal agencies. These are real people and real families that are depending on us. Our responsibility is to govern.
It’s absolutely irresponsible to shut down the government. A Continuing Resolution is never ideal and is not the way to run a government, but this short-term fix is the best option we have in front of us, right now.

The passage of this #TaxReform a defining moment in our nation’s history. It’s been 31 years since we last reformed the tax code—and this bill comes not a moment too soon. It’s time we deliver relief, tax cuts, and good jobs for hard-working Americans.
The legislation includes a section of mine, which contains an important step in creating new economic opportunities by opening up the non-wilderness 1002 Area of ANWR for responsible energy development.
The Senate just passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, comprehensive #taxreform that reduces taxes and encourages the economic growth needed to create jobs and generate wealth.
It’s time to reform the tax code, for the good of our country.  And it’s time to open the non-wilderness 1002 Area to responsible development, for the benefit of all Alaskans and Americans.
I support tax reform.  And I’m also proud to be the lead author of our energy title, which contains the single-most important step we can take to strengthen our long-term energy security and create new wealth. #TaxReform #1002Area
To allow American corporations a more competitive edge and encourage jobs to return from oversees, the corporate rate is lowered to 21%—a move that is long overdue. #TaxReform

Bottom-line, this is a #taxform bill that works for Alaska &amp; this nation. It gets dollars in pockets &amp; relief to families. It restores competition in the global marketplace, certainty to job creators, and confidence that now is the time to invest in Alaska &amp; the rest of America.
This legislation will allow us to refill TAPS, which currently is just one-quarter full. This in turn will boost our local economy and reduce our nation’s foreign oil dependence.  #TaxReform
This tax bill authorizes responsible energy development in the 1002 Area, which covers land in the non-wilderness portion of ANWR in northeast Alaska.
99% of Alaskan businesses are small businesses, taxed at the individual rate. This bill allows owners of pass-through small businesses to deduct up to 20% of their business income from their taxes.
Lowering the corporate tax rate is a critical component of this tax legislation and will allow American businesses to compete against foreign competitors, and make the investments in American operations that will bring the jobs and economic growth that have eluded us for years.
The hallmark of this tax proposal is encouraging the growth we need in our economy to create jobs—the jobs that feed families, that put kids through college, and allow folks to build up their savings to cope with the unexpected. #TaxReform
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubles the standard deduction, resulting in a $12,000 deduction for single filers and $24,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.
This tax bill doubles the Child Tax Credit to $2,000 per child, a significant form of assistance to the 22 million Americans who use the Child Tax Credit. #TaxReform

Alaskans have repeatedly proven that we can develop safely and responsibly. Alaskans #ProtectTheArctic #EnergyIsGood #1002Area https://t.co/OX6zmlDsDe
We will balance the potential impacts of development, and that's why we have not avoided environmental reviews. We will not sacrifice wildlife for the sake of development. There is no question that development &amp; environmental protection can and do exist in Alaska.
The size of development pads has decreased by nearly 80% since the 1970s. New technologies have expanded the subsurface reach of the newest rigs by 4,000% over the same period. Many exploration wells are now built using ice roads and ice pads—leaving no impact to the tundra.
And while we can be confident in those benefits, we can be equally confident that none of this will come at the expense of our environment, because new technologies have left the footprint of development even smaller.
Revenues are not the only benefit that will result from careful development in the non-wilderness 1002 Area. We will also create thousands of good jobs that support families and help put kids through college.
The 1002 Area is separate from any wilderness. It is separate from the refuge itself. So when we talk about where the 1002 Area sits and how it sits as a function of ANWR, it’s important to keep that in mind.
I keep going back to the map of ANWR to remind colleagues that the 1002 Area was specifically set aside under ANILCA for consideration for oil and gas exploration.
CBO estimates that our legislation will raise more than $1 billion in federal revenues over the next 10 years.

I'm eager to work with a new administration to restore common sense &amp; resolve this horrible injustice for #KingCove. https://t.co/eqHQ1iZ6it
Life-saving road remains best &amp; only real option to help #KingCove have reliable access to medical transportation. https://t.co/eqHQ1iZ6it

With a new administration &amp; new Congress we have an opportunity to fix failures of #Obamacare, but a repeal and replace need to coincide.
I remain committed to repealing #Obamacare. I am equally committed to ensuring all Alaskans have access to affordable, quality healthcare.

And I oppose #WOTUS because it is yet another regulatory burden for Alaskans – on top of all the others. #DitchTheRule (4/4)
B/c #WOTUS could further dampen efforts to begin new resource extraction projects, which we depend on for the majority of AK's budget. (3/4)
Because Alaska is the only state that has permafrost, and we still have no idea whether those areas will be regulated under #WOTUS. (2/4)
I oppose #WOTUS because of the uncertainty it will create, the delays it will deliver, and the costs it will impose. (1/4)
#WOTUS would subject almost every project in AK to the federal permitting process. They'd cost more, take longer, be indefinitely delayed.

W/the countless threats facing our nation from all over the globe, I can’t believe the @POTUS would be willing to put our security at risk.
#NDAA was designed not only to keep this nation safe, but it also provides support for our troops, military retirees, and their families.
Our servicemembers &amp; their families deserve our unqualified support. They should never be used as a pawn in the President’s political game.
I think Alaskans would beg to differ. EPA’s overreach is stifling Alaska’s economy. https://t.co/LPwaRkNmSE
Deeply disappointed @POTUS vetoed #NDAA. Our natl. security &amp; support for troops shouldn't be jeopardized, esp. to make a political point.
Great to meet with @BillGates today! https://t.co/L7Jwth3fEb
Our servicemembers and their families need our unqualified support and should not be made pawns in a larger agenda. https://t.co/bPiGBq7Smu
Sen. Indian Affairs Committee unanimously passed leg. @SenDanSullivan &amp; I introduced to strengthen the 477 program. https://t.co/l6LaR7ErXW
While I have some concerns with this legislation, this issue is serious enough that we need to have a debate and opportunity for amendments.
This legislation, going after violent criminals, is a common sense solution to a serious problem and is essential to prevent similar crimes.
We also must seek justice for families like that of Kate Steinle, gunned down by a convicted felon who was also an illegal immigrant.
I voted to advance the #SanctuaryCities bill b/c we must have a conversation on protecting families from violent criminals here illegally.

There is not a lack of interest in the Arctic. If anything what we are seeing is a lack of interest in working w/ current DOI leadership.
It is absurd that Interior Dept. has created a regulatory environment where operators cannot have commercially viable exploration programs.
This is the latest in a destructive pattern of hostility toward energy production that began the 1st day this administration took office.
This is a stunning, short-sighted move that betrays the Interior Department’s commitments to Alaska. http://t.co/gFAhbr5CI2
