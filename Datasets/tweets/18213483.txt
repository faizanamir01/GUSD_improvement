When you delay legal abortion access to a raped 11-year-old girl, you are violating her basic human rights.
Even though she clearly met the criteria for legal abortion in #Argentina: 	• The pregnancy put her health at risk.	• The pregnancy was the result of a rape.

We know from court documents that @Shell &amp; government weren’t only afraid of losing access to Ogoni fields, but of protests spreading to new areas. @Shell was also concerned about Ogoni protestors cutting important pipeline that carried oil through Ogoniland from other areas.
These women are demanding damages for harm caused by Shell’s role in the arrest and execution of their husbands,  and a public apology for the role the company played.
“Over the years, @Shell has continually fought to make sure the this case is not heard in court. They have the resources to fight me instead of doing justice for my husband,” said Esther Kiobel.
Esther, Victoria, Blessing &amp; Charity are suing @Shell over what they say is its role in the unlawful arrest, detention &amp; execution of their husbands by the Nigerian military, following a brutal crackdown on Ogoni protests against Shell’s devastating pollution of the region.

An outrageous injustice!  		Days after #AmalFathy's release, an Egyptian court upheld her 2-year prison sentence. 		Instead of lashing out against critics, Egypt's authorities must quash Amal's conviction and drop all the charges against her. #W4R2018		https://t.co/oUoZ5XJO12

Bottom line: Mexico is not safe for people on the move looking for protection, and this new deal could be deadly. The US government must treat people with compassion, not contempt, and allow them to pursue safety inside the US.
In May, an LGBTI shelter on the Mx side of the border was attacked, robbed, &amp; set on fire. Attackers shouted homophobic slurs, threatening to kill everyone if they didn’t leave. “It seems like everybody wants to kill us,” the coordinator of the group in the shelter said.
We have documented many cases of violence against people waiting in Mexico before the US will hear their case. LGBTI folks and families are at particularly high risk. Read more in our latest report. https://t.co/pmfQlln6fI
In August 2018, the US @StateDept itself issued a statement advising against all travel to the Mexican side of the border in Tamaulipas State, due to kidnappings, murder, and other violence targeting civilians. 		Why is it suddenly safe enough for asylum seekers to wait there?
The US and Mexico have negotiated a “remain in Mexico” deal, which means people looking for safety in the US will be stuck in #Mexico until they find out if they can enter the US. Make no mistake: this could be deadly. Read our response here. https://t.co/O3bF6t4k5G

#SaudiArabia has an appalling human rights track record. Their investigation into the killing of #JamalKhashoggi lacks credibility. A @UN investigation is needed so that those who are responsible are held accountable and face justice.
We welcome reports that #Turkey is calling for an international investigation into #JamalKhashoggi’s murder. #Turkey must request that the UN sets an investigation now.
Saudi prosecutor demands death penalty for 5 suspects in #JamalKhashoggi murder after sham inquiry. We need a credible investigation to establish facts &amp; ensure those responsible are brought to justice in fair trials with no death penalty.
Today’s outcome of the #Saudi investigation on the killing of #JamalKhashoggi is simply not trustworthy. An independent UN investigation is the only option to uncover the truth and achieve justice.

5/5 It is vital that Kateryna Handzyuk’s legacy should not be her work alone, but that her death should mark a line in the sand whereby the #Ukrainian authorities ensure that:		Anyone who harasses, intimidates or assaults civil society activists is brought to justice.
4/5 This answer will only come through an independent, impartial, effective and transparent investigation, the type of which we have not seen in so many cases.
3/5 The death of this fearless civil society activist must spur the Ukrainian authorities into providing a credible answer to the question on everyone’s lips: 		Who killed Kateryna Handzyuk?

A girl stands in the doorway of a village school, next to a chalkboard. The families of many of the children who study at this school, on a small island in the swamp, were forced to flee their home villages. Yet even in the face of  hardship, children seem determined to learn. https://t.co/e2Ks0wliuv
Since December 2013, the conflict in #SouthSudan has claimed thousands of lives and forced nearly four million people to flee. Some have crossed into Uganda, Ethiopia, and other neighboring states, while others are internally displaced within their own country.
A father mourning his dead son, who was killed in a recent attack. According to a UN report, #SouthSudan government troops and allied fighters killed over 200 civilians in Leer and Mayendit counties over a five-week period this year. https://t.co/AaMZLyFvB6
“I woke up to gunfire and ran to the swamp with my children,” one young mother told us. “We hid in the water all day, as soldiers searched for people. We were hungry and scared, and the mosquitoes were biting us. Later we fled to a nearby island.”
This is the Sudd, a vast swamp in #SouthSudan which has served as a refuge for thousands of civilians fleeing recent government attacks. People survived in the swamp on a diet of water lilies &amp; the occasional fish. Many even spent nights in the swamp, resting on rafts. https://t.co/93140cxYoy
The recent government offensive in #SouthSudan has taken a heavy toll on civilians, many of whom have been killed, abducted, or gang raped. The attacks have been characterized by massive looting of civilian property. Hunger has been used as a weapon to force civilians to flee.

Updated numbers from the Palestinian Ministry of Health show 52 people have been killed today in #Gaza, including 5 children under 18.
41 people now killed in #Gaza and almost 2000 injured, over 900 with live ammunition. A shameless violation of international law, in some instances constituting war crimes. The Israeli authorities show no signs they intend to rein in excessive force. #ArmsEmbrago needed.
We are witnessing an abhorrent violation of international law &amp; human rights in #Gaza. 38 confirmed dead, including 6 children, with close to 2000 people injured. Many are reporting injuries to the head and chest. Over 500 injured with live ammunition. This must end immediately.

10/10 "Dear @Erna_Solberg, we call on you to take action. We'd also like to invite you to our school, to explain why "immigration policy considerations" dictate it necessary to send Taibeh and her little brother to Afghanistan just before their exams." #TellNorway #AbbasiStays
9/10 "Many people believe that Norwegian values are being threatened by mass immigration. For us, Norwegian values are about important things like freedom, democracy, inclusion, humanity and respect for human dignity and human rights."
8/10 "We cannot understand that you and your government can stand for such inhumane and unfair treatment of human beings."
7/10 "We have done social studies at school and we understand that immigration policy is difficult. But for us, human considerations must always count the most – quick-fix arguments about woolly political concepts will never justify destroying young people's lives."
6/10 "Since we know you are an avid advocate of women's rights and education, we think it would be strange if you were seen to defend a decision that we perceive to be particularly hostile to women."
5/10 "Taibeh is being sent to Afghanistan, the country her parents fled before she was born. A country she has never been to and has no network in. A country affected by war and terror, where girls in particular are practically without rights."
4/10 "It's hard to imagine the incredible effort invested in adapting to a completely different culture, learning a new language and completing her education in the way that Taibeh has done. Now it seems that this will all go to waste."
3/10 "By all accounts she seemed set to finish with an excellent diploma. Taibeh's goal is to enter university to study medicine, which for her is an absolutely realistic goal."
2/10 "Our fellow student Taibeh has now lived in Norway for 6 years. In three months she was supposed to graduate from Thora Storm High School."
1/10 "Dear Erna. As you probably know, Taibeh Abbasi and her family received the message from the Norwegian Immigration Authority that the family must travel to Afghanistan by 11 March."
#Norway is threatening to imminently deport Taibeh Abbasi and her family to Afghanistan—a place she has never even lived in, and a place that we know is not safe. But these high school students aren't giving up on their friend. This is their open letter to PM @Erna_Solberg: https://t.co/BghktZ0ck0
