@Jdruc00 I think they will win more votes and small dollar donations if they make it clear that they can't be bought by big corporations, etc
@tjhansen Make the case to the American people and rely on smaller donations
@tjhansen That's great. But this bill won't pass the GOP Senate and Trump wont sign. How about Dems unilaterally vow to voluntarily follow a certain anti-corruption code even if it's not the law of the land.
@jDorai Both parties should. You're right. But the Democrats claim to be the party of the people. GOP makes it clear their main goal is lowering taxes for the rich and deregulating corporations.  Democrats should back up their brand with actions that make it clear who they stand with
Democrats should make it their policy to truly drain the swamp. Show that you can't be bought.  Show that you are making policy with no ulterior motives.  Make that a core part of the brand

@tariqnasheed No one asked me to be in a Harvey doc. I'm friends with the #SurvivingRKelly director and several protestors in the #MuteRKelly movement so I had a personal connection and agreed to appear. I don't just go around interviewing for every exposé. This is dumb
@tariqnasheed I'm glad you agree with me that R deserves the Weinstein treatment. Believe the victims, expose the rampant predatory behavior, career destruction and indictment with convictions hopefully in the future.
@DreMicheals1 Weinstein has been exposed. His career is destroyed, he's ostracized from the business  and will never make a movie again.  He's charged with sexual assault and is awaiting trial. If you want the same for R, then great!  Me too.
@BluBell17 We have never collabed. Ever.
@BluBell17 Please show me the songs I made with him. Google really hard. They don't exist.
If y'all wanna cape for R and discount all these women's stories, just say it. Don't bring up some old pics of me and somebody else. https://t.co/2wus2P7vNm
I took a photo with and worked with Harvey on several occasions before his abuse was known to me and the rest of the world.  Since his being exposed, his company and career have rightfully been destroyed and he's been indicted. Sounds like something that should happen to R Kelly https://t.co/LgIOQpEnsP

@danpfeiffer I agree with the writer that all candidates are judged on their likability. But I think he falls to acknowledge that women have much less room to maneuver in that likability matrix. They can't be too tough or too joyous or too anything and it turns out there's nearly nothing left

@chrissyteigen @GQMagazine the people will decide!!
@GQMagazine Unfortunately, it is political, in that it affects our politics and can manifest itself in government decisions.  But I agree with the article that it shouldn't be treated as an equal side in a respectable political debate.
@mattsnavely @eromiclord @mmfa @NateSilver538 I literally said none of that.  I didn't equate speech with terrorism and I didn't propose any government action.  I spoke about consumers' and advertisers' choices in response to speech.
I love you, Seattle!  We had so much fun tonight!  Thank you!!  #ALegendaryChristmas https://t.co/Vq21L3ZZpP
@Nole4life02 @NateSilver538 Yup. We good. Thanks
@NateSilver538 People of good conscience are right to alert the public about it and we can make our purchasing decisions accordingly
@NateSilver538 Far right extremism is the biggest terrorist threat in America. It is, in part, fueled by the rhetoric of demagogues who scare people about brown people and Jews. Some of those demagogues are on prime time on Fox News, getting ad dollars from mainstream corps
@NateSilver538 The logical endpoint of anything moderate could be something extreme. A silly reason to not do that moderate thing.
@NateSilver538 Slippery slope arguments are too easy. Executives can make decisions about what kind of speech goes too far and shouldn't be supported by ad dollars. I would submit that white supremacists should not receive corporate ad dollars

Part of me is talking myself into saying Bruno or the Weeknd but I'm not sure they neatly fit into the genre.
Honestly I don't think there is a king of r&amp;b right now.  Anyone consistently dominating the charts, selling out arenas, etc, a la Usher at his prime. Not a comment on quality.  I think the throne is open right now.
@chrissyteigen Oh no they hacked Chrissy's account!

@secupp He doesn't have a right to be one of 9 on the supreme Court. That is a position of high honor and extreme privilege. He has the right to not be criminally convicted and locked up without convincing evidence. It's a different standard.
@Yi_Dav2016 @secupp Well, you could understand him lying about, say, sexually assualting someone. But lying about getting very drunk is ridiculous and unnecessary.  All these beers and underage drinking and you never went too far?  Obvious bullshit.
@mikedaitch @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp My belief that the government shouldn't have power over a woman's uterus is very much a moral issue. My belief that a supreme Court Justice shouldn't be a liar and sexual assualter: also moral
@TallManShort @US395 @secupp Dr Ford is not absurd and her accusations clearly weren't. Did you watch her testimony?
@liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp These are the sorts of details the FBI investigates to help flesh out the facts and assess the credibility of the accusations.  GOP doesn't want the investigation because they're afraid of the truth.
@liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford came forward before Kavanaugh was even picked, when he was on a short list. That timeline is critical. It shows the party wasn't paying or inciting her to come forward. She knew he had integrity issues and didn't want him to be picked from the shortlist.
@MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp The rape question goes to his credibility, integrity, temperament. It's not a criminal case. There is no beyond a reasonable doubt standard.
@MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp It is not a criminal prosecution of a rape claim. This is not a rape case. It's a job interview to decide whether or not Kavanaugh should get a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. A position that gives him power over all of our lives
@US395 @secupp Trump promised he would pick judges that would overturn RvW. He said women should be punished.  And the federalist society is committed to overturning as well.  So are we supposed to believe that Kavanaugh was picked and won't carry out their plan?
@liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp We dont know the extent of the evidence because the claims haven't been investigated. They should be investigated
@DestructiveChem @secupp Real, actual, sentient human beings have said they were victims of Kavanaugh and his cronies. The Democratic party didn't make this up. If you want to call the women liars, just say it.
@DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford accused him with clarity and credibility. The Democratic party didn't.
@DestructiveChem @secupp Are you calling Dr Ford a liar?  Did she make all of this up?
@JustMaintain @secupp It's about all of it
@secupp And the fact that this person who made all of these "boys will be boys" mistakes as a teenager can now have the power to force a teenage girl to carry a pregnancy to term is downright terrifying.
@secupp I hate his politics. But I'm also resigned to the fact that a conservative without integrity issues will make it to the court, just like Gorsuch did. Kavanaugh is a terrible choice even among conservatives I clearly disagree with
@secupp And I don't think we've ever seen a court nominee display such disdain for the other political party. He obviously can't be even remotely impartial.
@secupp He lied about his involvement in Bush policy decisions and judge nomination campaigns. He most likely lied about the extent of his drinking and other things he could have admitted to. He's not to be trusted.
@secupp The biggest problem with him is that he's lied multiple times before the senate, sometimes about things he needn't lie about.
@JasonBrandon8 So we pick based on who's most qualified now? What does that even mean really
Raise your hand if you believe there's even a tiny chance Kavanaugh has never had so much to drink that he didn't remember some of the night's events.  He's obviously a liar.
People keep saying it's not in the Constitution. That's why we have amendments.  The Constitution can change.  The founding fathers weren't divine.
@raythemaverick I'm saying the Constitution is wrong on this point. I know what it says. I know that it's completely ridiculous in the real world too
@Aftermath8 The founding fathers aren't divine. They fucked up on this one, among other things
And obviously the senate needs to be dramatically changed.  California's representation vs Wyoming is a travesty
I haven't workshopped this but it ain't crazy. It's like best actor and best actress categories.
We should have a man and a woman representing each district and state to guarantee 50/50 representation.
I believe Dr Ford. Thank you for your courage

@BrooklynDecker We were watching it in the labor and delivery room haha. Too funny and too real.
A whole lot of Americans' ancestors brutally enslaved, beat, lynched and raped my ancestors. A lot of the same folks quick to call other folks animals.  What does that make you?  The answer is that we're all human. And some humans do really fucked up things. https://t.co/XBiyHNhUQR
@elliottpatsy1 Some are education related charities, some that deal with criminal justice reform, some that deal with feeding the poor.
@OluwaSirdam When did I support evil?  If we want to prevent evil we need to at least confront the realities that led to it. People don't commit crimes because liberals are too soft to call them animals.
@OluwaSirdam We are the product of a bunch of decisions, including plenty of our own.  But we all have parents, neighborhoods, governments, etc. whose decisions help shape our future too.
@Beard__Chase no, I'm saying some innocent children grow up to be gang members.  do you dispute this obvious fact?
@KentBrockman13 nope.  but they're human. nazis were humans.  kkk members human.  the people who do the absolute worst things are still human.  calling them animals may make us feel better.  doesn't make it true.
Dehumanizing large groups of people is the demagogue's precursor to visiting violence and pain upon them. It makes it easier to destroy their families and much worse.
And we should particularly interrogate the role of American policy in helping to make MS-13 the organization it is now.
But it's much more honest and challenging to realize they were all babies once and think about what in society, their home life, etc took them from baby to violent gang member. And then to think about collective action we could take to mitigate these conditions
Even human beings who commit heinous acts are the same species as us, not "animals". I'm in the hospital with our new son. Any of these babies here could end up committing terrible crimes in the future. It's easy, once they've done so, to distance ourselves from their humanity

The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy.  He made it clear every time he spoke. Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with &gt;1% of anyone's thoughts though
I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth.
They see the statistics about black applications for real estate or loans or employment being turned away because their name was Jamal and not James
They know their family was destroyed by deportation or incarceration. They know their loved one was denied safe harbor because of their religion. They know their son or daughter was shot because their skin color evoked fear
Far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist.
I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences. However...

Data on the effect of the assault weapons ban. The ban is designed to prevent massacres, not gun violence writ large. It’s only a small portion of the solution to our gun violence problem. But it’s an important step toward ending the American epidemic of mass shooting https://t.co/2ced5P2Vrm
@jimmy_molestina Did you hear of the armed stewardesses force?  No.  That would be the proper analogy to teachers being armed.
Arms dealers love arms races.
You’ll note that all NRA-sponsored politicians suggest gun violence solutions that involve more guns being bought and sold. I wonder why that is 🤔
@jennsue8277 A disturbed shooter doesn’t care if the school is private or public. AR-15 bullets don’t discriminate between rich and poor.
The fact this is up for discussion is totally absurd. But this is a good thread to hopefully obliterate the COMPLETELY LUDICROUS idea that arming teachers is the solution to school shootings. https://t.co/yf4jHfpCOR
We don’t pay our teachers enough to TEACH. Now these fools want them to double as armed security.  Meanwhile our kids are the active shooter drill generation.

@secupp Like i said, lax state gun laws correlate with higher gun deaths.  This is not refutable.
@secupp Please see this chart. Most deaths by firearm per capita, all red states with lax gun laws. Illinois not even near the top 10. https://t.co/0onKlCyPOI.
@DannyBritton256 Chicago is not a state.
@secupp Chicago is a stone’s throw from Indiana. DC from Virginia. Surely you know this.
@SethMacFarlane Annnnd deaths by car have gone down significantly since we started better regulation of auto safety. Seems like better regulation might be a remedy for gun deaths too
@secupp @RonaldKlain And our rate of gun massacres like this is beyond incomparable.
@secupp @RonaldKlain Gun deaths are also more prevalent in states with lax gun laws. And America is by far the most gun owning major country and our deaths by gun reflect that, regardless of the decline since the 90s (which corresponds with overall decline in crime)

@CillizzaCNN You too!
@CillizzaCNN I agree that your piece does not make Trump and Weinstein equal.  The one tweet you wrote implied that and I was responding to that tweet
@CillizzaCNN Donors and bundlers are replaceable, and the Democratic Party doesn't need a disgraced movie exec to raise money.
@CillizzaCNN This is true, but in no way mirrors the fact that GOP nominated an admitted sexual abuser to be POTUS.
@CillizzaCNN Furthermore, which prominent liberals are defending Weinstein, nominating him for POTUS, etc.?  Come on.
@CillizzaCNN My point is that putting them on the same plane is ridiculous. If Trump were just a reality show host and exec producer, then it makes sense
@CillizzaCNN Holding a movie exec and the leader of the free world to the same standard is ludicrous.
@CillizzaCNN Sure, we should condemn him.  And neither of them should be President of the United States.

@Sonialand @PureManhattan I agree that we should make health care more affordable for more people in the middle class. Trump does opposite
@Sonialand @PureManhattan the out of state options aren't in this bill. Will supposedly be in "phase 3" assuming this phase is passed
@matslav I know, man.  I really wish people understood how taxes and government are supposed to work.  The concept is so simple, really.
myth = lie in this case. https://t.co/kZkpA9vi26
@Ann53165262 I agree that's not affordable for a lot of Americans. The answer is to make it more so. Trumpcare does the opposite.

@PureManhattan these are not opinions. Bill phases out Medicaid extension and cuts taxes for rich people whose taxes were raised for ACA
If only there was an organization that pooled all our tax money and redistributed it to help cover those in need. Someone should invent this https://t.co/U0zwRuIeTu
Trumpcare gives billions in taxes back to people like me. Takes healthcare from millions of ordinary Americans. This is terrible.
That's what taxes are for. Trump/Ryan plan lowers my taxes so they can take health care from poor/working class. https://t.co/tJQ15uDjIb

@Trauberstar again, they don't necessarily hate young people, but they're more likely to win if college students don't vote
@Trauberstar they also try to limit student voting whenever they can. Also, because they vote Dem.
@Trauberstar it's not because they necessarily hate minorities. It's because they know they vote Dem and want less Dem votes.
@Trauberstar minorities are more likely to not have the required ID. GOP lawmakers know this and use it to lower Dem turnout
@Trauberstar that is immoral. I'm taking your word for it because I don't know about that example
@Trauberstar of course there are felons of all colors. But lawmakers knew it would hurt POC more and that was a reason for doing it.
@Trauberstar yes and has always been aimed at black voters. When they were originally written, the legislators said that.
@Trauberstar both are self-serving but one is most definitely less righteous.
@Trauberstar dems want to maximize the the legal vote. GOP, the opposite. Not morally equivalent, in my opinion.
@Trauberstar @POTUS he's either delusional or intentionally lying. And he undermines credibility in our democracy
@Trauberstar @POTUS it's not like it's even plausible. He just needs to say and/or believe it to feel legitimate and demonize "illegals"
@Trauberstar formerly incarcerated deserve the right to vote after they've paid their debt to society. They have to pay taxes. Shld vote too
@OCSBRom are you aware of the history of America?  pretty much everything in America was anti-black until recently
@Trauberstar again, he does it for personal gain (possibly millions of $). What gain from voting illegally?
@Trauberstar millions of illegal voters is an outright lie. Myth is probably to gentle of a term
@Trauberstar for it to swing an election, it would have to be organized by large groups of voters.
@Trauberstar but what would you gain from taking the risk of getting caught. 1 vote?  I guess you could do it for fun and to tell the story
@Trauberstar ID laws sounds so innocent, but those laws are targeted toward poor POC likely to vote for Dems. The lawmakers are well aware
@Trauberstar and the Brennan center article gives the numbers for % chance of voter impersonation. Extremely low. Minuscule. Near 0
@Trauberstar please google the NC case. It's exemplary of other cases nationwide
@Trauberstar it is literally a lie intended to target potential democratic voters, particularly black and brown ones. It is pretty clear
@Trauberstar it is indeed. Courts in NC actually said the legislature made a "surgical" effort to identify ways to suppress black votes.
@Trauberstar we all know why it's even discussed. Only to justify suppression and, in DJT's case, to make him feel better about pop vote
@Trauberstar if by nuance you mean 0.000007 % or something, yes I agree
@tomrogers1995 Read it again.
@Trauberstar criminals usually think they'll gain something from their crime. What's the incentive to vote 2x?  Or vote once illegally?
@ginaderosa exactly. Just another excuse for Trump to demonize brown people

I believe Trump to be a lying narcissist bigot who is completely unfit to be president. For our country's sake, I'd love to be wrong.

@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine some of reduced labor participation is aging baby boomers. Some is people who gave up
@Dindoo_Nuffin @lisa_germaine they're the same people that calculate labor participation which isn't as favorable to obama.

Improvement should mean more coverage for more people at a more affordable price. I'm afraid GOP will go in opposite direction.
Obamacare was the free market conservative compromise modeled after Romneycare. It was bound to be imperfect. But millions were helped by it
To be clear, I wish US had truly universal health coverage, something to the left of Obamacare. But going backwards will literally kill ppl
@IanMcGimsey so let's improve it to make it even more affordable!
That's literally what I'm doing when I pay taxes. This is how redistribution works. I'm happy to do it for a good cause like health care https://t.co/ggfYZmlQqD
"Hollywood celebrities need to shut up!"  Oh ok. Who did you vote for?  "the reality show star. And Reagan was the greatest president ever!"
*ignoramus https://t.co/lopsDaDmz4
Tony, you're sounding downright deplorable. Why so angry? https://t.co/ebFK6PCMcK
@kortgable let's hope the GOP replacement makes it more affordable. I'm afraid it will go in the opposite direction.
Oh, silly Mike. Come see me when you have something substantive to say https://t.co/XMbnJa5nQ4
@sasmanic then the fixes to Obamacare should improve it to make it even more affordable. I'm afraid they will go in the opposite direction
@kortgable I encourage you to investigate the available plans. Most aren't nearly that expensive. And subsidies make it much cheaper
@CarltonFoster4 people don't buy Obamacare. It's just a regulated exchange for private insurance plans. I have insurance through my union.
@missmagen23 it's all messy. Obamacare is actually the "happy" medium. We either go to less coverage/more instability or universal coverage
@willjackrob subsidies/Medicaid cover those in poverty and middle class above poverty line (unless red state won't accept it)
@missmagen23 reinstating the pre-existing conditions restrictions and lifetime benefit limits would truly bankrupt you if you get sick
@natelaplume73 I'd prefer true universal care/single payer.  So I'd be happy for us to go left of Obamacare.
@Oli_W49 @chancetherapper we can do more than hope. Speak up when the replacement they offer is inadequate. More than likely it will be
Call me a Hollywood elitist, but I think it's unconscionable that the richest country in the world would go back to bankrupting the sick
@Oli_W49 I hope the GOP replacement is an improvement for you and the country. I sincerely doubt it though.
@AntiWestboro I wish you the best under the new regime. I hope the GOP will find a way to make sure you have more affordable care
@HAMbonian @LOLGOP trust me, if I'm being selfish, I don't need any government help and repeal would lower my taxes. This isn't for me
@Link0292 that would be too easy and sensible. America has to make the most convoluted work-around, of course
I sincerely hope working class Trump voters speak out about what it will mean for them to lose their coverage. Call your congressperson
Governing is not a game. It's all fun when you can pass 70 repeal bills that get vetoed. Now actual lives are at stake.
Obamacare replacement plan is currently delay, delay, delay and try to blame it on someone else when it all collapses https://t.co/e7cUqcp7gt

@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze how can both be true?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze you're certain that millions voted illegally. Also certain that there's no tangible proof
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze millions is a lot of people. Surely there is some proof that led you to this number
@Awake_Today @theblaze that hoax is terrible. But the truth of hate crimes spike is verified and very real.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze if you can't believe any govt stat, what's the point in discussing it?  Goodnight
@Awake_Today @theblaze examples?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze why wouldn't we be brilliant enough to cheat in the swing states?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze how do you know that it's millions if there's no paper trail?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze so you can just make unproven claims as though they are facts?  Why the certainty?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze thank god trump is here to save us!
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze look at all the data on GDP, unemployment, stock market, incomes. All improved since 2008
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze there are people suffering. Far fewer than 2008/09. Thank you to Obama
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze if Dems were so brilliant at cheating, why would we have wasted it on CA and not MI/PA/WI
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze ok. I need you to show me proof of these millions of illegal voters. I'll wait
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze do you not recall how bad things were in 2008?  so much better now.  Indisputable
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze incomes have gone up, GDP growth at 3+% recently. Where is this devastation he caused?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze the unemployment rate is calculated the same way under every president.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze haha. This is hilarious. Yet sad. What you're saying is just ridiculous and unproven
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze you have no proof. It's completely false and defies common sense
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze proof please.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze the devastation happened in 2008. Obama rescued us from it. The facts are clear
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze unemployment in 2009 over 10%. Now under 5%. Stock market grew. Auto industry saved
@Awake_Today @theblaze the rise in hate crimes is a fact. The false, hate-inciting statements he made are on the record. This isn't opinion
@Awake_Today @theblaze but when someone in leadership (the future POTUS) is spreading dangerous lies, it fuels hate and violence
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze especially in places like California where the outcome is already guaranteed to be blue
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze it's already an inconvenience to vote. Why would you wait in line and risk arrest?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze think about how stupid it would be for a person to vote illegally
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze they don't count. There is no proof that millions of illegal voters voted.
@Awake_Today @theblaze if you think thousands of muslims, were dancing on a rooftop on 9/11, I don't know what to tell you
@Awake_Today @theblaze if you're still holding on to the birther lie, there's no hope for you. Let it go, my friend. Let it go
@Awake_Today @theblaze are they though?  They've been subjected to a rise in hate crimes and suspicion because of his false statements
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze I'm not arguing whether or not he is the legal PEOTUS. I'm saying she won working class
@Awake_Today @theblaze Joe arpaio is a clown. Luckily the people of Arizona voted him out.
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze minorities' votes still count. I'm sorry for the inconvenience
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze Hillary won the working class. If you exclude minorities, Trump won the working class
@Awake_Today @theblaze does it get tiring defending him?  You know what I'm saying is factual, right?
@Awake_Today @theblaze I respect that you're so committed to defending him that you'll keep going back and forth with me.
@Awake_Today @theblaze he literally said it would be a temporary ban on all muslims. How is that not a ban?
@Awake_Today @theblaze he's a lying, bigoted clown. Keep defending him though.
@Awake_Today @theblaze and claimed credit for forcing him to show his birth cert and never apologized for the whole ridiculous charade
@Awake_Today @theblaze refugees are always extensively vetted in America, by the way.
@Awake_Today @theblaze it's unconstitutional to ban entire religious group from America. Think if he said the same about Jews or Catholics
@Awake_Today @theblaze *birther
@Awake_Today @theblaze he disavowed Duke. He has never apologized for his own bigoted pronouncements. Not even the obvious birthed lie
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze she won among all people for that matter. But who cares about the popular vote, right?
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze the fact is she won among people making 50k or less.  Check the data.
@Awake_Today @theblaze that's fine. Trump is the one proposing a Muslim ban. That's the definition of painting everyone with a broad brush
@Bilbo_2501 @carrieksada @irritatedwoman @theblaze Hillary won the majority of those making under 50k. She won the working class.
@Awake_Today @theblaze he has never apologized for his own bigoted statements, the reasons why Duke supports him in the first place
@Awake_Today @theblaze it's literally made life more dangerous for my Muslim friends when lies like this are spread
@Awake_Today @theblaze he did it to question the loyalty of muslims. This subjects them to more suspicion and hate crimes
@Awake_Today @theblaze it is completely false. It was a bullshit rumor that a candidate for president shouldn't be saying.
@Awake_Today @theblaze he never renounced or apologized for his own bigoted statements. He had to be pressed to denounce Duke too.
@Awake_Today @theblaze if you support him despite these things, just say that. Don't deny they happened when they're on the record
@Awake_Today @theblaze has he apologized for his false statements about Mexican immigrants being esp prone to rape and murder? Of course not
@Awake_Today @theblaze are you saying that trump has renounced any of his racist/bigoted statements?  You know that's not true
@Awake_Today @theblaze he has neither renounced nor apologized for anything. He said a lot of this stuff in the last 12 months.
@Awake_Today @theblaze why did he lie about thousands of muslims celebrating 9/11 in jersey?  Why the Muslim ban? He's a lying bigot
@Awake_Today @theblaze trump is loved and celebrated by current, proud white nationalists, kkk and neo nazis
@Awake_Today @theblaze Byrd sought redemption and profusely apologized for and renounced his kkk past
@Awake_Today @theblaze Is it worse to befriend a guy who renounced the kkk or be supported and celebrated by current kkk/neo-nazis?
@Awake_Today @theblaze that statement is literally the opposite of true.
@Awake_Today @theblaze please re-read the meme you sent to me. It shows him with black people and said he was never accused of racism
@Awake_Today @theblaze sad that these memes circulate and they're the opposite of true. I hope you learn the truth
@Awake_Today @theblaze he was literally sued for racism in the 70's and settled.  He avoided renting to blacks and marked their applications
@Awake_Today @CarolynG1014 @theblaze check the job creation records of Dems vs GOP presidents. Numbers don't lie.
@Awake_Today @CarolynG1014 @theblaze cool story. Trickle down economics. GOP has done a good job selling that one
@Awake_Today @theblaze I'm done arguing with you because you've chosen what you want to believe. I hope he does a good job for the country
@Awake_Today @theblaze haha. This is a joke. She did say superpredators once though.
@Awake_Today @theblaze yes, he picked mike pence as his running mate, the poster boy for LGBTQ tolerance.
@Awake_Today @CarolynG1014 @theblaze the VAST majority of tax savings under trump will go to rich people. We don't need it
@Awake_Today @theblaze he does say bigoted things. That's not an opinion. It's a fact. If you agree with him, fine.
@CarolynG1014 @Awake_Today @theblaze trump is going to cut our taxes. "Elites" voting selfishly had plenty of reason to vote for him.
@GotKidsNoPeace sadly, I've listened to far too many of his incoherent ramblings.
@Awake_Today @theblaze I think you're very confused about me. I'm from a blue collar family in Ohio. No producer tells me what to say.
@jwaters142 @carrieksada this is the literal definition of islamophobia. Your fear of sharia law and muslims is irrational
@jwaters142 @carrieksada so you're imagining some transformation of america so radical that rape will become legal because of muslims???
@theblaze odd tweet when I never actually said that. Why don't you just quote what I said?

@LuLuWhoLu @Politichick71 California and New York help support a lot of red states with our tax money. You're welcome.
@RowlandViki @kanyewest @realDonaldTrump @CNNPolitics Kanye's music is awesome. I agree on that!
@Politichick71 we're so used to this blue-red paradigm that we talk about votes in terms of states when we should talk in terms of people
@Politichick71 no, the voters would decide. Wherever they are, they would count equally. Their state of residence would be irrelevant.
@Politichick71 one person, one vote would be the fairest, most representative system. Clearly
@Politichick71 but they get credit for their 2 senators also. The same as big states. So it proportionally adds more weight to small states
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard by my logic, a farmer in Iowa would literally have the exact same vote as an elitist liberal singer in LA :)
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard and swing state voters get more impact than solid red or blue state voters, which is also unfair
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard the only way all votes count equally is to use the popular vote. Elec college weighs small state voters more
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard yes he won a lot more counties. This is the correct # though. And she won millions more votes (actual people)
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard https://t.co/oMuT7Ms7du
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard odd that you think people's votes should count more in sparsely populated areas. Why?
@Politichick71 @PhinsDiehard the counties argument is irrelevant anyway. But these are not the facts. I'm sorry.
@lgothard agreed on the nobody's perfect comment!  God bless America!
@SeanSea120 @PhinsDiehard My father worked in a factory everyday for 30 years and never made over $50K/yr.  He is a working man.
@SeanSea120 @PhinsDiehard There are a lot of people working very hard to make 25, 35, 45k/yr.  It's said you're so disdainful of them.
@PhinsDiehard I am fully aware of the electoral college and the rules of the election.  He will be president.  Enjoy.
@PhinsDiehard this is a completely false statement.  It's sad that so many false facts are floating around.  Believe what you like though.
@Annalou321 ummm, Hillary won lower-income voters (under $50K) and got the most votes overall.  These are facts.
