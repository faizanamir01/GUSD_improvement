Hi twitterers can I have a personal and business twitter account?
No matter how we all feel about @BernieSanders we can not talk about age, one thing Bernie does have is stamina. He rally’s his base. And he raised over 1mil in a few hours, so there is that! Not my choice but if he wins we all need to stand behind him.

@TheDemocrats make a real feasible plan, show it, market it and get out there and talk directly to the people. The End!
Do you fucken jobs already. Show @realDonaldTrump supporters just how this wall will affect them in their lives. And how they will be losing their support systems. Show them how we can secure our boarders with out taking away their safety net.
We have geography issues where it’s not even possible, we have a northern boarder that will have no wall. Show them why and how a wall is not the answer and then show them your plan. Get out there with a real plan not just talking points.
We don’t want to dismantle @ICEgov you need to be on every network with a white board showing them in pictures how building a wall along the boarder is not feasible, we have private citizen that own some of the land (imminent domain, takes years)
@SpeakerPelosi and the @TheDemocrats are not very good at messaging, they need to make it as simple and basic let @realDonaldTrump supporters  know we the Dems do want boarder security.  And we don’t want them to lose out in the process.
