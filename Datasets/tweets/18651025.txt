Agree. And it wasn’t just that trio - up and down the ballot in ruby red states progressive dems ran as their authentic selves and over performed. We may not have won in MS but we shattered fundraising goals and turn out. https://t.co/f9WfA7UV44

In many cases - including some this year - those same candidates failed to even raise the $$ to really compete. Donors are sneaky like that — they can smell bs. And the same old tired formula has failed to generate excitement from our small dollar activists.
I’m tired of this narrative. Dems in the South have tried that formula - apppeal to AA voters &amp; liberals in private/primary but in public/general abandon those principles &amp; become a milquetoast generic candidate indistinguishable from GOP &amp; we’ve lost nearly every time.
*but also set records in turn out &amp; $$ w/ progressive candidates.	And we saw the standard formula - Dem turned GOP lite who won’t address issues that poll under 80% lose with larger margins. The lesson may be run authentic rather than twisting into something voters see through. https://t.co/l3nDCdC0Kc

Not sure where your state falls? Hint: take a look at your legislature, take a look at your governor. And if you still have questions @ReproRights is your go to resource #ScotusPick
21 states currently have “pre-viability” bans in place.  41 states have zero constitutional or statutory protections in place of Roe falls. Overall nearly half the country is at the greatest risk of outright ban should this landmark case be overturned. #ScotusPick
10 states still have their pre-Roe laws making abortion illegal on the books - and it’s not just the usual suspects. Think places like Massachusetts and Michigan. #ScotusPick
If Roe falls 4 states have in place what we call “trigger laws”. Meaning these states have passed an abortion ban that springs into effect the instant or soon after Roe is overturned &amp; would not require any legal action to go into effect. #ScotusPick		https://t.co/ganDilZfCF

@lesbraswell @JamesSmithSC That actually wasn’t the bill - but when trying to find the consumer advocate bill in 2004 your candidate referenced last time and finding no such bill was introduced I’m not confident y’all know how to use the legislative bill tracker.
@Jimmyspolitics @WillisGov Lol. Sure. Having drinks with someone of the opposite side is something to attack. And you wanna talk ethics - you should look at your own running mate - to quote the folks pushing ethics reform in this state “John Scott and ethics don’t even belong in the same sentence”

East Coast friends, if you have an animal, bring it inside, if you see an animal left out call your local rescue or authorities. We’ve seen too many reports of animals left outside freezing to death &amp; this is going to be brutal for our furry friends, esp ones without homes.
