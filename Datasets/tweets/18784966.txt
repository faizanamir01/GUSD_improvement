@94Iovebot @brandonkhristph More eco friendly packaging would be ideal too, but the original post shows them using a ziplock bag, and realistically that’s what most people are going to be doing.	In the end the intentions are great but the net value doesn’t seem to be. :/
@94Iovebot @brandonkhristph That would be ideal if it didn’t produce more packaging and transportation waste. I keep mine around the house and use them for things—sending a few out in small baggies repeatedly is not sustainable. “Why not help” — why not let people donate $ so they can order bulk batches.
@94Iovebot @brandonkhristph It would make more sense to donate money so they can order them bulk/direct from a supplier.   Small packages add up and is less sustainable w.r.t. transportation and packaging waste.

@_754 @datngu @Kotaku Sigh don’t bother with this dude lol. Pretty sure if he’s as clever as he tries to appear, he would’ve known which keywords to type into Researchgate to begin with instead of feigning genuine curiosity in order to pick fights with strangers.
@_754 @datngu @Kotaku ELI5 lol
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku Objective facts can shape broad experience and perception of it, especially in this case. To rule out restaurants for a guy who's eaten like half of Hong Kong, in a convo about cultural perception, is a pretty big assumption. But hey, what do I know.
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku If you're really asking, there's a handful of researchers and doctoral students at just about every university publishing dissertations about modern racism/micro-aggressions every year. Easy to google but depressing to read.
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku With all due respect I thought the takeaway tonight was to not make assumptions about other people's experiences. But I guess even a purist like you is capable of that, ha.
@datngu @_754 @Kotaku Where did he say he was comparing home-cooked food to restaurant food?
@harrylinyiran @Kotaku Oh lol
@harrylinyiran @Kotaku There's nothing wrong with westerners learning Japanese and my comment isn't about that.
@fallowtreveller @mixielot Yeah I saw that on her page later. Feeling bad that no one seemed to pick up on it.
@datngu I was referring to asking about and hearing their experiences, not just my interactions with them. What then would be your suggestion for how to make the most of another's perspective?
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku You forgot to hint in your satire that we still consider Americans' opinions to be relevant lol.
@datngu Pretty sure I said "close friends and family members who grew up into adults in East Asia", which is their experience, not mine.		Honestly I can't tell if you're just bored and trolling, or trying to have an actual conversation.
@Einchy @Kotaku Put it another way, it's great that people in Asia see this type of stuff and have the confidence to not care, and I wish the same was for Asians in the west. (I can't speak for everyone) but when we grow up hearing Asian languages/culture mocked all the time, it changes things.
@Einchy @Kotaku I believe you. I've seen vids of her speaking Japanese years ago and found it pretty impressive and adorable. But the whole kanji/hanzi tattoo thing falls into a certain umbrella that we've had to see repeatedly. I suppose some of us associate it with being stereotyped further.
@Einchy @Kotaku Oh, it isn't. I said Asians because I remember very similar things happening in the past that resulted in near-identical articles like "look at these examples of netizens in China not caring, therefore no one should". This is just another example of that, hence my "good ol'"
@Einchy @Kotaku Why does it have nothing to do with us? Plenty of Asian immigrants speak and read Asian languages.		Edit: hold on, I'm actually confused now. 	Kanji has "nothing to do with Asian people in the West", yet I don't hear you saying it has nothing to do with an Italian American. :|
@datngu @Kotaku Because I have close friends and family members who grew up into adults in East Asia and perceive racist comments completely differently (i.e. don't bat an eye at them). We've also had long conversations about it. No assumptions were ever made.
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku Oh god. I'd actually thought this tweet was a direct reply to me and it wasn't. Sorry for being catty at a total stranger.
@rip_miguerino @Kotaku They certainly do overreact a lot in general. But my original comment is about Asian immigrants being rightfully offended. That's more specific than just American.
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku I'm not American and I'm originally from Shanghai. Nice try at a "gotcha" though.
@datngu @Kotaku *effects aghhh
@datngu @Kotaku It's briefly mentioned in the article. When people have never experienced being a minority and didn't grow up with the negative affects of appropriation, they'll of course think people like me are being dramatic. But their reactions are then used to downplay our experiences.
@liliiilllliiili @Kotaku Yeah, they do think that, because they're being ignorant about something they think is too complicated.

@jonaweinhofen The best parts of hot pot are arguably the sauce (which is vegan), and the napa cabbage, tofu, and bamboo shoots. 		fyi Chinese diets probably comprise of the most vegetables out of *tradition*, economic necessity, and because we actually know how to make them taste good.

@IveBeenTreaded True. In terms of even very mainstream games, Splatoon and any Mario game have 0 diversity, but only OW—one game—receives criticism rather than the medium/industry as a whole. I’ve seen similar things happen for movie castings and it’s def not a helpful way to start a debate.
@IveBeenTreaded @6arks Do you mean that in relation to the average multiplayer game? or all games, or something else? The amount of metrics that indicate bias to someone vary from person to person. To you there's no bias, but to OP there is. I myself wouldn't be too quick to be absolute about it.
@HellmannsCanada Why tweet this out to consumers and guilt us when farmers, manufacturers and suppliers are responsible for most food waste, which is out of our control anyway?
@IveBeenTreaded @6arks Already more complicated than it needs to be here.

@Elbii01 @10tacool @seuIgioh @OliviaisMyGod Wendy was western-educated (didn't she go to high school in Richmond Hill in the GTA?) and would've learned about minority issues, so the expectations for her to be cultural sensitive are different, I assume.

@Valthehbic @QueenGeekChique @parentsmagazine @IMKristenBell That’s a valid point I hadn’t thought of, but I think it also varies to different degrees depending on the personality of the child. Similar to how some adults idolize or even mimic traits of their favourite sitcom/movie character and others never do.
@funder From everything far-right conservatives have been saying, they should be denouncing what happened to this man. They:	- hate Islam	- claim to hate any hint of totalitarian governing	- claim to embrace free speech more than any people I’ve seen		So why aren’t they? So confusing.

@WithAG85 @TeenVogue You haven’t met me and are assuming I undereat, when I eat the same amount as my bf who is 70lb more than me. But *I’m* the one projecting, haha, okay. You sound abusive.
@WithAG85 @TeenVogue Lol, you hear that, Vogue. Accusing a naturally underweight person of having ED. This is the type of person defending your article.		You sound like my 7th grade teacher who should’ve been fired for doing the same thing. Shame on you. :/
@WithAG85 @TeenVogue The main cues of an “emaciated” person is a gaunt face (usually makeup), but also small shoulders and lack of chest muscles (above and underneath the boobs). When those body features are small they’re almost impossible to build and hard to distinguish b/w intentional and natural.
@WithAG85 @TeenVogue In relation to clothes that goes directly onto “emaciated” bodies, is it not implying they’re one and the same?	Given how comfortably you use the word emaciated (which you’d no doubt think I was), would you yourself take issue if they did explicitly call their bodies childlike 🤔
@WithAG85 @TeenVogue A “decent eye” often does not. If it were, I wouldn’t have been constantly accused growing up that I was anorexic. Still happens now actually, and I’m not even size 0. 		And for the ones who do have disorders, is insulting their bodies helpful at all? Is that how to treat people?
@majaruns @TeenVogue I think most *thin people in general* are naturally underweight. Read it again. And if you’re actually arguing against someone who has a problem with calling ANY body “childlike” whether or not they have a disorder or not, you’re naive and insensitive.
wtf is wrong with people who find Bradley Cooper sexy
@0therL1fe @TheEconomist Using “buy” in that context is one of the many ways American media aims to strip Chinese ppl of their cultural value and cheapen us. Just another red scare tactic that’s getting old *yawn*
@davestopera I asked a classmate to burn a cd for me that had Seven Nation Army 10 times in a row on it as the only song, and they actually did it for me. I apparently didn’t know the loop button existed on my cd player.

@verge Within tech, I don’t see how social media has “more invisibility” as the article states, especially compared to web dev, where people’s work often gets lost in the mix.		At least with social media one person usually presides over everything and can definitively claim credit.

@juliavondebur @angryasianman God I wish the rest of Twitter would be as nuanced as this tweet.
@juliavondebur @angryasianman Yes I agree. I think some people want to talk about visibility under the umbrella of representation and end up denying one or more parts of an actor's heritage, which isn't very helpful.
@juliavondebur @madelinemoy @angryasianman He's still Asian, but he doesn't get treated the same as Asians who are hyper-visible (not that I expect him to or would wish that on anyone).

@DevonHill95 @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 Good point, and made me realize my original tweet sounded ambiguous. By "make better", help, etc., I meant more like getting people like her to change their mindsets and be less hateful. Shaming her will make her jobless/homeless/retreat to the dark web, but not less dangerous.
@KatieDid927 @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 For the record, some of the people I see who rant like that ARE neo nazis, but something about this woman suggested otherwise to me. She just seemed to unravel near the end.
@VoxPop2018 @hippiecoll @Silver_Jesus_ @RealMarcN @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 Hmmm, ok that’s fair.
@KatieDid927 @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 I’ve seen lots of homeless people in Toronto ranting about it in the Sherbourne area. And mental illness comes in different forms. Never did I imply they are all or mostly like this woman is.
@KatieDid927 @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 I dunno, I guess it’s because I live in a neighbourhood where a lot of unstable drug addicts walk around screaming that stuff &amp; more, all the time. They’re not mentally there and might as well be saying that the sky falls up.

@GraceJansen2 @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 Yeah and I’m Asian and I’m sure lots of neo nazis want me dead too, but this is more than just bigotry. You can tell by her laugh 2/3 of the way in that her thoughts are completely nonsensical and detached.
@RealMarcN @BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 That’s the word I was looking for, yes!
@BigGrinFilms Not only is it obvious this woman is mentally ill, but the guy behind the camera seems to be getting a kick out of it and possibly filming to embarrass her for her mental state rather than to condemn her message or defend minorities.
@BigGrinFilms @WholePlateWay @abramson1234 So this thread is actually a pool to collect therapy funds for her? Because shaming her isn't going to make this better. If you listen to the video she isn't on any team and wants *everything* annihilated. Not really Trumpism in my book.

2. it's a movie that involves crazy rich Asians, but it is not about them. It's about people like Rachel.	3. actual 'crazy rich Asians' didn't live as immigrants and are not the ones fighting for this type of representation. The movie's movement, quite simply, wasn't for them.
So I know a lot of Asians find Crazy Rich Asians to be classist, but here's the thing:	1. there's a diff between representing wealthy/elite POC vs acknowledging in the west that they exist. Here, it functions more as a debunker than a glamorizer, given how we've been stereotyped.

@nerdyasians And it sounds like they want to imitate a wuxia movie since those are becoming more popular with westerners now. If people really want something exactly like Disney’s animated Mulan, they can just rewatch it.

@chrissyteigen If Japanese restos in US/Canada were authentic and reflected what Japanese people actually cook and eat nowadays, they would actually serve more food like this. You should watch Cooking With Dog–they make a great carbonara.
@MarissDiBernard @chrissyteigen They’re Japanese-style western foods—adopted into Japanese cuisine and reshaped, so they are Japanese foods. Kinda like American pepperoni pizza.

@thesydneygreene I’ve seen a lot of similar tweets today that sound like companies that do this aren’t aware they’re being classist. Nope, they’re totally aware. Especially in fashion, fine arts, design, and bougie writing, they prefer to filter for those they assume to be ‘born with good taste’.

@_754 Hair and beard styles don’t count because you don’t have to drastically and unreasonably change your diet to keep up. Not sure if different athletic shapes become unfashionable for men—there are simply different types that are always “in”.
@JohnFugelsang I mean yeah, they are better at mass production than any other country. If only they were paid fare wages for it and let’s hope they find new jobs soon that treat them better. Is that what you mean?
@Daily_Star So many questions. Like... are they even going to bother restoring it? Is someone gonna check if that Makenna girl fainted?
So strange how areas of women’s bodies go in and *out* of style. Hip bones, big boobs, petite boobs, thigh gap, thick thighs, clavicles, chest bones.		Haven’t seen an equivalent for men that’s as detailed—the standards for them have always simply been “look fit and maybe buff”.

I try not to geotag posts anymore.
@EricSchu_Ras @fmanjoo That’s exactly why I mentioned Insta in particular. Facebook owns the data but hypothetically if I only ever used Insta, FB would’ve had way less of my data anyway—my name, some snapshots, a list of my closest friends. cc @LGrisaru
@fmanjoo I don’t have well formed ideas either, but afaik:	Instagram has far less of my (or typical users’) data than Facebook does, since it’s only a microsite, hasn’t been around for nearly as long, and became popular after people became more aware about oversharing/privacy.

@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL Plus AI is still bad at detecting the *meaning* of human expressions and emotions, esp. based on context, esp. when the whole thing centers around humans acting unpredictably.

@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL Er, yeah I realize that? But that's not in the current iteration of self-driving cars.	And I'm saying it IS the cars'/designers'/engineers'/regulators' fault for rolling these cars out BEFORE that feature is fully reliable.
@Shes_deathProof @ajplus @MiQL That wouldn’t properly deal with real life situations, like pedestrians making last-minute decisions, or communicating w/ the driver via casual eye contact and hand gestures.

@dopemamapdx @nytimes Yeah. Because other than that, I'm actually really curious how they planned to make a quiet chip, and how quiet. Because of a distasteful podcast plug, we'll never get to taste it now.
@dopemamapdx @nytimes I think for men too. E.g. those HUNGRY MAN tv dinner trays have always grinded my gears, including the commercials. Like wow, 1 pound of food, surely that would overwhelm any woman.
@dopemamapdx @nytimes Never thought of it that way! When neutral products get split into genders, it looks like a desperation to find  undesirable and nonexistent differences.		Especially because Doritos are gender neutral, doesn't creating a female version assign default Doritos as male. Lol...🤭
@Ceo_Branding @dopemamapdx @nytimes They should also compute chances of causing offensiveness and possible boycotts/brand switching. Even if you disagree with the backlash, think it's totally uncalled for, etc., the fact is that it exists, and they're buyers.

@Ceo_Branding @nytimes And if you give my comment about sakura chips a second read, I *do* think preferences based on gender are a real thing. Hence why I think they would sell well.
@Ceo_Branding @dopemamapdx @nytimes Never said it was evil. I just think it becomes *less effective*.		Also, you could communicate without sounding so angry. This should be an interesting discussion with some disagreements being par for the course.
@ColoredWaif @angryasianman It works pretty well with their characters. By the time I was 11 my Mandarin was really broken too.
@dopemamapdx @nytimes Yeah, it can be such a subtle art.		I might get flack for saying this, but if Doritos released like, sakura chips in a pink bag for spring in Japan, people would be ordering them online/not offended, even though the company’s intent would be rooted in traditional gender roles.
@dopemamapdx @nytimes True. In the most cynical sense, it's like a magician revealing their secrets. And in marketing it makes the audience feel like they're predictable, and no one likes that.

@quasives Agree. There's definitely something personal behind it. And I mean, we all have issues, but when someone takes it out on others by hurting them in broad strokes, it's just wrong.
@quasives It's funny because assimilated immigrants are already considered "white/whitewashed" and there are plenty of white people who are tolerant and nice. I get that she wants to be included/accepted, but there are so many other ways than the alt-right.
@quasives That is so unfortunate. I've also seen her facetiously coax girls who don't wear a hijab to "go put on your hijab". It's like "I have no basis for hating you, so can you give me a reason to, because you're middle eastern." Really interesting i.e. inconsistent.
@quasives Oh wait I think I misread your tweet. Maybe? I'm so sleepy and confused rn =_=
@quasives Huh?? I'm not defending her. I'm saying it's hypocritical of her to blame other immigrants for things when she does the same thing.
@quasives I read in an article months ago that she "redpilled her whole family" and that's like, you do you I guess... but this makes it so look so bad.		Also, I can only imagine how harsh she'd be about people's parents who don't speak English if they were from a Muslim-majority country.

@FryRsquared 56%-75% of a hazelnut kernel is oil.		1 serving of nutella has 21g of sugar, compared to 1 serving of grapes which has 20g of sugar.		Do some folks just have a phobia of things broken up into its constituents?
@jeremijello14 @Hanyo255 I guess you don't know how Twitter works, because they were telling me to ignore the attention seeker. You were just tagged. :)		And honestly? This wonderful inspiring thread never needed your hate and misinformation, so you should just delete your garbage and get lost.
@jeremijello14 @Hanyo255 Well first of all, they were talking to ME there, not you.		And we are defending our people and culture, not attention seeking. What are *you* doing in a thread about Chinese people spreading lies about us and then being sarcastic at us?
@Hanyo255 You're right. People like this who choose to be ignorant are just so unbelievable though aaghhh. https://t.co/J4la8R4OSp
@jeremijello14 @Hanyo255 Uh, yes. But keep believing they just want to look like you. It's no surprise we can't even be ourselves without an entitled westerner making it about themselves. Jan.
@jeremijello14 @Hanyo255 It's classist, not racist.		And you're being racist and ignorant for assuming that many East Asians aren't just born with pale skin. They're not just represented in the west.
@ikari I guess always assume no woman is annoyed unless they literally use the word mansplain, or they're your girlfriend/wife. 😅

@ikari @Ethelmonster @Nanohabro It's just from my experience and hearing other women's, that if she politely speaks up, it's perceived as offended, and if she doesn't speak up in order to avoid being seen as offended, it comes off as cold (which is perceived as offended).
@ikari @Ethelmonster @Nanohabro Maybe female colleagues have also just said "oh, I know this part/already knew most of this" and you're just assuming they're offended?		Considering male and female reactions are perceived differently (by men and women), it wouldn't surprise me.

@_ellenbrook Lol sorry too. 😅
@_ellenbrook It sounded rhetorical is all (especially within the context of Twitter). *Sounded*. I genuinely just thought you might’ve known more than some other people here and had a source that I wasn’t seeing online.
@_ellenbrook The firefighter’s argument is a false equiv, but he didn’t claim same code of conduct. However the language of your tweets seemed to postulate the opposite, and without any evidence. Maybe I just totally misread.
@moniqueblognet I can’t imagine G-Dragon (and countless other kpop acts which heavily borrow from hip hop) being banned in China. Maybe when it gets appropriated and repackaged enough, it gets a pass.
@_ellenbrook @BogeyandBaccall @Baileyco303 @Mantaaaray @CBCAlerts @CanadianPacific Can you tell us then if these two jobs have the same code of ethics, then? Because your comments suggest to passerbys that they don’t, but you haven’t outright said it or linked to anything.

@Entropy72 @cnni I simply think that saying "allegedly" once at the beginning of the article is meant to convey that meaning for everything after it. After all it's still just an article for casual readers, not a contract. Journos think of themselves as pseudo-lawyers, but not actual lawyers.
@Entropy72 @cnni Are you saying that if they use the word once, they have to use it throughout? Wouldn't that be redundant?
@Entropy72 @cnni I don't make the seemingly strange rules of journalism, I just know that they exist.
@Yaraduagroup @cnni The article wasn't aware that there was physical evidence of the tweets. I'm sure if they wrote another article that included this screenshot, they wouldn't use the word "allegedly". Make sense?
@Entropy72 @cnni My point is that the word "allegedly" doesn't make me doubt what happened and it isn't supposed to. My argument is *not* that none of those things happened--they definitely did. But journalists are not supposed to use the word definitely.
@Entropy72 @cnni B/c the tweets were deleted, there's no tangible proof. As long as there's a shred of possibility that her admission might not be true, a journalist isn't supposed to state the outcome as a fact. I've seen the word used in even stranger situations, like obvious physical assaults.
@Entropy72 @cnni That word gets used all the time. Afaik, it's the neutral language that journalists are supposed to use because they're only allowed to present things as observations.

@tabithacogitans Duly noted.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf Sorry, but fights have to be fought fairly and logically no matter how passionate you are about them or how wrong your opponents are. OP choosing a specific and misleading example is every bit as nitpicking.
@n8john84 Okay: the directors of highest grossing films are not responsible for their films grossing the highest, and should not be recognized for it at award shows.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf I agree that women are nominated far less than they should be, but OP sounds like she logically deduced that best picture automatically means best director nomination. 		It's misleading because when I first read it, I thought it was unprecedented, until I looked it up.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf It's possible to support a broad concept but call out one example for being illogical, since it can make the overall argument sound weak, which does no good for anyone. "Derailing" would've involved using his disagreement to be dismissive of inequality and oppression.
@tabithacogitans @NFormYourSelf Derailing and disagreeing are not the same thing.
@Alfeo @Aye_Dionne If only that was enough to solve the problem. It’s so much easier said than done to bring up that stuff, especially with office politics mixed in. Even a “uh... ahem excuse me but, I think that might be appropriation/insensitive” can get the person who speaks up quietly laid off.
@pointblaek @studentactivism  https://t.co/rbgFbfgHnd
@n8john84 High grossing films are often the result of more clever or aggressive marketing, not necessarily quality of the film itself.

@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge And "u r" a capitalist tool who believes that because they wanted you to. Like OOoomg.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge Also, what I'd meant was that they could've released every iPhone X feature 7 years ago, but instead choose to trickle it out slowly. So tech companies are not in fact, "too fast" for people. If anything, they're artificially slow.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge 7 years is a bit much. But I know a lot of people who update it every two years and complain about it being above their means.		And "companies...profit" isn't a good enough answer for me. It's still wasteful and selfish, no matter which company does it.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge Lol. Being able to afford one doesn’t mean it isn’t overpriced, or that we should be tossing away perfectly fine smartphones.		They had the technology to produce an iPhone X seven years ago, and the fact that you don’t see through this is exactly what they wanted.
@mickusgaming @MiaCHaight @verge The intervals for keeping that up to date hardware is unreasonable for most people to afford, unlike desktop PCs that serve a greater purpose and require replacement of parts instead of the whole thing.		And we can’t pretend planned obsolescence isn’t pushed extra hard by Apple.

@lporiginalg My friend recently bought a pair of shoes where just the TAX was $250. $112-259 is nothing for a decent pair of boots that lasts years.

@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT A naive interpretation of that stat.		It happens with most undergrad programs (even biology, and even specialized post-grad like law). But animation is an exception--a program that's especially hands-on, demanding, and selective. People don't choose it unless it's career-driven.
All drugstore toothbrushes look like sneakers from the 90s.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT Ha! haha! Yeah, they must be going to animation school to find a husband. 		You're just yanking my chain now, aren't you?
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT There's a difference between girls not being encouraged to pursue certain crafts vs not taking interest or excelling at them (in this case, sorry, but they do).		And I thought the bro argument was that tech is men's territory. Now refined crafts are just men's too? wow.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT If you're going to fall back on "early interest" to avoid thinking about workplace discrimination, most people who decide to pursue animation-related jobs as a career are girls.		And that includes programs with low acceptance rates.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT When have I brought up race in this conversation? I'm talking about gender.
@Raptornx01 @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT I said most animation *students* are girls. Most people with the job position of "animator" are men, yes.
@Raptornx01 @lvmaeparian @beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT I don't think that's how it's happening either. Discrimination is far more subtle than that.
@beaudacious @brooksbarnesNYT Well I think most of them do stay in the industry, but the men are more likely to find their way to shinier places and higher level positions, because, as you said, "I wonder".

@readingquietly Every white person here is at least partly Irish too. So they're not fake Irish pubs, but many are low effort. 		"We're a bar and everything is made of wood and it's dimly lit. We only have chicken fingers but the pub down the street has great Irish food."
@readingquietly It's where an engaged couple raises money for their wedding by having a raffle party. Totally not my thing, but it's very popular in smaller towns around here.
@readingquietly We have bars here too, lol! It's not a terminology difference so much as pseudo-Irish inspired pubs are just more preferred here on game nights.
@readingquietly It isn't blatant pressure though. And certainly not from an alt-right, ha. But it's a social pressure.
@readingquietly Really? I can't say that's my personal experience as a Canadian in Ontario. I'm expected to do the awkwardly-hold-door-for-everyone thing, hold small-talk convos with strangers, attend stag and does even though I find them tacky. These things don't happen in Shanghai.
@readingquietly I just meant the vague superficial culture. Consume mostly American entertainment, dream of owning a cottage, go to the pub to watch hockey.		Immigrants have social pressure to do those things moreso than westerners have to partake in foreign cultural daily activities.
@readingquietly Campuses are their own subculture for sure. I used to get told a lot "it seems like everyone is a liberal, but outside of here, they're not."		But returning to your sea metaphor (which I agree with), western culture has more resilience here, even if there are lots of immigrants.
@readingquietly I feel like reverse assimilation would be if you were in Hong Kong for a semester for exchange or something.		The immigrants who were around you were largely or partly assimilated into /your/ culture already, and there's still more pressure on them to be more like you.
@instantKO lmao!
@readingquietly Of course. I'd like to think most people interested in other cultures don't have ulterior motives.		Most Asian women have been approached by/fallen for a few bad apples and it's enough for us to keep our guard up. But we can also sense when someone's sincere.
@readingquietly What do you make of that, if you don't mind me asking?
@readingquietly I had to stop reading when I saw that part. But early on when she kept making unnecessary and stereotypical physical references to people ("tiny", "73 lbs", "squat"), I knew it'd be bad. Exemplary othering.
@readingquietly By this, I mean that if a westerner emigrated to the East, I would expect no less.
@readingquietly Also, there is a push for assimilation to work the other way, if you look at multicultural incentives. We love it when native westerners take interest in our culture.		We just prefer it to be done thoughtfully, as I imagine native westerners would like too for their culture.
@readingquietly The answer there is in the word immigrants, I think. I adopted Western cultures because it was a way for me to survive and get along, and it also makes people around me more comfortable.		So assimilation does work both ways, but assimilation =/= orientalism
@readingquietly Studying in depth is perfectly fine (even if it's by white men, lol)		*Sometimes* there are white men whose interest in Asian studies are motivated by lust/fetishization of Asian women, which sounds ridiculous, but it does happen. That's the only bothersome aspect I can think of.
@readingquietly @jenniferpadjemi I guess it does often involve fashion statements, yeah, because consumer culture etc etc. The other large aspect is definitely othering, which covers a lot of areas including sex.		You can check out Lena's belittling essay about Japan if you're curious.	https://t.co/7brDD2ubpH
Why doesn't Rowan Atkinson have his own food/travel show on Netflix yet.
@readingquietly @jenniferpadjemi Simply put, it's the emulating+distorting of Eastern culture and "othering" of their people and ways of life, w/o contemplation or compassion.		Modern hipster examples: joking about Asian friends being pocket sized, wearing katakana slogans on shirts without knowing the meaning.
Trump's America https://t.co/ilJ2cD8Mxi
@TeenVogue It's also pretty Orientalist to use Chinese models to "add flare". They're people with career aspirations, they're not seasoning or decoration.		But if that IS what Victoria's Secret is going to do, they could at least respect East Asian beauty standards a little bit.
@TeenVogue Wish they would consider models like Yang Mi, Arissa Cheo, Lilli Lin (to name a few).		There are so many gorgeous models on the non-western part of Instagram who will never be known here because the west has their own expectations of what it means to be beautiful if you're Asian.

@jenniferpadjemi Also, generally subtle racism from hipsters who think they get a pass because they attended a liberal arts school and therefore must be woke.		I've noticed a lot of them fall in line with Orientalist behavior too, but as long as it concerns Japanese things, it's "alright".

@Xiaxue I don't disagree with your theory though. The "meek" thing is true, which is why most guys prefer the "no makeup look" (and are usually, actually referring to THAT). They want the best of both worlds.
@Xiaxue Perhaps that's why people like Katy Perry and Rihanna are considered beautiful even if they have bad complexions/poorly shaped eyebrows  without makeup on.		At the end of the day their bone structures and facial proportions are better and more versatile than most people's.
@Xiaxue Imho most makeup makes us prettier in the sense that we look more polished, striking, and glamorous.		But the intrinsic beauty that we note subconsciously (like bone structure, natural eye size) largely stays the same.
@Xiaxue From a psychological standpoint, I think men can subconsciously tell when makeup (most types makeup application) is responsible for attractiveness, which then signals that the attractive traits are less likely to be inheritable.

@KelloggsUS @saladinahmed So how are they going to modify it? If they make his skin tone lighter, there will be the issue of white being the default. More problems.
@saladinahmed @KelloggsUS This can be pretty common w/ bigger corps. They ask artists to pick a "vague" skin tone that doesn't spark debate. Obv here it didn't work.
@saladinahmed @KelloggsUS But because he's the only human in the drawing, the artist was asked by Kelloggs to make the skin darker, "more inclusive".
@saladinahmed @KelloggsUS But looking closer this is what likely happened: He was intended to be the only human amongst pops (note the clothes, the human nose)

@mila_marshall1 False equivalency and still not an excuse to mock.
@mila_marshall1 But realize that being a sliver of a culture =/= "Chinese culture consumes dog meat"--which implies that a culture celebrates it as a whole.
@mila_marshall1 Yeah I get it now, that it's a "part of our culture" technically, based on a sliver. And if you enjoy mockery based on that, well. 🤷‍♀️
@mila_marshall1 Well, you can keep telling yourself that, but the fact is that very few do it and I didn't even know ppl did it until I moved here. Sorry!
@mila_marshall1 🇯🇵 and 🇰🇷are stereotyped for eating dogs and cats too. But almost none of us do and most of us have a pet dog or cat that we love very much.
@mila_marshall1 And that's exactly what I mean... because of the population in China, when you say "Chinese culture" it *does* get read as "Asian race".
@mila_marshall1 No no I'm referring to Han Chinese, not France.
@mila_marshall1 @RateHowIrate @danielledywong Because it's an ethnic group which is related to race? Anyway, have fun mocking the differences of small samples of people.

@lsedd Btw, I hope you learn to speak nihongo when you visit Japan. It's easier than English so you'll pick it up faster compared to me during ESL.
@lsedd There are definitely ethnic enclaves but there are just as many Chinese immigrants who did bother to learn English.
@DaveWTheThinker I know. I just like posting kpop gifs where appropriate.
@CatholicOpinion Thank you. 🙏 If some people weren't so scared of what they don't know, we would all be much better off.
@CatholicOpinion I think diversity does come with subtle racial divide and tension. Ppl aren't perfect. But my goodness it's not as bad as he makes it seem.
@CatholicOpinion As someone who grew up "outnumbered" I can say: it only sucks if you focus on being outnumbered... or if there's a mean kid in the room.
@CatholicOpinion @ViNeZV2 Well what is your plan then?
@ViNeZV2 Japan has a poor attitude towards foreigners and people are starting to notice. Truth is, that doesn't look good on ANY country. #nobias
@ViNeZV2 @SukhpreetNagpal I'm not sure if you're being facetious as a challenge, but I do actually agree with this. I think every country could use diversity.
@CatholicOpinion You're right, using China as a comparison is totally beside his "point", which makes my response pointless too. Thx for pointing that out.
@ViNeZV2 @SukhpreetNagpal I'm a minority in Canada and that's fine. And if han Chinese were a minority in Shanghai, that wouldn't stop me from living there. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@tylerpistol Don't be, it just deleted the entire Adobe Suite near the end of my work-day. 😫
I guess Windows never considered people might have time-sensitive work more important than sluggish installing of their useless updates.
Two weeks into using a Cintiq Companion and it's all coming back to me why I preferred a Mac.
