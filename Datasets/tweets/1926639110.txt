@lesstaxingcpa So legitimately Ted Cruz was a duel citizen of the US and of Canada, but if he didn’t do anything to claim his Canadian citizenship by his 18th birthday, realistically was only an American at that point, even tho, the press tried making him to be Canadian as well as American
@lesstaxingcpa Between you and I,   The answer is No the children would be citizens of the nation the mother is legitimately a citizen of and under jurisdiction of.   As an example, Senator Ted Cruz was born in Canada, Canada gives children born there citizenship regardless of the mothers home

@gnome_universe @hotfunkytown @survivinglife3 I lived there for 55 years, had moonbeam as gov right after Reagan, he screwed California over then and is doing it on a scale of at least 20x worse then he did in the late 70’s &amp; early 80’s.

@green69 @AmericasMilHist @RCHStudios @Green69.  Within a reasonable distance of Santa Monica Airport ?? Airport was in place before people

@glennbeck to him to his face.    One other thing, I can't believe the NRA actually has endorsed Paul Ryan for re-election.  Rediculous.
@glennbeck    In particular, one little Reince Prebius.   Sniveling little twerp that he is. A total coward, and I have no issue saying that
@glennbeck   For the exact same reasons in the attempt to get closed primaries.  Stupid people are now, seemingly in charge of the RNC
@glennbeck    And this morning Doc and Skip were talking about Ken Cuccenelli, and his walking out the other day, I would have walked too
@glennbeck  to endorse trump. I don't see others endorsing the Cheetos faced jerk.  I'm proud of what Ted did. He said his peace. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍

@rushlimbaugh   north and my Dad was born a couple years later.   He came to the US in 1953, and met my mom in Toledo and they married
@rushlimbaugh    So as a result, my grand parents had to leave, thank god I had a great uncle in Winnipeg Manitoba. So my Grandparents went
@rushlimbaugh   into Detroit and my grandmother came the following October. Quotas for Irish women was full at that point of the year

@AndyVale13    And any little ? That comes up in the vetting process, back they go to where they came from.  Period no re-entry
@AndyVale13     And I was extensively checked before I got my federal firearms license.  The ATF and the FBI ran background checks on me
@AndyVale13     Also, the refugee crap has to stop, particularly with ISIS telling the world they would infiltrate it
@AndyVale13    Back in the early 1930's.
@AndyVale13    And honestly, why should the citizenry not have available to them, as to the military ??  The NFA banned automatic guns

@ColtsFan1971812    That's why I don't pay attention to the MSM
@ColtsFan1971812    No Robin, because it was done by CNN.  And they have demonstrated that they can't be trusted.
@ColtsFan1971812   when they went for Rubio and then trump when Rubio dropped out.  Just the same old MSM.
@ColtsFan1971812    That's a line from CNN, as far as I'm concerned, nothing they say can be believed. I used to listen and watch Fox but

@ColtsFan1971812    to be forcibly removed from that position, but Obozo has her there for just that reason, because she won't follow the
@ColtsFan1971812    Illegals have the "RIGHT" to work in the United States just like citizens do,  now that's just crazy and the woman needs

@judithfuredi    Judith, there you are GROSSLY WRONG. I am from California and grew up during Reagans governorship. He was Republican
@judithfuredi   Do we have any proof that trump will do anything other then what he has done in the past, fund democrats like Schumer  ??

@mj32306 @lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC     And I could just about guarantee that trump voted for Obama.  Both times
@mj32306     As they can be at any time.   States parties make their own rules. That's what is so great about our election system
@mj32306 @lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC    Marion. Not at all.
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Walks away because she doesn't get her way.

@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    Right out of thin air. She has a lot of late (the last couple years) looked buffoonish
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Linda, I won't say anything about the article, because Ann Coulter gets so much crap
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    She has flip flopped like a live fish in a frying pan.  Totally beyond belief
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    I don't waste my time paying any attention to the Crack head Ann Coulter
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    Honestly, what cricked people ??   Those in states that do primaries their way ??
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   At least Cruz is for OUR rights where trump doesn't give a shit about OUR rights at all
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   And I say that because of trumps history of funding every democrat that comes along
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Honestly, Linda, between trump &amp; Cruz, there's really only 1 choice and its not trump
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @Reince    Well, Linda, like I said a little bit ago, trump has to run the field he won't
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Every state does primaries their own way.  The RNC doesn't set those rules, states do
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Like NY where it's a get 50% and its winner take all or those proportional states.
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews     Linda, forget Colorado.  They have done that there for years. Not every state does it
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    And I don't believe he will
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews     Well pretty much the only way trump gets nominated by the numbers is to run the field
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews thanks.     But I had looked at it and recognized what was being attempted to be said
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    Because they see Hillary will kick trumps ass but not Cruz's
@lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   She and her campaign are anticipating trumps nomination, because he seems to have the best path
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC   Well, at least there 2 networks then that ARE NOT in trumps pocket
@lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   That was the NY Primary, not the General Election. They know trump will loose to Hillary
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Linda, I did look at the poll, so don't try to put me down that way.
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews The only thing I worry about is Trump in the White House, he'll be worse then Obama
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   No, what I see is the folks in NY were pissed about NY Values comment

@seanhannity @MichaelCohen212     It's called politics. Remember Abe Lincoln had to go to the 3rd ballot to get the nomination in 1860.
@seanhannity @MichaelCohen212     Run for office and get in there and change it.   Listen to Ted Cruz, we have been doing this since 1860
@seanhannity @MichaelCohen212    Sean, if you don't like the way elections are done in the United States of America, run for office
@MichaelCohen212     He needs to earn his nomination.  He he's short on delegates, then play by the rules and fight it out at convention.
@MichaelCohen212     You know, honestly, does Donald make deals for property and then think he can get away with giving someone less  ??
@MichaelCohen212    And as you just said, if trump is 30 delegates short, No it's not a gime. It has to be earned he knows that. Crybaby
@MichaelCohen212     Trump needs to put his big boy pants on and stop being a little crybaby.   Either Put Up or Shut Up.    Learn your job
@MichaelCohen212    You know Michael, Donald trump is supposedly an adult, he acts like a crybaby with the delegate situation.
