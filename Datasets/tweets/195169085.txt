It's true that we always get the president we deserve. Interpret that any way you want.
@mepfuller And was a state politician before that.

Read, people; just read (books, not just articles on the Internet). I like very old, classic books. Too much Internet is bad for your brain.
At this point it seems many are entrenched with their candidate of choice. Fine. Wonderful. I'm happy for you so no need to be nasty.
If you support @tedcruz or thinking about supporting him, I encourage you to read his book. If you are totally against him then don't read.
Every American should at least read the Introduction to Cruz's book. An example of what your Senators (all of them) do behind closed doors.
I first read @tedcruz's book after @GovernorPerry dropped out of the race. After reading I knew where to switch my support.

I am a lazy voter. Depend on Wikipedia for candidates I'm not interested in, but actually read books written by/about ones I support.
Marco seems like a smooth operator to me. Too chummy with other politicians who American voters are supposedly not happy with.
Marco Rubio is an insider. How can he be otherwise having spent the majority of (wee possibilty time not maybe?) his career in politics?
Marco Rubio has been a politician most (all?) of his adult life. Think he hasn't picked up on how to play the game? More insider than out.
A sore loser or gloating obnoxious winner. I won't choose someone like that.

Carly &amp; Donald have not mentioned to you that very hard times are forthcoming. Why? Because they want you to think they can prevent it.
Why is it that these experienced business candidates are not warning about this? Because they don't care about you. Only their own egos.
