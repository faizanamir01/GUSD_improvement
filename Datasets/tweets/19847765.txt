Consistent with all that is critics, reporters and voters forcing those with radical ideas to reckon with policy / pragmatism / process challenges. But the dynamic of how movements shape politics and public policy is key to understanding what’s happening to Dems right now. ~fin~
Of course, we don’t know how the climate story ends. But we know major social change (you may think it’s good or bad) is often incubated by rabble-rousers who demand something from their own side that’s called radical/unrealistic in real time. Nothing about this is unusual.
Seven years later, DACA has consensus Dem support, is popular with most Americans, and Trump is struggling to kill it. Easy to forget that it didn’t happen in a vacuum. Activists berated the Obama WH until it gave in. Today, climate activists are using the same playbook on Dems.
An analogue to Feinstein and the kids: DREAM activists gave first-term Obama hell &amp; demanded relief (for eg https://t.co/BsignuvbMr). It irked establishment Dems who saw it as counterproductive and told them to target Rs (much like DiFi defenders today).		And then it led to DACA.

The bottom line is Congress needs 2/3rds majorities in the two chambers to block Trump on an emergency declaration.		That’s key because many Rs who are critical of the idea—Rubio, Blunt, Toomey—aren’t currently committing to voting to rescind it.
Here’s the process: If Trump declares a national emergency, opponents in the House and Senate can force votes to revoke it. (It’d be “privileged” so McConnell can’t block a vote.)		If it passes it goes to the president; he can veto it, requiring 2/3 in both chambers to override.
GOP Sen. @MarcoRubio says he's "skeptical" he can support Trump's order.		"Today’s national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal."

White House @PressSec: “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.”

Matt Whitaker gives no indication that DOJ will drop its support for litigating to undo Obamacare in light of Trump's recent promise to protect preexisting conditions.		He suggests that's the president's call.
Matt Whitaker says he doesn't know how many kids have been separated from their parents, and refers to HHS and DHS for specifics.
"I participated in discussions about the zero tolerance policy internally," says Matt Whitaker, without elaborating on his role. "It was General Sessions's decision to implement."
"I don't recall today saying that the border region is crime-ridden," says Matt Whitaker. "It would be lower if we didn't have illegal immigration."
Whitaker's response was that he won't comment on litigation, but there was nothing to stop him from speaking about the issue (which is well within the DOJ's jurisdiction) in broad strokes.
This is quite remarkable given how central the nexus of illegal immigration and crime is to the president's political identity.		https://t.co/cFw1GTAd6J

This @SOTU line is the crux of Trump's political identity—blaming illegal immigration for all sorts of problems in America including "reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."
Trump: "Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally."		And yet: https://t.co/bFJxgCVEsc
Groans all over the House chamber as Trump says "large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States."

Northam says he dressed in “black face” as Michael Jackson for a dance contest, after briefly forgetting Michael Jackson’s name and asking his wife beside him to remind him.
“It is definitely not me. I can tell by looking at it,” Ralph Northam says of the picture on his yearbook page, adding that he’s been told it’s possible someone put a “photo on the wrong page.”
Ralph Northam says he’ll stay on as governor for as long as he thinks he has the ability to lead; if he thinks he can’t, he’ll reassess.		“I have made mistakes in my past, as I’ve admitted.”
“There is no way that I have ever been in a KKK uniform,” Northam says.

So Ralph Northam’s story is that he didn’t know about the racist photo on his own 1980s yearbook page, that he isn’t the person in the photo, and that when he took responsibility for it he was merely apologizing for the “content,” not admitting he’s in it.
“I am not the person in that photo.”		Ralph Northam says he didn’t know that photo was on his yearbook page and never saw it until yesterday.

@guypbenson Depends on definition. She sounded fine with barriers like Normandy fencing and vehicular stops
Basically, Democrats will support money for various border security items (but not a concrete or steel barrier); Trump can call it a "wall" and declare victory while Dems say it's not a wall.		Question is whether he can accept that or whether he needs them to call it a WALL.
Pelosi lays out an endgame here, saying Dems will give Trump money for border personnel, tech, ports of entry to add to the cliffs, river, fencing already there.		"If the president wants to call that a wall, he can call it a wall," she says.
Pelosi categorically rules out "wall money" in the DHS legislation but says funding for border technology, infrastructure and adding ports of entry are "part of the negotiation."
"There's not going to be any wall money in the legislation," says @SpeakerPelosi on conference negotiations.

Kamala Harris's exit music for her 2020 launch in Oakland is My Shot, written by @Lin_Manuel, from The Hamilton Mixtape.
"We know what the doubters will say," says Harris. "They'll say it's not your time. They'll say wait your turn. They'll say the odds are long. They'll say it can't be done."		(Which doubters? Harris is widely viewed as a frontrunner for the D nomination.)
This Kamala Harris line best sums her campaign message: "We treat attacks on voting rights and civil rights and women's rights and immigrant rights as attacks on our country itself."
A Democrat runs on tax cuts: Kamala Harris says she'll "deliver the largest working and middle-class tax cut in a generation" and pay for it by reversing the Trump tax breaks for corporations and top 1%.
An interesting line from Kamala Harris in Oakland: "The word 'unity' has often been used to shut people up or to preserve the status quo. When women fought for suffrage, those in power said they were dividing the sexes and disturbing the peace."
Kamala Harris in her 2020 launch speech: "Racism sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia are real in this country, and they are age-old forms of hate with new fuel. And we need to speak that truth so we can deal with it."
.@KamalaHarris speaks in Oakland: "Under this administration America's position in the world has never been weaker—when democratic values are under attack around the globe, when authoritarian is on the march...when we have foreign powers infecting the White House like malware."
On @FaceTheNation today 👇		MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the president really prepared to shut down the government again in three weeks?		MICK MULVANEY: Yeah I think he actually is. Keep in mind he's willing to do whatever it takes to secure the border.
Thing is, there are immigration issues that divide Democrats and could be an effective wedge for Trump to use — ICE, sanctuary cities, guest-worker visas. A border wall isn’t one of them.
It’s not much of a mystery. A border wall polls poorly nationwide and in blue/purple areas that House Dems (and the GOP rebels) represent. Add to that an unpopular shutdown that voters blamed on the president and Ds had even less incentive to cave.		https://t.co/zH08RQlIfL https://t.co/tUZKh9zch2

The speed at which many Trump allies who walked the plank for 35+ days are now flipping reveals how little conviction there is in Congress for this wall fight.
@DemFromCT yes he did
Yeah, Democrats "win" this standoff, but they weren't demanding anything. Only one side (Trump) was demanding something controversial (wall) as the price of keeping government open. That's the asymmetry in this whole fight.
NEWS: Mark Meadows, a key figure who pushed Trump to force the shutdown, doesn't oppose the deal to reopen the government without wall money. https://t.co/gtUMgIx7NA
TRUMP issues an ultimatum, saying that if there's not a "fair deal from Congress" by Feb. 15 there'll either be another shutdown or he'll use his powers to address the wall (which sounds like a national emergency declaration).
What happens on February 15?
So 35 days into the shutdown, there'll be a short-term deal with no wall money, which could've been done to avoid all this in the first place.
Trump says hes asked Mitch McConnell to put the 3-week CR on the floor immediately and that federal workers will soon get back-pay.
Trump says the short-term government funding deal is through February 15.
TRUMP: "We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government."
There's no wall money in this agreement, per the 3 sources, but there is a vehicle to go to conference on a DHS bill and debate border funding.
Deal afoot, per three Hill sources: short-term bill to reopen the government for about three weeks.		1st calls it a "tentative agreement," 2nd says they're "zeroing in on an agreement," 3rd says "there will be an agreement." They stress that nothing is final until Trump signs it.

@RachelLarris Manchin voted for D plan as well
Senate vote on Trump plan: 50-47	Senate vote on Democratic plan: 52-44		Both fail to get 60, both are rejected.		Government shutdown continues into Day 34.
NEWS: Senate votes 52-44 for the Democratic plan to reopen the government without wall funding. That's short of 60, so it fails.		The Republicans who voted YES:		Lamar Alexander	Susan Collins	Cory Gardner	Johnny Isakson	Lisa Murkowski	Mitt Romney
It's currently 51-44. Unless somebody switches to NO, the Democratic plan to reopen the government without wall money will get more Senate votes than the Trump plan that includes wall money.
ROMNEY votes YES on the Democrats' plan to reopen the government.
Martha McSally sticking with Trump here, votes NO on the Democrats' plan to reopen the government without wall money.

@DLind Fair enough. What I’m trying to get at is that‘d require creating a new program. If it’s legally enforceable it’s no longer “DACA” - if it’s not it doesn’t necessarily mean much
@DLind Is that a legally enforceable right? Under what parameters?
How would the 3-year DACA protection work legislatively?		There’s no existing program in law to “extend.”		Would it be lawfully-enforceable “legal status”? Or executive grace?		If it’s the latter, what’s to stop the administration from rescinding the work permits if it wants to?

"I never worked for Russia &amp; you know that answer better than anybody. I never worked for Russia. Not only did I never work for Russia, I think it's a disgrace that you even asked that question because it's a whole big fat hoax, it's just a hoax," Trump says, per @margarettalev.

Presidents were never previously blamed by the public for government shutdowns. Donald Trump is a trend-setter in this regard.
By contrast...		2013 shutdown: 52% blamed Republicans in Congress, 34% blamed Obama (CNN poll, 10/18-10/20/2013).		1995 shutdown: 49% blamed GOP leaders, 26% blamed Bill Clinton (CNN poll, 11/14/1995).		https://t.co/9ZP0hed8Q2

WHERE WE ARE		The House and Senate are gone until December 27th.		Trump is dug in on wall funding.		GOP leaders are standing by him.		Democrats have no desire — and no political incentive — to cave on the wall.		There are talks but no apparent path forward to re-open the gov’t.
Mick Mulvaney says “very possible” the government shutdown continues into the new Congress.
MULVANEY suggests the shutdown could go on for a while.		“I don't think things are going to move very quickly here the next couple of days.”
White House budget director Mick Mulvaney defends the shutdown on @FoxNewsSunday: “This is what Washington looks like when you have a president who refuses to sort of go along to get along.”		“You are seeing a fight over border security.”

The question for Democrats is whether they’d prohibit the use of fungible “border security” money for concrete or steel barriers.		For now that sounds like a yes.		But if the “wall” means fencing, repairs or technology that’s not off the table, per D sources. https://t.co/noNY8bPEXy

A filibuster nuke might've made sense early IF Republicans were intent on using full control to privatize Medicare and make the 2011 @SpeakerRyan budget a reality. But for a $5 billion wall? Days before Dems take the House and render it useless?
Another reason McConnell likes the filibuster: plenty of Rs (including him) represent states reliant on federal dollars that are tricky for conservatives to defend ideologically. Better to bring home the bacon under cover of bipartisan deals "necessary" due to the 60-vote rule.
And in the near-term there’s stuff like this, via a former McConnell aide.		https://t.co/TWnATBdH30
The Senate filibuster is the barrier between the left and its utopian American of Medicare for all, free college and no fossil fuels in their dream scenario of total Dem control.		That’s why Mitch McConnell has constantly refused to kill it and why he won’t do so for a $5b wall.

5 DAYS from gov’t shutdown... White House’s immigration point person Stephen Miller makes a rare Sunday show visit to dig in on the wall. Schumer vows Trump won’t get a wall “in any form.” Republicans are cautious not to contradict Trump, who hints at reviving family separation.
White House adviser Stephen Miller told @margbrennan today: “We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall.” And that means a shutdown? “If it comes to it, absolutely. This is a very fundamental issue,” he said.
Schumer was asked to respond to this tweet, from his former aide, on MTP: “Look, you never know how a judge is going to vote, ten years later. But this was an awful, awful decision. And it has to be overturned.” He added: “There was no deal, I don't think, on this judge.” https://t.co/KGHMN8Ly4s
More @SenSchumer on @MeetThePress: “Many are for Medicare for all. Some are for Medicare buy-in. Some are Medicare over 55. Some are Medicaid buy-in. Some are public option. We're going to have to do a lot more on health care. It will be a major issue in 2020.”

@StephenGutowski @MST3Ketchum Right. Obama’s policy wasn’t zero tolerance; he applied criminal proceedings (which is what causes the separation) selectively to people like drug dealers. Trump’s policy required that for all

McConnell: “We’re trying to get the president the money he would like for the wall” to the tune of $5 billion in the gov’t funding bill.		He stops short of drawing a red line.
Mitch McConnell isn’t budging on his opposition the Mueller protection bill.		“This is a solution in search of a problem,” he says. “The president is not going to fire Robert Mueller.” 		He says he “probably would” block a vote if Flake et al. call it up again.

McConnell won't say if he wants Jeff Sessions to run for his old Alabama Senate seat (now held by Democrat Doug Jones), but says it's the GOP's only real pickup opportunity in 2020 and he'd like to have the seat back.

Mitch McConnell, asked if the Senate will act after the CA shooting, says it's "highly unlikely there will be restrictions passed" at the federal level on gun ownership.
McConnell on whether he'll allow a vote to protect the special counsel investigation:		"It's not necessary. The Mueller investigation is not under threat."
McCONNELL won't say if Matt Whitaker should recuse himself from Mueller probe:		"I don't have any advice to give the administration on that," he says, positing that it'll be a "very interim" appointment and "I expect we'll get a new nominee quickly for the job" of AG.
McConnell sees a "rural-urban divide" all over the country.		Republicans "need to do better in the suburbs. I'm really happy with how we're doing in rural areas," he says. "That's particularly helpful in the Senate."
Rep.-elect Jennifer Wexton (D-VA) won't say if he'll support Nancy Pelosi for Speaker when asked twice by @SRuhle.		"I'm going to wait and see what my choices are."

Trump says he won't disclose his tax returns while they're under audit.		IRS procedure is to audit a sitting president's tax returns, so that's his way of saying he'll never release them until he leaves. There's nothing stopping him from doing so.		https://t.co/efZs1rAYgJ
Trump says he doesn't want to release his tax returns, when asked what he'll do if Democrats pursue them: "They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them," he says. "People don't understand tax returns."
Trump won't say if he'll fire Sessions or Rosenstein: "I'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. We're looking at a lot of different things, including cabinet... We're looking at different people for different positions." Also hedges on Zinke.
Trump is threatening Democrats not to investigate him by suggesting he'll go after them if they do. "They can play that game, but we can play it better."

Latest #TX23 count shows Will Hurd (R) leading by 689 votes.
Republican senators up in 2020 include Collins (ME), Gardner (CO), Tillis (NC), Cornyn (TX), Ernst (IA). Other than Doug Jones, Democrats have it easier.		You can imagine a scenario where Dems win the WH &amp; House in 2020 but the Senate stays GOP and thwarts the president's agenda.
For Senate Republicans, the value of padding their majority isn't passing bills (it takes 60 and Dems can still filibuster), or judges (it takes 50 and GOP dissent is next to non-existent); it's protection from a rough map in 2020.
Jacky Rosen wins in Nevada and knocks off Senator @DeanHeller, AP and NBC project. A rare bright spot for Senate Democrats on a rough night.

Trump, doing his best Winston Churchill: "We will not bend. We will not break. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. And we will never surrender."
Donald Trump just called on his supporters "to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division."
Trump in Indiana urges his base to vote to send a message to the left. "I do eventually want to unite. But the fact is we're driving them crazy. We're driving them crazy. They don't know what to do. They're going loco. Loco!"
"This is the greatest political movement in the history of our country," Trump says of his presidency. "I don't even think it's close."
(Or two, or six, as the case may be tomorrow.)

I hear things like 'everyone agrees on pre-existing conditions and the debate is about the rest of Obamacare.' Sorry, that's gibberish. It's policy-illiterate and ignores the fact that conservative alternatives in Congress universally cut down on those regulations.
@NoahCRothman In my convs, activists know this; they see it as an opening bid that’ll end in public option/Mcare buy-in or something like that
To channel @philipaklein... 8 years of repeal efforts and rather than argue for their alternate vision (fewer mandates, lower costs for healthier ppl), Republicans have rhetorically conceded the premise of ACA.		Pre-ex rules aren't ancillary to the dispute, they're central to it.

As others note: There’s no “fight” to force insurers to cover pre-ex conditions. ACA already establishes that they cannot charge sick people more &amp; must cover a set of benefits. The “fight” is over whether to keep those regs (as Ds want) or loosen them (as Rs like McSally want).

In other words, House leaders appeared to recognize the political danger in weakening pre-ex rules even as they pushed to repeal much of the ACA. But they did what was necessary to pass the bill, which was to undo some of those regs.
The original Ryan-backed House bill in 2017 largely preserved ACA market rules. The Freedom Caucus opposed it so couldn't get the votes. Then came MacArthur-Meadows amndmt that weakened pre-ex protections (to lower costs for healthy people). And then the bill passed the House.

McConnell tells Bloomberg News the rising deficit under Trump (now $779b) is "disturbing" and argued the problem is Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — which he lamented are "difficult, if not impossible" to cut "when you have unified government."

“I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions,” McSally says repeatedly in tonight’s AZ debate.		To unpack this, the bill she voted for barred insurers from turning away preex patients but permitted state waivers that’d let them charge those consumers more for coverage.
Helluva line from Arizona GOP Senate candidate Martha McSally tonight: “We cannot go back to where we were before Obamacare, where people were one diagnosis away from going bankrupt.”		She voted for the AHCA, which repealed Obamacare.

Recent history tells us that if your goal is lower deficits, your best scenario is a Dem White House + GOP Congress, and the worst scenario is an all-R government.
A remarkable trend that continues. Since 1981, the U.S. budget deficit has grown under every Republican president (Reagan, Bush I, Bush II, Trump so far) and fallen under every Democratic president (Clinton, Obama). https://t.co/HKYNTanCfU

Trump’s 60 Minutes interview ends with this, re: his reflections on being president of the United States.		***		LESLEY STAHL: And you feel comfortable?		PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I feel very comfortable, yea.
A remarkable line from Trump when pressed on @60Minutes whether he thinks he was respectful to Dr. Ford: “I'm not going to get into it because we won. It doesn't matter. We won.”
Trump on @60Minutes claims that his rally remark mimicking Christine Blasey Ford ensured Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to SCOTUS.		“Had I not made that speech, we would not have won. I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything,” he says.
Trump says the U.S. was “unbelievably polarized under President Obama” but now “I can see the country uniting.”		He doesn’t cite evidence of this except to say ”I can see it.”
Trump reflects on @60Minutes about being a politician: “They're babies, the political people. This is the most deceptive, vicious world. It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception. You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.”
Trump defends his family separation policy on @60Minutes: “Frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are going to pour into our country.”		He doesn’t rule out re-imposing it.
Where President Trump is setting the bar on Russia/collusion (tonight on 60 Minutes): “Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election? Give me a break. They wouldn't be able to help me at all. Call Russia. It’s so ridiculous.”
On @60Minutes, Trump refuses to pledge that he won’t shut down the Mueller investigation: “I don't pledge anything. But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that.”
Trump refuses on @60Minutes to say if he’ll fire Jeff Sessions. “We’ll see what happens come midterms.”		Side note: POTUS has a tendency to talk about administrative decisions as though he’s a spectator (“we’ll see”) rather than the bottom-line decision maker.

The disapproval measure on the HHS short-term plans rule just deadlocked 50-50 (Collins voted with Democrats), so it fails to pass.

Quick fact-check: The president has championed 1) House and Senate legislation that’d chip away at preexisting condition protections, 2) a pending lawsuit that’d wipe out the ACA in its entirety, and 3) new regs to expand short-term plans that don’t have to abide by pre-ex rules. https://t.co/dB1ySRO5xu

Justice Kavanaugh hit the ground running on his first day on the Supreme Court bench, asking numerous questions and engaging in several back-and-forths with lawyers in two sets of oral arguments.
Kavanaugh, sitting on the far right of the bench, was chatting and laughing with new seat-mate Elena Kagan before the session began.		At the end, she shook his hand and he smiled and mouthed “thank you” before the justices left.
Anthony Kennedy is seated in the Supreme Court audience, robe-less, wearing a suit and tie for Kavanaugh’s first day on the bench.
Just left the Supreme Court chamber. Kavanaugh spoke ~25 minutes into his first session as a justice to ask a skeptical question of a lawyer for a criminal defendant.		His wife, kids and parents were in audience.		No protests or disruptions during the first half of the argument.
Now chants of “We do not consent!” and “November 6 is coming!” https://t.co/OwZnYAoDSI
