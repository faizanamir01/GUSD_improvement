I missed the first half of your tweet. My apologies. I still disagree. But my RT grossly misrepresented your position. I’m sorry! https://t.co/xwJUXaZeGm
Just realized this. Deleted. My apologies. https://t.co/RDayl5GX44
@JustinSalhani Exactly. I often have to correct people who do it.
“Ras alabd” means “head of a slave.” It’s what Arabs in many countries use to describe chocolate covered marshmallows. And “abd” absolutely means slave. The fact that you think it just means a black person only underscores my point. https://t.co/ueezkDeaHE
Now that’s too far. For example, “black” Palestinians are far from second class citizens. Is there racism? ABSOLUTELY. But it’s not to that extent. https://t.co/xBXC3WwvXG
@fouadromieh I can speak to my own experiences in Egypt, Morocco, and Palestine. But it’s common in many places.
Interestingly enough... one of the most clear and explicit instances of racism in the Middle East emerges when folk talk about marriage. It’s very telling. https://t.co/NLvWQNp57q

@primaryomar @JGreenbergSez Again, those families will stay right there. Everyone should have the same citizenship, same vote, same resources. Same safety. Equal rights for everyone.
@ComplexGent When I travel to the Middle East, particularly places like Egypt, Arab Muslims often talk to me about West African Muslims not being as authentic. Does Islam teach this? Nope. Of course not. Quite the opposite. But it plays out within Muslim spaces.
@ComplexGent I’ll give you an example. When I lived in an entirely Black Sunni community, many of us thought that an Arab (or even white) imam was inherently wiser. We struggled with anti-blackness ourselves. Did Islam teach it? No. But it played out in how we practiced.
@ComplexGent There is sexism on construction sites. There’s nothing sexist about the construction business, as such. But there are cultural practices that play out in those spaces. Yes, they’re linked to other factors, discourses, influences, etc. Same here.
@_BilalJamil I didn’t judge all people or all communities. But anti-blackness is something I see in many places. And it’s something we must take seriously. But if you pretend it doesn’t exist then it won’t change.
@primaryomar @JGreenbergSez I want everyone to have equal rights, equal freedom, and equal access.
@ComplexGent And again, I’m not saying Islam causes it. That was never what I said.
@ComplexGent I’m also talking specifically about Muslim communities, including ones in which I’ve lived and practiced. We’re just going to agree to disagree on this one.
@ComplexGent There are, for example, Muslim alcoholics. This is a fact. That doesn’t mean that Islam teaches alcoholism. It means that you can be of a religion and not honor its principles. Same for racism.
@ComplexGent You realize that this is exactly what I wrote, right? I literally said Islam doesn’t teach this, but it’s still present.
@rnuseibe Of course.
@primaryomar @JGreenbergSez Except... I never said that.
@SteveDeeb3 @AllSrx @raqqawi So you’re saying that no Muslim is racist? Ok. Let’s agree to disagree.
I never said Islam is a race. But communities aren’t just racial. (For example, we’re having a conversation in an online community.) And I never said Islam was anti-black. I said there is anti-Blackness within Muslim communities. This isn’t negated because there are black Muslims https://t.co/q4aDWVmqR1
@AllSrx @SteveDeeb3 @raqqawi Exactly. Otherwise you don’t have to be accountable for racism. We can just say “they’re not really one of us.”

I never said you did. Your individual character or beliefs don’t change the fact that there is anti-blackness within Arab and Muslim communities. This doesn’t mean everyone feels that way. And it doesn’t mean that Islam teaches it. But it’s still there. https://t.co/41PB8OKS3r

I definitely have critiques of the piece. I’ve laid some out in my tweets. But I also think it’s worth an effort to engage different sides in GOOD FAITH dialogue rather than merely dismiss it. https://t.co/c0YO6I8Fpj
@Cryptonia10 You think I’m saying that?
Also, it isn’t incorrect to have a abstract/theoretical/conceptual critique of the broader project. This, of course, should be based in policy. But it’s absurd and anti-intellectual to say that words like “settler-colonialism” are off limits. https://t.co/C23rCRtxyd
The article demands specific policy critiques, which is reasonable. But it wrongly implies that this isn’t what mainstream activists and critics are doing. Are there some who don’t? Absolutely. And that’s wrong. But this isn’t the norm. https://t.co/C23rCRtxyd
The biggest problem with the article is that it reduces any fundamental critique of Zionism as inherently anti-Semitic. And it dismisses a refusal to accept the “equal blame on both sides” argument as inherently problematic, rather than an acknowledgement of power imbalances. https://t.co/C23rCRtxyd
I’m on my third listen of Solange. I’m enjoying it more each time.
Hopefully we can create space for honest, good faith dialogue. Those of us who love justice absolutely hate anti-Semitism. We must battle it at all times. This isn’t (and shouldn’t be considered) at odds with the call for Palestinian freedom, justice, and self-determination. https://t.co/C23rCRtxyd
I read the article and agree with much of it. The points of difference are nuanced and require dialogue. But we agree that there are important lines between legitimate/principled criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism. The former is necessary and the latter is always unacceptable. https://t.co/C23rCRtxyd

The Harper deal, though, wasn’t just about x’s and o’s. He brings monetizable star power. I see how it makes financial sense for the Phillies. But it’s still hella risky toward the end of the deal. We’re paying him until 2032!!!!!
I’m excited as hell to have Bryce Harper here. He gives us the bat, and star power, we needed as me move from rebuilding to contention. But 13 years and $330 million with NO OPT OUTS is a lot for anybody. But it’s super dangerous for someone who batted less than .250 last season.

@ynkutner @elderofziyon I’ve tried to have a civil and respectful conversation. I also offered to send you this info. You don’t seem interested in either. I wish you peace. Have a wonderful day.
@ynkutner @DylMeisner @elderofziyon And anti-Black racism is very much alive in Palestinian (and broader Arab) society. That’s also a story I tell, even though many deny it. For example, that community in Jerusalem is called “Habs Al ‘abeed”. Explicitly racist language in Arabic. I take that head on.
@ynkutner @DylMeisner @elderofziyon And I’m not weaponizing anything. Israel, like the US, has a wide range of racial groups and it’s an interesting story to tell. Different groups have different experiences. Some positive. Some not.
@ynkutner @DylMeisner @elderofziyon You’ve never seen a Black Bedouin? You’ve been to Rahat? What’d you see? You’ve been to Be’er Sheva? It’s not hard to find.
@ynkutner @DylMeisner @elderofziyon Walk into Tulkarem Camp today. It’s indisputably African in demographic character. And none of them will tell you their families started there. They’ll say they were moved there after 48.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon Also, when you say “Arab Bedouins” you ignore the significant interactions and mixing (through slavery and other processes) between them and African tribes. Go to Be’er Sheva or Rahat right now and ask the Black Palestinians how long they’ve been in the region. They’ll tell you.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon Send me your email. I’ll send you full interviews with people who fled in 48 as children from these places. They’re indisputably African and they trace lineage back hundreds of years.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon No evidence of existence? They’re literally still there. The idea that you’re disputing that Black Palestinians lived inside the GL long before 48 is also out of step with every scholarly account. It’s simply untrue.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon And black Africans are absolutely not living in Jerusalem. That too is factually untrue. There are only 200 people of this sort in the Old City. Far more Afro-descendants in Gaza and Jericho.
@DylMeisner @ynkutner @elderofziyon There are entire bodies of scholarship just on African people inside of the green line throughout history, especially in Bedouin communities like Rahat and Be’er Sheva. The fact that I know and study these people for a living only makes this debate more absurd.
@DylMeisner @ynkutner @elderofziyon If you want to believe that African people didn’t exist in the region prior to 48, or that the only ones there were pilgrims that got stuck, then go ahead. But it’s an absurd claim that no scholar on any side of the conflict would support.
@DylMeisner @ynkutner @elderofziyon How? Because he posted an article about Jerusalem to challenge a claim about Tulkarem?
@ynkutner @elderofziyon There are other Afro-descendants who have lived there much longer. For example, Jericho is filled with folk who trace back many generations. Same in Acre, Rabat, etc. No scholar or citizen of these areas disputes this.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon You’re completely missing the point. I’ll say it again. There are multiple African populations in the region. Some, like those in Jerusalem, were 19th and 20th century pilgrims. Although that’s not the whole story of them either.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon The people in Tulkarem camp come from villages in Israel: Haifa, Jaffa, Kissaria, etc. they lived there long before 48. Many, particularly the Bedouins, trace their families back hundreds of years. They were forced out in 48 and moved to the refugee camp.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon You’re confusing 2 different groups. The Afro-Palestinians of east Jerusalem are not who I was just referring to. They arrived in Jerusalem during the mandate. They have nothing to do with the Tulkarem people I just mentioned.
@ynkutner @elderofziyon The entire village of Tulkarem is filled with people of African descent living within the Green Line. They moved to Tulkarem afterward. This isn’t even a disputable thing.

@kdog0126 Again, there was no public demand for them to give him felony time. I’m calling for the same sense of mercy and justice here.

@YungGodMarquis Please reread what I actually wrote, dickhead. I never said he wasn’t in Brazil. And I never said he wasn’t charged. I said that there was no PUBLIC DEMAND for those charges.
@topflightdj Again, I said there was no PUBLIC DEMAND for charges. He was charged in Brazil. But there was no PUBLIC DEMAND for it.
@charstarwilson He lied about while sober. Days after. Stop.
It’s sad that, for so many who live within this American punishment state, we cannot imagine justice outside of criminalization. Accountability doesn’t mean punishment. Punishment doesn’t mean confinement. Justice requires restoration not cages.

Right. And my whole line of conversation is about me not wanting him locked up. Sooooooo, much to your chagrin, we are actually in agreement. https://t.co/328IBCL3ux
I pray you’re smarter than this too. I  there was no PUBLIC DEMAND for him to be hit with felony charges for the Rio incident. Media personalities were calling him a “kid” who made a mistake. https://t.co/GnFM1tjSMN
We can treat people who make mistakes humanely. We can hold them accountable without putting them in a cage. This doesn’t make him a “victim.” It makes him a person. https://t.co/4J7JA086l8

Holy talking points, Batman! I’m not defending anyone’s behavior. I’m calling for a different approach to accountability. https://t.co/cupjso0U59
This isn’t whataboutism. I’m saying we treat different people differently. I’m all for accountability, but it must reflect justice. A felony conviction and prison time doesn’t feel just to me for his alleged crimes. https://t.co/lw4dkStdoC
Remember when Ryan Lochte got caught lying and people demanded that he be charged with felonies? Oh right... That didn’t happen... Accountability doesn’t mean criminalization.

@KcFloWBro1 @Buccigross No. The argument is that there’s an entire industry profiting from their labor: tickets (primary and secondary), apparel, tv, etc. Everyone is paid but them.
@ALearnersBurner Right. But he said “keep the money UNLESS they graduate,” which means that they won’t get paid for what they do unless they get the degree. Thats different than holding money until they’re a certain age. That’s what I objected to. Sounds like you missed the point.
@Moore_Darnell @hfdavis He walks into these jokes!
@ALearnersBurner I understood his point. My point is that they should get the money even if they don’t graduate.
@ALearnersBurner I didn’t mention slavery. I’m talking about wage labor exploitation
How is this an argument for NOT exploiting someone? https://t.co/lO5WqyeQdN
@ALearnersBurner What point did I miss? He said they don’t get paid unless they graduate. My point is that they’re being exploited for their labor. Even if they don’t graduate, they should get what they earned.

@RealSimbalism I’m simply talking with record right now. They’re in the hunt with plenty of time left. And they’re in a comparably better position than Houston. Yet we still put Harden in the convo.
The challenge is that they’re on the same team. It’s tough to get mvp consideration with so many stars. https://t.co/XDNFBOiY0c
Sixers are time for 4th and a game out of third. Houston is in 5th place in the West with a worse record. And they certainly were expected to be at the top of the conference standings. Again, Embiid shouldn’t win MVP. But his numbers are in the mix. https://t.co/nhSuaa7VLS
Embiid averages more points and rebounds than Giannis. His defensive numbers and +\-s are strong. It’s not crazy for him to be in the MVP convo. Should he win it? No. I think Harden and Giannis should be the leaders. But it’s not crazy to mention him.
Embiid should be in this convo too. https://t.co/OqkOJwBlGD

@Pathdom The construction of race as a thing that renders someone an “outsider” is entirely socially constructed. He asked what race the attacker was. The idea that a black American, for example, is not of the same sort as you is a modern construct.

@DucadiSpalato I didn’t say Bernie shouldn’t speak. I said Bernie speaking wouldn’t help him win the votes he needs to get the nomination. I said it makes him LOOK racially tone deaf. I also said NOBODY running for the nomination should do it.

@unspokenbond How have I defended them? I said it’s bad strategy for Bernie, presuming he wants to win the nomination.
@DucadiSpalato You said that you disagree with me and I’m black. You’re saying I’m wrong because I’m black? See how dumb this type of argument is? I’m saying it’s bad strategy for Bernie to speak. He can do whatever he wants. I just don’t think it’ll help him with voters.
@bauhvvs When was I in the Democratic Party?
@DucadiSpalato No. I’m saying that it’s bad optics for anyone running for the Democratic nomination to do a response after Abrams’ response.

@mcbyrne Well I certainly haven’t been one of those people. And my tweet doesn’t suggest that. Responding to everyone like in that manner makes his supporters look thin skinned.
@SocialistProg I never I said I was being attacked. Where are you getting this from? I said that some Bernie supporters are acting like I MADE an attack. And I said the optics are bad. It’s not just about Stacey, it’s about the perception that he won’t align with dems
@johnsconiers I’m not sure how I’ve communicated surprise. I’m just saying I think it’s bad strategy.
@EJRaoulduke1976 Why do you think I’m mad? I said it’s a bad strategy given what’s happening this year.
It’s stunning how many Bernie supporters take a sincere critique as a vicious attack.
@Marcusw224 Why do you perceive this as an “attack?” Why not just a constructive critique of the optics related to his choice?
He has no choice? Huh? The argument isn’t that he should give the official response. It’s that he could just not give a response. https://t.co/DuwqOXjx1h

@parallelcircle What does my vote in 2016 have to do with the accuracy of my analysis of Bernie today?
On an historic night for Stacey Abrams and the party, as we enter election season, he could make a different choice. This isn’t about his intentions. It’s about how his choice is going to be read by the people he needs to secure the nomination. https://t.co/jev8tJwCZz
Yep. This totally refutes the whole “racial tone deafness” thesis. https://t.co/3OHUJ2rnKJ
This is a bad move, especially assuming he’s going to run. It only reinforces the idea that Bernie is not serious about representing the interests of the Democratic Party. It also reads as racially tone deaf, as Stacey Abrams becomes the first Black woman to deliver the response. https://t.co/l7PLxUo7BI

I just don’t don’t know how to have a competitive league without a draft system. https://t.co/QAQlouKkIU
I disagree. I think the NBA is the company, not the team, in this analogy. Players are agreeing to work in the NB after graduation. As a condition of that employment, they have to play for the team (company branch) that hires. https://t.co/QAQlouKkIU

@surferturfer @TamikaDMallory You’re just throwing accusations. When I respond with facts. You only offer more accusations. I respect your opinion. But you are not correct in your assessment. Wishing you peace.
@surferturfer 4) check out my writing on Saudi. Also, I did a year of coverage of the atrocities in Syria. In my 20s, I focused almost exclusively on Mauritania and Sudan. What you’re saying simply isn’t accurate.
@surferturfer 1) I did mention abuses in other M.E. countries. Please watch the speech 2) the event was about Israel/Palestine, which is why i focused I focused on Israel/Palestine 3) I’ve done far more activism and journalism about other countries
@surferturfer I actually don’t support 21 Islamic states. To the contrary, I don’t believe that Islamic states should exist. I think they’re anti-democratic. I understand this is a talking point. But it doesn’t apply to me.
@surferturfer No. I want a single democratic secular state with democratic voting rights for everyone. If other options are explored, then they must create freedom and equality for all sides.

@dadatka If I say “until we address wealth distribution, we’ll always have poverty” that’s not justifying or legitimizing poverty. It’s pointing out causes.
@dadatka 1) you specifically said that I justified violence one side. Not both sides. That simply doesn’t make sense. 2) I’m not making conditions for fighting bigotry. We should do that always without conditions.
Appreciate you so much Danny https://t.co/om6n5tB4WE
@Red_Pill_NYer @CampusWatchMEF @TempleUniv Perhaps you should read the actual quote.
@dadatka I said Palestinians in the same sentence. How am I not doing same for them? And again, I’m saying no one will get the outcome they want until we figure out a solution. That’s not legitimizing anything.
@dadatka Nope. And by your logic, why wouldn’t I be doing the same for Palestinians?
@JkrHAHA Huh? You just won’t admit that they misrepresented my comment. But it’s cool. Be well. Peace.
@JkrHAHA It was a dishonest report. They left out key words and framed it as a threat rather than a call for democracy.
And sadly, it happens every day on various levels. https://t.co/i2OO4SjP9Z
@JkrHAHA My answer : a key argument for the Jewish state is that if provides safety for Jewish brothers and sisters around the diaspora. If that state is unstable because of the conflict it has impact for the whole world.
@JkrHAHA They acted as if I were issuing a threat rather than saying that a democratic solution is in everyone’s best interest.
@JkrHAHA I’m happy to answer that. But are you honestly saying that they accurately reflected my statement?
@surferturfer I posted the exact quote from the transcript. What was the lie?
Exactly. Unfortunately, people often believe headlines and don’t read content. https://t.co/WfCaoh4UD2
As the actual quote suggests, it wasn’t a “warning” (or threat). Nor was it directed at one side. It was a call for democratic solutions. https://t.co/h8R0VibZqt
My actual quote: “we’ll never have a world of safety and peace and justice not just for Palestinians but also Israelis and Jewish ppl around the world until we figure out some solutions that work for everybody. And we can’t do that if ppl aren’t speaking in democratic practice.” https://t.co/h8R0VibZqt
What dishonest take. What I actually said is that no one on any side of the issue will be able to get the peace, freedom, and self-determination they deserve until we find workable solutions rooted in democratic practice. https://t.co/h8R0VibZqt

This isn’t a case of throwing rocks and hiding hands. I genuinely believe in the arguments and principles that I shared in the speech. I also genuinely want peace, freedom, and security for everyone. These are not competing ideals and values.
My reference to “river to the sea” was not a call to destroy anything or anyone. It was a call for justice, both in Israel and in the West Bank/Gaza. The speech very clearly and specifically said those things. No amount of debate will change what I actually said or what I meant.
I support Palestinian freedom. I support Palestinian self-determination. I am deeply critical of Israeli policy and practice. 		I do not support anti-Semitism, killing Jewish people, or any of the other things attributed to my speech. I have spent my life fighting these things.
I normally would ignore the current drama, but it’s actually important to me that I’m clear and understood. As a matter of principle.
I did not. I have not. And I would not. https://t.co/2Imr32XWws

@TristanNovak1 @mehdirhasan Perhaps you should read my work on Saudi. Or the activism I did in Sudan. Or the whole series at HuffPost I did on Yemen and Syria. I’m curious about where you determined that I was only talking about Israel.
@AaronBBrown The speech IS posted. Text and video. You’re simply lying.
It’s also ABSURD and illogical to suggest that a speech that explicitly called for redrawing borders and granting full citizenship for Palestinians IN Israel was also calling for its destruction. People either didn’t listen to the speech or they’re being dishonest.
The phrase dates back to at least the middle of the British Mandate and has never been the exclusive province of a particular ideological camp. The idea that this is a Hamas phrase is simply untrue.
Anyone who studies the region, or the history of Palestinian nationalism, knows that “river to sea” has been, and continues to be, a phrase used by many factions, ideologies, movements, and politicians.
I concluded my remarks with a call to free Palestine from river to sea. This means that all areas of historic Palestine —e.g., West Bank, Gaza, Israel— must be spaces of freedom, safety, and peace for Palestinians.
Unfortunately, we are in a moment where any critique of the Israeli government is called anti-Semitic. Any call for Palestinian freedom is seen as an attempt to diminish Israel freedom. This does not have to be, nor should it be, the case.
While I have my own beliefs about one vs two state solutions (I prefer one), it is not my job as an outsider to decide for Palestinians or Israelis. Regardless of the resolution, however, Palestinians cannot be denied freedom, self-determination, or human rights.
I believe in full rights for all citizens. I believe in safety for all citizens. I believe in self-determination for all citizens. This is not an anti-Semitic position.
In my speech, I talked about the need to return to the pre-1967 borders, to give full rights to Palestinian citizens of Israel, and to allow right of return. No part of this is a call to destroy Israel. It’s absurd on its face.
Yesterday, I gave a speech at the UN in which I critiqued Israel’s polices and practices toward Palestinians. It’s baffling how people are not responding to the critique, but instead responding to things I didn’t actually say.
It doesn’t make sense because it’s absurd. https://t.co/xCvb4SwolK
True. https://t.co/dRJi0jEI3p
@ElyBelly1 I have a huge problem with Hamas. I’ve been consistent on that.
@DrPhilGoff Absolutely nothing. Cc: @DumiLM
@NewportAntifa @jaketapper @brianstelter @CNN Huh? I called for a single democratic state where everyone votes. Jews, Muslims, Christians and everyone else deserve to live in peace and safety. And with self-determination. No one’s freedom should come at the expense of others.
That’s because I didn’t say it. Lol. https://t.co/bKe1goccuj
The 20% minority of Palestinians living in Israel are systematically denied access to equal rights. From free speech to housing to family reunification. I’m speaking about concrete laws currently on the books. https://t.co/0A4icpTEFt
At no point did I endorse, support, or even mention Hamas. This is dishonest. I was very clear in my comments about desiring freedom, justice, and self-determination for EVERYONE. https://t.co/6jFN22mTcq
This is silly. And inaccurate. “River to the sea” is a phrase that precedes Hamas by more than 50 years. It also has a variety of meanings. In my remarks, which you clearly didn’t hear, I was talking about full citizenship rights IN Israel and a redrawing of the pre-1967 borders. https://t.co/6jFN22mTcq
You’re right. It’s frustrating at times, though, because I forget that not all people engage in good faith. https://t.co/2ZFER0OSc4
@JAlfredPrufro13 Not at all. I want everyone to coexist in a single democratic state. One person. One vote. Not one person needs to leave, live unsafely, or not have full rights and freedoms.
@vcvenus Of course.
It’s really sad that this is the level of discourse. I actually critiqued Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia in my remarks too. Of course, you didn’t bother to actually listen. In reality, I want the same rules for everyone: equal rights, freedoms, and safety. https://t.co/uU2zGpy7z1
I don’t. I believe in secular democratic states. https://t.co/4oeXLGTmoo
Ummm. That’s absurd. I called for freedom and equal rights for all citizens, irrespective of race, religion, class, gender, or sexual identity. No one should have greater or fewer rights and privileges in a democracy. It’s quite simple. https://t.co/bT3EMowWQ9
I also discussed how the Trump Administration’s policies are undermining peace and justice. At the same time, I pointed out the ways that American Middle East policy BEFORE TRUMP has also failed the project of peace and democracy.
In my remarks, which also marked the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I addressed the various ways that Palestinians are actively being denied access to basic human rights.
Today, I spoke at the United Nations, as a representative of civil society, for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. It was truly an honor.
@NJames813 Nope.
There was a great deal of two state talk today at the UN. I think my one state allusions were, at best, a minority position. https://t.co/0qLqFa1ArR

Saric is a big loss. But he’s also replaceable much more easily than Jimmy Butler. The Sixers needed a 3rd elite player and someone who could take the rock and get a bucket. https://t.co/T52nczepFZ
@kev_cudi_ 68% of his shots are 3s. Last year he shot 37%from 3. This year it’s 39%. That’s very good.
@CalvinStevensJr Even if that’s true, PFs these days can stretch the floor. You’d have the same problem at another position.
Still, Butler gives the Sixers someone who can create his own shot and be effective on both ends of the floor. The Celtics dismantling of us in the playoffs demonstrated how badly we needed it.
Right now the Sixers are without a real option at PF. Chandler can fill in there and Simmons can defend at the 4. But we need a real stretch 4 to make us formidable in the half court.
As happy as I am that the Sixers got Butler, it’s not a perfect trade. We lost 2 solid young rotation guys. Covington is an all-world defender and very good shooter. Saric is a very skilled and tough stretch 4. They both bought in to the program.
Of course. I just think Boston is better than the Bucks. That’s not a controversial opinion. https://t.co/hiFOtVPimg

Black people are the only group who are demanded to throw people away, rather than critically engage and challenge them. Regardless of what headlines say, that is not my position.
Although I disagree with the Minister on those important issues, I will not allow that to be an excuse for allowing dishonest media or poorly intentioned observers to create unnecessary division. I will not be told who to speak to, sit with, or engage.
My disagreement with Minister @louisFarrakhan on LGBT/Jewish issues is principled and sincere. We see the world differently on those issues, as well as specific comments that the Minister has made recently.
One of the first things @LouisFarrakhan said to me was “I know we disagree on some big issues. But you’re still my brother.” He was referring specifically to LGBT issues, but we also discussed the question of anti-Semitism in depth.
In that meeting, we discussed many things: our religious and political formation, current politics, music and more. We agreed on many things. We had profound disagreements on others.
The picture came from a meeting that I had with Minister Farrakhan in 2016. He invited me to listen to a new project and discuss a range of issues.
The last 24 hours have been crazy. I have been getting challenged from many directions based on an old picture of @LouisFarrakhan and me that emerged. A lot of misrepresentations have been made. So I will speak for myself.

@osvaknin Rings hollow? You repeatedly asked a question. I answered it. And you’re essentially saying my answer doesn’t matter. You’re committed to believing what you want. I’ll have to leave it there then. Peace.
@BJones1982AD No. I was annoyed that he only pointed to ONE SIDE. I made that clear. You can’t just tell one side to “behave.”
@BJones1982AD Disagreeing with Israel is not anti-Semitic. Supporting resistance to the occupation is not either.
@BJones1982AD I do support self-defense, as inscribed in international law. I’ve been very clear in my writing about this.
@BJones1982AD I don’t condone it. Never have. Never said I did.
@osvaknin @HAKIM__kO @DekeOmally @CNN @BET But I’ve never said they were ok. I’ve repeatedly said the opposite: they’re not ok. They’re anti-Semitic. And I don’t support them. This came up in our conversation. But you’re saying that just having a conversation is wrong, even if we disagreed. That’s nuts to me.
@BJones1982AD Disagreeing with Israel is not anti-Semitic. It’s a political, moral, and ethical disagreement. I support non-violent resistance. But I also acknowledge the right of occupied people to defend themselves.
@BJones1982AD I also oppose our funding of Saudi Arabia. And Egypt.
@BJones1982AD No. I never called for defunding. I do, however, oppose the occupation of Palestine. And I think that US tax dollars should not support Israeli’s illegal occupation, settlement expansion, etc.
@BJones1982AD Name one thing I’ve ever said that was anti-Semitic.
@osvaknin @CNN @BET This picture is from years ago. No one disputes that. Facts have to matter.
@ArthurSchwartz @CNNPR It would depend on the context. I wouldn’t look at a picture and make assumptions. But even if you think I would, I’d be wrong to do so. And it’s wrong to do so now.
@peeshkid @JosephWulfsohn Yes. It says that this is the country/region that I professionally study. And write about.
@peeshkid @JosephWulfsohn I only criticize Israel? Wow. So no basis In facts, huh?
@JosephWulfsohn @LouisFarrakhan That’s not what I said in 2008. I said I didn’t know. And I said that because I hadn’t done research at that point. You’re being dishonest.

@Da_Milkman15 @barbasuperstar 1) the critique came at the end of his administration, which is why I said he ignored it for 7 years. Your point doesn’t conflict with mine. 2) an abstention on a clear moral issue is not a principled vote. It’s a pragmatic one
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @barbasuperstar Actually I didn’t. I specifically said ALL US presidents. Obama inherited a decades long mess in North Africa.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @barbasuperstar Rather than calling me names or insulting my expertise, feel free to actually address the point I made.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @barbasuperstar And I never said trump and Obama were the same. I said that we shouldn’t romanticize previous administrations. I also said that his ME policy wasn’t principled. Pointing out some of his better moves doesn’t negate that point either.
@Rev_Nev_Lewis @barbasuperstar His points were not responsive to mine. I said that we shouldn’t romanticize Obama’s or any other president’s ME policy. Pointing out the Iran deal, which i agree with, doesn’t nullify my point.
@barbasuperstar So what did I say that was untrue?
@barbasuperstar The Obama-Saudi arms deal? Explain that too...
@barbasuperstar How was he principled in Libya? How was the UN vote or virtual silence on Israeli settlements for 7 years principled? How was the response to Syria principled? Stop it.
Because Trump said it. Or do you think he’s lying? https://t.co/wKPUD4Dbew

@BambiThePhoenix I’m not defending him. I’m saying it’s assault. He clearly intended to grab her. She did not consent. It’s unacceptable, regardless of whether he intended to touch her breast. My point is that his “intent” is irrelevant.
This. https://t.co/dvasqsczVq
Sure. They play a role. But so does religion, which precedes rap by... forever. So since we’re talking about the church, let’s avoid throwing rap under the bus. https://t.co/eaAVTy9PQd

@DocPotterGS That’s not what I said. Clearly, I’ve communicated poorly. I apologize. If you’d like to talk offline, I’m open. You can educate me.
@DocPotterGS That’s not what I said. I’m saying that “intent” isn’t exculpatory. I apologize if I’ve communicated something different.
@DocPotterGS I’m not defining rape culture. Im drawing on the language of women activists and scholars. And I’m not making excuses. I’m saying the opposite. I’m saying it inexcusable, and that his “intent” doesn’t give him a pass either way.
@vaswanijuhi To be clear, I’m saying the fact that he didn’t intend to commit assault is part of the problem. He doesn’t think anything is wrong with it, which means these violent actions probably happen all the time.
You don’t. I was saying that we’ve normalized rape culture. The pastor probably went home thinking what he did was ok. That’s a reflection of rape culture, which erases consent and creates a sense of entitlement over women’s bodies. That’s why i say his intent doesn’t matter. https://t.co/b56ZZVPoeu
@DocPotterGS How am i apologizing for it? I’m saying it’s assault and it’s wrong. My point is that his intent is irrelevant. It’s assault either way. Also, rape culture is so pervasive that his ideas of assault, etc. are grossly skewed. What exactly are you disagreeing with?
I’m capable of being simultaneously outraged. https://t.co/kB9HgotYxu

@beauzaq I think he intended to touch her. I don’t think he thought what he was doing was assault. As I’ve been writing, that doesn’t make it better. In so many ways, it makes it worse. This is just how he moves in the world.
Also, the pastor’s “intent” is colored by rape culture as well. He truly may not notice her pulling away or looking uncomfortable. But this is because he’s been socialized not to seek or affirm her consent. This is all part of the awful violence. https://t.co/zHuW56hOjy
You’re really gonna die on a sexual assault hill, huh? https://t.co/Ukcr4jWIo5
Very true. https://t.co/l4lxL0UjTO

@DocPotterGS She said stop? Wow. I didn’t know that
YES!!!!!! you have to ask permission before you touch people’s bodies, even in church. Actually... ESPECIALLY in church. https://t.co/mlsMKnCMxa
@tashalharrison I actually think it’s worse. I think he wasn’t even paying attention to her discomfort or squirming. Another feature of rape culture.
@no1important701 A joke on her behalf? So if someone makes a racist joke, only the people in the conversation have a right to be offended? Also, she’s not Latina. Why would her feelings be prioritized over those who were the butt of the joke?
I don’t think he did it on purpose. But it’s still problematic. One way to prevent it is not to presume the right to touch people without permission. https://t.co/oNPVUSL72q
Wow. This is scary. https://t.co/EeaKpYlteM
He certainly made an anti-Mexican joke in front of 10 million people. Sometimes people make bad choices in public. https://t.co/pWoId6fh0m
OR... rape culture is so pervasive in our society that he didn’t see anything wrong with touching her without her consent. People don’t necessarily think he INTENDED harm. That doesn’t make his choices less problematic, though. https://t.co/pWoId6fh0m

@taylornb @jackjonesbabe The “peace process” is a post-Oslo myth that has only led to more Palestinian suffering. Every US president has been complicit. You can reject my analysis as simplistic, but you’d have to tell me which part is simplistic.
@taylornb @jackjonesbabe Netanyahu has no interest in a peace process. And the US has no leverage to stop settlements without withholding funding, which is a non-starter. Anyone holding on to a mythic “two state solution” is part of problem.
If you love Lauryn Hill, or Miseducation, make sure you grab @milfinainteasy’s new book “She Begat This.” It’s amazing.
Today is the official 20th anniversary of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. I still remember waiting outside of Tower Records on South Street at 11:59:59 to buy the CD. Time moves.
This video makes me happy. I still want to see more jumpers. https://t.co/xeV9jQj5IP
RT @divafeminist: True. Also, this “policy” is racist-sexist. So what are the next steps from all of us? https://t.co/feVPBc4frB
@jackjonesbabe Exactly. Because her position is indefensible. Peace.
@jackjonesbabe Also, saying that settlements are an impediment to a peace deal is NOT challenging settlement expansion. That’s absurd. It’s also morally suspect.
@jackjonesbabe And your focus on a minor part of the convo —which was about Hillary’s despicable position toward Palestinians— is the actual deflection.  Her position is indefensible so you try reduce a conversation to something not central.
@jackjonesbabe Let’s say you’re right. Why would that be me “lying?” Why wouldn’t I just be wrong? That’s why it’s ad hominem. And to be clear, you are not right.
This. https://t.co/6TRk8FU10o
@School_Project @realDonaldTrump Lol. Yep. Because that’s totally what happened.
@jackjonesbabe You win. Hillary challenges settlement expansion. And Palestinian rights. And an end to the siege in Gaza. And right of return. Palestinians would be better under Hillary. I lied about the whole thing.
@jackjonesbabe Im done because i don’t do ad hominem.
@jackjonesbabe Hillary, like other US presidents, senators, etc., has taken a strong pro-Israel position. Her speeches and policy endorsements substantiate this. She’s not worse than them. But she’s not better. This was the convo
@jackjonesbabe No. You’re changing the context. The convo was about Hillary being better on Palestine. Every president has given lip service to settlement expansion. None have challenged it. This isn’t difficult.
@Peace4all17 Lol. You can continue to tweet fake or misleading headlines. Whatever makes you feel better. But the facts are there.
@jackjonesbabe You can disagree. But just because I see it differently doesn’t make me a liar. Anyway, I’m done.
@jackjonesbabe Yes. Obama and Bush and Clinton said the same. But there was no policy response. No withheld budget. No teeth. Not even an affirmative UN vote, along with the rest of the world.
@queerBengali I never said any of that. I had a critique of Obama policy. I also have a critique of Hillary and Trump’s campaigning on the issue. I don’t blame her for US policy. I never did.
@RidgelyVikkie @jackjonesbabe Lol. I said I’d make sure Hillary wouldn’t win? Wow. Lol
@ReginaA1981 @vexedinthecity 1) most Americans DO want to change Palestine policy. I’m open to evidence to the contrary, but the polls and data underscore this point. 2) I’m not hanging anything on Hillary. I was responding to a point about Hillary being better on this issue.
@jackjonesbabe No. I tweeted a critique of Trump. There was no mention of Hillary. Someone then responded about Hillary. I answered. This is probably my first tweet about her in a year. How’s that an obsession?
@msleen1970 Obsessed? How many times have I tweeted about Hillary in the last year? I mentioned her yesterday because someone brought her up specifically.
@Peace4all17 I keep doing it? Really? Where? Show me.
@mrsmaris I never said they were the same. That’s a lie.
@jackjonesbabe How does that answer my question?
@lynnv378 Solid argument there.
@jackjonesbabe Except I didn’t say that. And how am I obsessed with Hillary? Someone raised an issue about her and I answered.
@reesetheone1 I did not. Voted Green in both.
@lynnv378 I slammed Hillary? Or did I respond to someone who brought up Hillary?
@iloanya1 My point wasn’t largely about Obama. That said, the US sat on its hands for 7 1/2 years on Palestine under obama. It didn’t stop settlements expansion or the siege in Gaza. To the contrary, its aid enabled  it.
@RaphaelCurtis13 It is the myth of the 2 state solution that has allowed Palestinian land to be stolen and more rights violated. The fact that it lingers in the “abstract” is all the more reason why it’s problematic.
@RaphaelCurtis13 What does it mean to support 2 states in the abstract? How is this better for Palestinians?
RT @KeeangaYamahtta: Get your copy of this book! https://t.co/jyOk5lGCBX
@vexedinthecity @Hebahersi @dcentralized That’s a long way of saying that you made a claim about Palestine that you couldn’t back up when challenged on it. Instead of just conceding, you change the subject. And you convince yourself that your holding some moral high ground.
@vexedinthecity @georgemelies192 Right. And this has nothing to do with the convo, which is about Palestine. And you’re smart enough to know that.
@pultuskpa @Shugah @vexedinthecity Of course she did. Hillary is awful on Palestine.  This is indisputable.
@vexedinthecity @georgemelies192 Lol. I’ll continue to wait for a substantive answer to my question on Palestine. Or a concession that this was a bad example of your argument. Or a concession that you don’t know enough about this topic to make a cogent argument that Hillary would be better. Night!
@TauhidNYC @vexedinthecity My point exactly. That’s why I said Palestine is the wrong hill to die on regarding a pro-Hillary argument.
@hannaallison_ @vexedinthecity In fairness, he’s not answering because he’s not knowledgeable on this topic. Frantic googling will only reveal that Hillary’s history in Palestine is despicable.
@iViPod @vexedinthecity He can’t.
@georgemelies192 @vexedinthecity Exactly. But he doesn’t know anything about this topic. He’s just using this as an opportunity to grind an ax about a Green Party vote. But this is the wrong topic to choose.
I’ve abandoned the Palestinians? Wow. Lol. I suspect they’d disagree. That said, Palestinians were devastated under Obama and Clinton policy. Disagree with my politics and voting. But Palestine isn’t the hill to die on in defense of Hillary. It’s just not based in fact. https://t.co/0Q0OG9F5jK
Ok. What’s the basis for this claim? Clinton’s own words, policy, and long history on the issue say otherwise. If I’m wrong, show me proof. Any. A more honest answer is that you don’t know anything about Palestine policy and you’re using my tweet to grind an unrelated ax. https://t.co/VtYp0LNxrM
@vexedinthecity What does this have to do with Palestine?
@vexedinthecity I asked you how Palestinians would have been advantaged by Hillary. You mention deportations. I’ll give you another chance: how would Hillary have been good and/or better for Palestinians? Please be specific.
Also, Clinton gave an IDENTICAL pro-Israel speech in front of AIPAC. She is unabashedly pro-Israel. To suggest that a Clinton presidency would’ve been a “practical”  Oxford for Palestinians is dishonest or uninformed. https://t.co/sZVexEPODN
This is dumb. Hillary Clinton had/has an awful record on Palestinian rights as a candidate and Secretary of State. She supported the continued funding of the occupation, defended the devastation from Gaza in 2014, and has not challenged settlement expansion. https://t.co/sZVexEPODN
@vexedinthecity How would Hillary Clinton have been better for Palestinians? Be specific.

@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies I totally get it. I’ve been in stores that didn’t carry mine. It’s frustrating.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies @AmalgamPhilly And yes, I suspect your book had already sold when you got there. That said, you should also consider doing a talk at the store. We could then bulk order and draw new eyes to it. We want to support you. We always have.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies @AmalgamPhilly We’re happy to do that. I wasn’t ignoring that point. I was responding to the idea that 1) we didn’t support the book; and 2) that there’s no excuse no to carry it. We love and support your work. I was just giving context.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies I understand that you’re offering to give us a personal discount. But i had no way of knowing this at the time. We bought them the way we buy all books. And we sold them. We’re happy to support and get more.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies We didn’t have your book featured with those because we sold it. And couldn’t get more because fulcrum didn’t ship more for 2 months. And we can’t bulk order it bc they don’t give us the the discount.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies @AmalgamPhilly I said fulcrum didn’t offer a discount. I then said “same for most university presses.” I was drawing a comparison. I wasn’t calling fulcrum a university press.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies We sell both of your books. Did we sell them when we opened? No. But we got them. And we sell them. Even though we lose money on the deal. We do this for most black scholarly books. I want to understand. What would you like us to do differently? I’m happy to do it.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies I also pointed out that your books, like many scholars, don’t give us a discount. So we’re being expected to  sell the book at a loss, which we’ve done.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies I thought your issue was that we didn’t carry your book, even after you pointed it out to me. I responded by saying that we typically don’t deal with that genre, only what’s sent. Once you told me, we ordered and sold it.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies Perhaps I’m misunderstanding. What’s the issue? I really want to understand.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies @AmalgamPhilly I just checked. We ordered 5 copies of your book in Feb. They shipped 3. We sold them all. The next 2 didn’t come until April. And again, we lost money on the sale. Same for most university presses. We do it to support folk. But we do have to balance that with paying our bills.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies @AmalgamPhilly But your book was there during that time. We ordered and sold several copies. What do you think would have been a reasonable number of books to carry?
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies So, although we actually do carry your book, i don’t think it’s fair to say there’s “no excuse.” As an independent store, it’s a challenge to sell a book that causes us to lose money because the publisher doesn’t give a retail discount.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies We’ve carried the “encyclopedia of black comics” for 7 months. We’ve been open for nearly 9. Fulcrum, however, doesn’t give us a discount. This means, after shipping, we sell it at a loss.
@DrSheenaHoward @WorldProfessor @UncleBobbies We’ve only been open 8 months and do not sell comics. We never have. The only comic we sold was Ta-Nehisi’s series because it came to us automatically. We deliberately don’t sell comics in order to support @AmalgamPhilly. We direct everyone there.

@siessdav I said two. Things. 1) it’s inappropriate. And 2) its an uninformed opinion.
@siessdav You think it’s appropriate in an Aretha Franklin obituary to mention that Kelly Clarkson is a better singer?
But there are reasonable standards. There’s reason to believe that Kelly Clarkson is more versatile than Aretha, who sang pop, r&amp;b, jazz, blues, gospel, and opera. You can LIKE Kelly more, but it’s an absurd to take to say the former. https://t.co/R77kerKra3
@RAtheRuggedMan Bruh. I had to reread it. Crazy.
If you feel the need to mention who you like better than Aretha Franklin as a singer, you probably shouldn’t be writing her obituary. If you think Kelly Clarkson is a better and more diverse singer than Aretha Franklin, you probably shouldn’t be writing about music.

I loved how formal Aretha Franklin was. There was no pretense or haughtiness to it. She referred to you as Dr. or Reverend or Mr. because she thought we deserved those titles. And I never fixed my mouth to call her Aretha. She was ALWAYS gonna be Ms. Franklin.
Aretha Franklin was always very kind to me. In that old school auntie kind of way. She would always say how proud she was of our generation.

And Aretha’s remakes! What she did to “Respect” or “Until You Come Back To Me” was masterful. Not just vocally, but her reworking of the entire arrangement. No disrespect to Otis Redding or Stevie Wonder, but she made it all hers.
And Aretha’s riffs on “Mary Don’t You Weep.” Lord.
Aretha Franklin’s “Amazing Grace” is still the greatest gospel album ever made. It was the soundtrack to so many Sundays in Black America.
RT @DianaRoss: I’m sitting in prayer for the wonderful golden spirit Aretha Franklin.
Although Aretha Franklin garnered unparalleled success as a singer, people never fully appreciated that she was writing, arranging, and playing too. She wasn’t just a magical voice. She was a MUSICAL GENIUS.
Aretha’s Columbia music never was fully appreciated for its genius. Her reworking of standards was masterful. What Aretha did on “Skylark” was other-worldly.
America has never heard a voice like Aretha Franklin. She was the greatest singer our country has ever seen.

Right. But your argument presumes that he had to choose between a weak move and a weaker move. He could actually make a STRONG move. https://t.co/cf6lVeUUEC
But MJ isn’t “damned if he do.” The point is that he never DOES. How much would it take to say “I disagree with President Trump’s comment”? Jordan has never taken a position that will upset anyone, which is exactly why Trump prefers him. https://t.co/GYNTfelc89

The @NFL and its owners have already conspired to blackball @Kaepernick7 . Their next step is complete erasure. But we cannot let this happen. We must make it clear that we will not rest until we see justice.
The NFL and EA could have chosen not to use that song. Instead, they decided to blank out Colin Kaepernick’s name. This is a deliberate act. They’re sending a message. So should we.
I hope @EAMaddenNFL is prepared to answer questions about why Colin Kaepernick’s name is off the game. This isn’t a harmless or neutral move. It’s a provocation.
So they’ve edited Colin Kaepernick’s name off of the Big Sean verse on the Madden 19 soundtrack. They barely edit profanity off the games. But his name must go?

@StopBDS_PSFC Israel had 2 official languages in practice. Even radical Zionists affirmed this in its founding. It has now been demoted from official language to special status. Ironically, I was at the Knesset, when this was being debated. So yes, I do know what I’m talking about.

@joe_kehoskie When did I say that?
Now let’s slide to Section 7. It normalizes settlement expansion without qualification, which violates international law. It also frames settlements as “Jewish communities,” which enables (continued) discriminatory housing practices. https://t.co/J63l6UzT5H
On to Section 6. My issue isn’t what it pledges to do, which is protect Jewish people around the world. It’s that it doesn’t pledge to ALSO protect vulnerable non-Jewish populations within Israel. For example, a Muslim CITIZEN has less protection than a Jewish non-citizen. https://t.co/J63l6UzT5H
More on 4... Arabic’s official demotion is part of an ongoing state project to erase The Arab presence in the country. This is evidenced in school curriculum, road signs, and state discourse. https://t.co/J63l6UzT5H
Let’s now slide over to Section 4. ARABIC has now been demoted to “special status.” In addition to enabling discrimination, this violates the spirit and explicit language of Israel’s foundation. Specifically, Zionist founders said this would be a country of 2 languages. https://t.co/J63l6UzT5H

@PureManhattan Ok. We’re not gonna agree. Also, if you think Lebanon or Iraq, for example, are apartheid states, we probably won’t agree there either. Enjoy your day.
@PureManhattan We’re all over the place. First, do you acknowledge that whose countries refuse ALL Israelis, just not Jewish ones? Yes or no.
@shute_says @Realtimewithme8 And yes, I meet strangers all the time. Just not strangers from the internet who begin an interaction by telling me that they don’t like or respect me. You can honestly think it’s unreasonable that i wouldn’t go and meet this person in real life just because they asked.
@shute_says @Realtimewithme8 Of course I could’ve said neither. I was saying that the old “have you stopped beating your wife?” question doesn’t set the table for healthy or civil debate.
@PureManhattan Also, those countries aren’t banning Israeli Jews. They’re banning ALL Israelis. Arab Israelis also can’t enter those states. Again, it’s wrong. 100%. But that’s not how you define apartheid
@PureManhattan Also, I’m not sure how you’re defining “apartheid state.” But not allowing citizens of another country in to visit does not meet the definition. Is it wrong? Yes. 100%. But that’s not how apartheid is defined.
@PureManhattan I was asking what countries have I not uttered a word about.
@PureManhattan Like?
@cucciakrystin Absolutely. That’s why we must look at the evidence in each case and not take people’s word for it.

@JamesAGagliano No one disputes that she’s been convicted. I’m saying that it was a wrongful conviction. I’m happy to go over the case and show the evidence. What’s your basis for saying the jury verdict was correct?
@shute_says You didn’t answer my question.
@tjack411 Huh? When was the “first place?” When did I NOT state that I believe she’s innocent? SHOW ME.
That’s. My. Point. Juries get it wrong. https://t.co/toSOonGEDj
@dbenilevi I accept it. I disagree with it. I accepted OJ’s. I disagree with it. I believe both were guilty. Juries get it wrong sometimes.
Shout out to the white people who point to the jury verdict as “proof” of Assata Shakur’s guilt, but still can’t accept OJ’s “not guilty” verdict two decades later.
@shute_says Honest question. Have you done any real research on this case? Do you honestly feel informed enough on this issue to claim guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?
Unless, of course, you’ve studied the case rather than doing a quick google. Research, including the medical evidence, clearly shows she was wrongfully convicted. But even if you disagree, it’s dishonest to suggest that I’m supporting the alleged crimes. I’m arguing innocence. https://t.co/7HzwL9QliI

@jfreewright Bro. I wish you could see how loud I’m laughing.
@yngfalafel Right. That’s very different than Palestine. Many Afro-Palestinians are firmly entrenched in the land. Sometimes since the Ottoman Empire. If you come here, you’ll see a very different landscape.
@yngfalafel I think Jordan and Palestine are different in that regard. Though many Jordanian Africans used to spend a lot of time in Palestine. Especially before 67. But even later. Like I said, it’s def complicated.
@yngfalafel But your initial claim is that it didn’t “feel African.” I think spending the with them might make you feel otherwise. Particularly among those who are 2nd and 3rd generation. They’re deeply entrenched in Palestine but also tethered to Africa.
@yngfalafel These folk are less prominent in Jordan. However, the “Ghoranis” in Jordan also have strong Afro-Arab  on connections. It’s pretty real.
@yngfalafel I think it’s very complex and diverse. There are whole communities of Afro-Palestinians, which I study, who have been here for nearly a century. They hold onto their particular pieces of African culture, but are also woven into Palestinian culture.
@yngfalafel I didn’t call the land African. I called THEM African. If you’re African and grew up in Jordan, why wouldn’t the people here who were born in Nigeria and Chad be African?
@yngfalafel You know Africans have been here for a very long time right?
Spent the day in Jericho. Such a beautiful place. I always feel at home here. I see and feel so much of Africa here.

@girlwiththafro It’s nuts. There are some people who will call any criticism of Israel policy anti-Semitic.
@DaerWartyna Yes. You’re reading it wrong. I said that he SHOULD be critiqued for his actions. And that those actions promptly suffering, etc.
@DaerWartyna I’m not understanding your point. I didn’t say not to critique. I actively said the opposite. I said let’s critique and engage him. I also didn’t say that critique reinforces apartheid. I’m not sure where you got that from.

@AngryScreed @ShaiBrill This is literally the first I’ve heard of it. Send me info.
@MichaelCraig18A Ew. Your anti-Semitism is showing.  You can critique Israel without impugn Jewish people. That’s disgusting. Shame on you.
My final thought on this: We should critique Draymond for going on an IDF tour. Doing so normalizes an apartheid state and intensifies he suffering of Palestinian people. But our first move should be to engage and inform. Not to “throw him away.”
Word. https://t.co/Oq470aZ3VR
@MaryContraryyy I’m saying we should criticize him. But not just throw him away. We should actively try to engage him in the issue. It’s worked in the past with other athletes. If it doesn’t work, that’s something else.
@MmmQuarks @ShaiBrill I see how I wasn’t initially clear on that point.
@MmmQuarks @ShaiBrill I don’t think one has to agree with me to be informed. But I have a pretty good sense of his particular politics.
@MmmQuarks @ShaiBrill This is based on my knowledge of his politics and reasons for boycotting the White House. Also, my expertise with other pro athletes. It’s not a general claim about his ignorance.
@ikambiz Similarly, you disagreed with me and the first thing you did was essentially call me a sell out and accuse me of being indifferent to the atrocities happening. We have to be more generous with one another.
@ikambiz My experience is that many celebs are brought on these tours and aren’t aware of the issues facing Palestinians. We can critique him. But we should also try to educate. We can’t just throw people away.
@ShaiBrill Then argue the facts. You’ve presented no facts. You’ve only said “you’re wrong. You don’t know anything. I lived there.” That’s not an argument.
No. Going on a publicity tour for the IDF is a bad choice. https://t.co/IlH7mmzMj5
@ShaiBrill So telling me that you lived there doesn’t make you any more or less right. And if I live there for 20 years it doesn’t make me any more or less right. Anyway, I’m done. You got it. Peace.
@ShaiBrill You’re arguing a straw man. The point wasn’t that firsthand knowledge has no value. It’s that it’s not a trump card in an ideological debate. The region is filled with lifelong residents who have different opinions.
@goeljasper I don’t desire to win. I just find terms like “ignorant” to be insulting. As someone who works here and does research here, I’m confident that my perspective is informed. Even if it’s different than yours.
@Sean177Sean I disagree, bro. And I find blanket negative claims about Jewish people to be anti-Semitic.
@ikambiz Yes. And won several awards for it. Also writing a book on it. Also raised funds to support them. Literally just left them two days ago. Now what?
@ShaiBrill No. I’m saying that you can’t say “I’ve been there” as a trump card to shut down debate. By that logic, Mahmoud Abbas could say “well I’ve been here for 82 years” so I know more than both of you. It’s not a legitimate rejoinder.
@ikambiz Huh? Do you know my work? You realize that’s exactly what I write about and fight, right?
@goeljasper Dude. You called me ignorant. And said I made blanket claims. I asked you to justify your remarks. It’s far from semantics. But cool. Peace.
@ShaiBrill No I didn’t. I said that going there doesn’t make you right. Not that it makes you wrong. Please reread the exchange. My whole point is that many people go and they don’t all have the same opinion. Going isn’t relevant.
@ShaiBrill No. I’m saying that I’ve been here to show the fallacy of your logic. Me being here doesn’t lend or strip credibility. It’s not relevant. Also, you specifically said I didn’t have experience here. I was correcting that factual inaccuracy.
No, my brilliant friend. I’m saying that going to Israel doesn’t make your argument any more correct.  Conversely, your argument wouldn’t be LESS correct if you hadn’t gone. It’s beside the point, my fellow MENSA brother. https://t.co/quJpOu3SeE
Dude. You’re saying that your opinion is correct because you’ve been to Israel. The flaw in that argument is that many people who have gone to Israel DISAGREE with you. As such, you cannot appeal to that experience to win a debate. #logicalfallacy101 https://t.co/dXdul5LY07
@goeljasper I’m not following your argument. Yes, I’m assuming that he’d make a different choice with more info. This is based on my knowledge and experience. How is that problematic or reflective of a blanket claim?
@ShaiBrill Also, do you really believe that everybody who’s lived there agrees with you? If not, respectfully, that argument makes no sense.
@ShaiBrill I’ve been working and researching in the country for several years. How is that not firsthand?
@goeljasper Yes. That’s based on my experience with athletes. That’s not a blanket or unreasonable claim. It’s also not an assumption. I’m speaking about MY feeling. Not his.
@goeljasper Again, what assumption did I make?
Going to Israel means you know what you’re talking about? That’s a bad argument, bro. How do you explain those who have gone to Israel and have a different opinion? And I suspect many (most?) in Ramallah would disagree with you. https://t.co/xrl2ifMfus
This. https://t.co/DBRcT6tSYI
@goeljasper What assumption did I make?
@ShaiBrill And your argument is “you don’t know what you’re talking about because... you don’t know what you’re talking about.” And your only evidence is that you don’t agree with me.
@ShaiBrill He didn’t “see for himself.” He was on an IDF tour. How is that open-minded? Would you say that if he went on a tour only with members of Fatah?
@ShaiBrill So you disagree with me so that means I don’t understand? That’s incredibly condescending and close-minded.
@ikambiz @palplusenglish Apples and oranges. I’ve worked with many athletes on justice issues. And many simply haven’t gotten access to the other side. Happened last year with the NFL.
@davidharsanyi @ProfMJCleveland Sure. I’m ready whenever you are.
@davidharsanyi @ProfMJCleveland So basically you just throw out ad hominems and call it debate. Got it.
@sixbravebulls @balzacforants @Money23Green Having critiques of Israel is one thing. But what you’re saying is anti-Semitic and disgusting. There’s no room for anti-Semitism in my position or among my allies. I’m not replacing one racism for another.
@davidharsanyi @ProfMJCleveland Right. Because everyone who disagrees with you is uninformed.

@goeljasper What blanket statement did I make?
@cosplaychussid No. I’m saying that our government is generally supportive of Israeli policy. This is reflected in our culture.  Israel doesn’t “control” us. I find that idea anti-Semitic and disturbing.
Statecraft refers to government policies and practices. ALL nations have statecraft. With regard to Israel, the US government has historically been supportive of such policies and practices. For this reason, we often normalize problematic State practices. https://t.co/AqEbZuoBaI
@TRich1914 They did! Lol
@sixbravebulls @Money23Green That’s not fair to Draymond. And feels anti-Semitic.
My experience is that many Americans, irrespective of profession or class, do not have a robust understanding of the “conflict.” As I said, it’s a function of the normalization of Israeli statecraft in our media and political education. It’s not a failure of individual citizens. https://t.co/q8kc3aDEEx
But we reached out to Michael. Offered him alternative info. I personally didn’t reach out to Draymond until he was already in the country. https://t.co/UEE5rGJOFO
Yes. Many. https://t.co/g3kk2WQtwT
I’d be curious to know what Steve Kerr would say about the Draymond’s Israel trip. Given his (and family’s) history on the subject, I’d imagine he’d have interesting insights.
Many athletes have agreed to such tours. And I think many Americans, not just athletes, don’t understand the dynamics at play. That’s a reflection of our media, schooling, and mainstream politics. It’s too simple to demonize them. https://t.co/YWMeX09kdv
It’s also important not to demonize Draymond Green for this. I disagree with his choice, but it’s our job to give him the necessary info. I’m confident that if he had been briefed, he would not have gone.
I really enjoyed @EdgeofSports’s piece on Draymond. And he’s right: it’s a contradiction to refuse a visit with Trump but to agree to one with the President of Israel. We cannot normalize either regime.

I don’t disagree in terms of talent. But “greatest laker” is different to me than best player. For example, wilt is a top 3 player ever. But his Laker legacy is not as strong as Magic. I put Kobe ahead of Shaq as a LAKER bc of longevity and titles. https://t.co/tiqAEgjmK4
@metroboominpass @xea76 Kareem is the greatest ever. That’s not in dispute. The term “greatest laker” means something else. Incidentally, I’d also take Shaq over Kobe.

@Spinozasrose This whole convo was about me rejecting a woman telling me not to read biased books, but to read Alan’s. That’s it. And somehow you’ve construed that as an anti Semitic posture. That’s mind boggling. So I’m gonna bow out.
@Spinozasrose 3) being an advocate for a position doesn’t make that position unfair —again, I don’t fetishized neutrality. 4) my reasonse wasn’t rejecting Alan’s book or its insights as such. Rather, i was rejecting the idea that’s its neutral.
@Spinozasrose 1) as ive said and written many times,  and as all my training has indicated, I don’t believe in such a position as “unbiased and neutral. 2) even if I did, someone like Alan, or ME for that matter, wouldn’t be one. We’re clearly advocates for a position.
@Spinozasrose Also, I never said the book was unfair.
@Spinozasrose Except I didn’t discredit the book. I rejected the idea that Dershowitz and his book are neutral and objective on this subject. I don’t even think Alan would disagree with this claim. I’m not neutral in my books either. It’s not an attack. It’s an epistemological claim.

@Spinozasrose I said that Alan Dershowitz isn’t neutral on the issue. You actually think that’s an anti Semitic statement? Yes or no.
@Spinozasrose No. It means that someone who identifies as an advocate for a cause shouldn’t be framed as neutral. Similarly, I wouldn’t call myself neutral for the same reason. Yet somehow you’ve made this obvious observation an example of anti-semitism.
@ScottRExley I read it.
@Spinozasrose No one said it’s in bad faith. I’m disagreeing that it’s neutral and objective. Dershowitz never claimed to be writing a dispassionate or neutral text. He’s taking a side, which is fine. Similarly, I wouldn’t call “The Case for Palestine” neutral either.

Second, studies show that Black children are criminalized and “adultified” by police in relation to their white counterparts. Here’s one empirical example: https://t.co/F7v3VrT5Qd https://t.co/62kIL9jvQ8
Both are true. White kids selling similar things don’t typically get the police called on them. More broadly, black people have the police called on them more than their white counterparts. Research proves this. Pointing to outliers doesn’t change that. https://t.co/62kIL9jvQ8

Every day, white children set up lemonade stands without a permit. These stands are a staple of the American cultural landscape. No one would even consider calling the police on them. The idea that they should interact with law enforcement is unfathomable.
The White Supremacist imagination denies the possibility of Black innocence, even in childhood. This is how police couldn’t even consider that Tamir Rice didn’t have a toy gun when they murdered him.
This is racist Mike. That is all. https://t.co/pbIrIa9nSR
If you call the police on an 8 year old Black child selling water, you’re saying that you don’t care if that child lives or dies. It’s that simple.

@russglewis What did I say to suggest that he should go to war?
What’s ironic is that Trump feels safe after one meeting with North Korea, which yielded no tangible victories or concessions, yet hates an Iran deal loaded with protections and clear signs of its effectiveness.

@MuneyJordan_ Word
The worst part is that we’ve just accepted the idea that the national anthem has to be sung before each game as an article of faith.
Standing in the locker room where no one can see you is not protest. It’s erasure. The players cannot accept this.
If the NFL players want to resist, they should ALL remain in the locker room during the anthem.
@beyontay I didn’t watch.
The new NFL policy is not a compromise. The players wanted to assert their right to peaceful protest. The league didn’t. The league has made it against the rules to do so. And no, staying in the locker room isn’t the same thing.
This new NFL policy on the National Anthem is ridiculous.

Palestinian oppression is predicated on several lies:	1) “these people have been fighting forever”	2) this is a religious disagreement	3) Palestinians keep turning down fair deals	4) Palestinians don’t want peace	5) if you’re critical of Israel, it’s inherently anti-Semitic.
Huh? I see black Palestinians all the time. Afro-Palestinians are all throughout the region. Hi @rulajebreal! https://t.co/4iF3Tbn0Sm

@howdy_clark Send me that quote
The battle over Jerusalem, of course, has a more religious character, as it involves holy lands for 3 religions. But that is absolutely not the same as saying that the conflict over Palestine, as such, is a religious one. https://t.co/q3Co2SkMK2
Palestinians have not appealed to the Quran to justify their argument. They’ve pointed to international law, tradition, and basic human rights. https://t.co/D5NCzzsJQQ
Early Zionist immigrants were largely secular, as were the Indigenous Palestinians. This was not a religious clash. https://t.co/D5NCzzsJQQ
I think that you know that framing the conflict as a religious one diverts the issue from one about land theft, settler-colonialism, and ethnic cleansing. It also invites people to dismiss it as an unresolvable squabble. https://t.co/D5NCzzsJQQ
@willcollier And yes, folk have made claims for Jerusalem on religious grounds. That isn’t what we were discussing. I’m saying that Palestinians’ argument for land rights is based on religious law, doctrine, etc.
@willcollier Go back and read the actual convo. I was talking about the religious NATURE of the conflict. Pointing to Hamas desire for an Islamic nation is actually moving the goal post.
@schlockDoctrine What feeling? I’m saying that choosing a side make it difficult to fairly or successfully do a deal. You disagree. Cool. That doesn’t make me cognitively dissonant.
@MicheleSchiesse Affirmative action
@willcollier I’ll let you in on a secret: Jerusalem is not the only place in Palestine.
@ajbarnett75 @TRiUMPh45 I didn’t say that. I’m saying religion isn’t the point of this conflict.
@percocetopenia By “they,” you only mean Hamas right?
@schlockDoctrine Nothing about yesterday’s move signals a desire to negotiate. Going against the international community doesn’t signify being a fair broker. It doesn’t bring people to the table.
@schlockDoctrine Your “fact” doesn’t contradict anything. You showed me trump saying he wants to negotiate. I’m saying I don’t believe him, and that his actions support my skepticism. It’s not cognitive dissonance. I just don’t agree.
@LahavHarkov Read my tweets.
@DedanBiko How do manage the numerous Africans in Israel, Afro-Palestinians, and African nations directly affected?
Hamas has absolutely made its religious aspirations clear. This isn’t in dispute. But desiring an Islamic nation is not the same as appealing to religion as the legitimizing source, as opposed to international law, convention, etc.
The Palestinian case for self-determination and freedom has not historically been made by appeals to Islamic law, scripture, or practice. And again, all Palestinians are not Muslim.
I’m getting hit with a ridiculous number of tweets about this so let me reiterate: the Palestine/Israel conflict is NOT a religious one. It never has been.
@davereaboi You’re arguing that Palestinians have historically argued for land rights based on religious grounds? Show me where.
@Abc11Ab That’s only partially correct.
@TRiUMPh45 1) our debate wasn’t about Hamas. It was about the origin of the conflict. And whether it was inherently religious. 2) yes, hamas’s charter is driven by religious principles. However, that’s not the same as making scripture-driven land claims.
@Abc11Ab I was talking about the negotiations. They first land partition offer was in 1937. Hamas was founded in 1987. This was what I was referencing. Again, you’re taking the conversation out of context.
@schlockDoctrine No. It’s not wrong. I’m making a claim that Trump’s actions betray his words. Showing me more of his words don’t change that.
@shlomikliab It’s also fascinating that you focus on Hamas, which has never been the negotiator for any deals in the history of the conflict.
@shlomikliab We’re not going to get anywhere. You’re not interested in an actual convo. Just proving how “ignorant” I am by talking beyond my point.
@shlomikliab You’re not listening to what I’m saying. Article 9 is a case for why Islam should be the foundation of a state. Not an argument for entitlement to the land.
@DedanBiko @shlomikliab Lol. I’m trained in this area, yes. Not sure what you mean by non-black issue.
@shlomikliab Also, when you read the Hamas documents, as you say you have, you see that they’re making religious claims for why they believe in nationhood, homeland, etc. Not religious claims as a proxy for actual juridical ones.
@shlomikliab Hamas is a religious organization with religious goals, but that is not the same as what we were discussing. Also, we were talking about the origins of the conflict, which precede Hamas by 5 decades.
@shlomikliab Go back and read the convo. I was disputing the argument that this is a “religious conflict.” It isn’t. The primary demands around borders, equal rights, and right of return are not religious arguments.
@shlomikliab Hamas absolutely wants to create a religious state. But that’s not its argument for WHY we should redraw borders, allow right of return, etc.
@shlomikliab Perhaps because you missed the context. My point is not that there aren’t religious arguments. But Palestinians aren’t appealing to Islamic tradition as the REASON why they should have a state.
@schlockDoctrine There are clear debates about the status of Jerusalem. The international community has chosen not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital as a means of resolving this. Also, trump and Netanyahu have claimed all of Jerusalem to be the capital.
@NoamOhana you totally missed my point. Abbas (nor the Palestinian Authority) has used religion as the basis for the Palestinian case. Taking a wrongly translated clip about the mosque doesn’t change that. Also, why the name calling?
Catch me in a few minutes on CNN for AC360. I’ll be debating Darrell Scott on Trump, Palestine, and more. Spoiler Alert: I win.

@MeyerLansky718 That doesn’t make it a fair deal. That just makes it better than more unfair deals. I ask again: was it a fair deal?
@MeyerLansky718 Explain how 47 was a fair offer.
You realize that other countries were considered as well, right? And they didn’t have Jerusalem. https://t.co/MCT3vSborQ
@BenR877 Ok. You win. I don’t know anything. I just google. I’m not trained in Middle East studies. I don’t work on these issue every day. You’re right. I’m wrong. سلام
@BenR877 I don’t dispute that 08 was a better offer than 2000. That doesn’t make it a sound offer.
@BenR877 You’re missing my point. Perhaps because you’re more interested in ad hominems than actual debates.
@BenR877 Also, the “Status Quo” of international (largely Jordanian) control has been problematic for decades.
@BenR877 No. I’m disagreeing with your analysis. By all accounts, Olmert was asking to keep settlements in Jerusalem. Show me an account that says otherwise.
@BenR877 And repeated unnuanced talking points isn’t debating the conflict. To say they rejected every offer without looking at the context of the offers —or ignoring Zionist rejection of offers— is either wrong or dishonest.
@BenR877 If you’d look at your TL instead of insulting me, you’d see I answered your question already. Within seconds.
@BenR877 But there’s no point in discussing. You begin by saying I don’t know anything. There’s no respect for my side, though I’ve been civil and fair. Enjoy your day. Peace.
@BenR877 It didn’t allow for sufficient contiguous potable land. And the status of Jerusalem was a non-starter. Same in Clinton accords. The Peale and UN partitions were uneven. Again, all offers aren’t good offers.
@BenR877 Or I’m a scholar of the Middle East. And I have an informed opinion based on research and work in the country. You?
@mattw5947 Fundamentally, no. Religion is certainly entangled. But the Palestinian position has not been about religious rights. The status of Jerusalem is connected to religion, but it’s not the core issue.
@BenR877 When did they not, except MAYBE 2000? And that’s far more complicated.
@MeyerLansky718 That’s a great talking point but offers no context.
@hboogie1221 I said “issue.” But that’s not true either way. And early Zionists moved in the late 19th century. There has been conflict since late ottoman times. Land conflict has happened since the British mandate, which was absolutely before the mid 20th century.
@BenR877 Palestinians weren’t uninterested in deals. They were uninterested in unjust deals. You’re saying that because they didn’t take the deal, they must not have wanted one.

@Real__Ari So why did you say I didn’t have understanding/experience? What was the basis of this statement?
@RQA @MarkHorowitz No. I said that the waves of immigrants were largely from Europe. He asked about Arab and Africans. I said they came later. These are facts. If you disagree, show me.
@MarkHorowitz I’m not denying their influence. I’m making a factual historical statement about when they arrive.
@RQA @MarkHorowitz How did you get that from I wrote?
@craigrandolph70 This is silly. I’ve publicly critiqued Hamas many times before. I just did again.
@craigrandolph70 I don’t agree with Hamas. I disagree with their shift toward islamicism. I disagree with their homophobia. I disagree with their sexism. I disagree with their anti-Semitism. I’ve said it many times before.
@MarkHorowitz Right. I was referencing the shift that happened from first Aliyah to the interwar period. Most black/brown immigration came post-48.
@StopBDS_PSFC @eight20two You’re not confused. You disagree with my usage of the term. But it’s not confusing. I’m referencing citizens of Israel. Just like you are. You just don’t want me to call them Palestinian. That’s your choice. But let’s be honest.
@craigrandolph70 Again, where have I written an article critical Netanyahu? Israel? PA? Egypt? It’s dishonest to say I haven’t written about hamas, as if I’ve been disproportionate
@MarkHorowitz @MarkRubello You realize they weren’t coming en masse during the time period I referenced, right?
@Real__Ari Do I not understand or do you simply disagree with me? What have I said that demonstrates a lack of understanding?
We were discussing the West Bank. Hamas doesn’t control the West Bank. Also, there is a blockade of a Gaza since the 2006 elections. I’m very critical of Hamas, but they don’t exist in a vacuum. https://t.co/Um5V6SbBM7
@StopBDS_PSFC @eight20two Full rights? That’s simply untrue.
All nations are “made up.” That’s a pointless and ahistorical analysis. Also, Sykes-Picot was 1916. It was a secret colonial land grab deal that had nothing to do with legitimizing Arab states. https://t.co/ZUBLMa6dAt
@StopBDS_PSFC @eight20two And I specifically said Palestinian citizens in regard to netanyahu’s leadership. I was talking about people living the state of Israel.
@StopBDS_PSFC @eight20two You never responded to my actual claim, which doesn’t actually require the particular clarification you requested. But ok...
@RQA I stated a fact. If I’m incorrect, show me. When was Israel founded?
@vjr97 @dadcapps So you don’t believe in mandate or ottoman Palestine? You don’t believe that Palestine has records? Or leadership? Or history?
@craigrandolph70 Also, have I written a vicious condemnation of any of the parties? If so, show me where.

@damnelace Nope.
@grapeckel @SecondContArmy Actually I was a fierce Obama critique. Google.
@SecondContArmy Show me where liberals celebrated him for it.
@MarkRubello You do realize that the bulk of immigrants, those who shifted the land’s character, came in the 20th century, right? And they came from Europe...
Almost no nation recognizes Jerusalem as its capital. It’s contested space. This is why Trump’s move is so provocative. https://t.co/TZznjwY2sU
By moving the embassy, and subsequently endorsing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Donald Trump is sending a clear message that he has no interest in creating a two-state solution. Like Netanyahu, this has always been the case anyway.
Moving the American embassy completely undermines America’s ability to present itself as a fair broker in the Middle East, but specifically around Israel/Palestine.
@MarkRubello You think that only Jewish people lived in Jerusalem?
@SecondContArmy How is this relevant? If Obama had said the opposite, would you then feel differently? Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy.
@MarkRubello You said Israel. You cannot just swap words and say they mean the same thing. I dispute the point either way. But you certainly cannot say a 70 year old nation-state has existed for 3000 years and then call me obtuse.
Israel was founded in 1948. But otherwise, that’s a totally accurate and cogent argument. https://t.co/PzHKhxwqcc

@MeyerLansky718 I know this poll. You’re not giving an honest read. It says 47% support two states. There was no mention of peace. You’re defining peace as two states, which is nowhere near the same thing.

This summer will be crucial for the Sixers. Simmons and Fultz must continue to develop their shooting. A big time two-way free agent is needed on the perimeter. The Atlantic Division is an arms race.

At the beginning of the season, I predicted 45 wins a a first round win. Once we got here, though, I thought we'd win the series. This is tough.
This was a series of inches. The sixers were outplayed and outcoached at key moments. But I'm very proud of where we ended up.

The Sixers took the lead by working the paint and slowing the game down. We lost it with quick(bad) shots and poor transition defense.
@TimBehrentClark they weren't the ones shooting them.
@TimBehrentClark No. I'm not blaming the officials. I'm saying the Sixers committed too many dumb fouls.
This may be moment where Brown just has to take Simmons out. His offensive shortcomings are a liability at this moment.
We are bailing Boston out by settling for low percentage shots.
At some point, Sixers need to get Embiid in the paint and make him attack Horford. Especially since he has 4 fouls.
Run a play!
Now would be an awesome time to put our best player, on both ends, back into the game.
The Sixers being in the penalty with 10 minutes left is absurd.

@JRH_97309 i'm saying that's his appeal to the average Joe. The fact that people can see themselves in him bc he's not freakishly tall or athletic. He's an elite athlete, obviously. But no compared to his peers.
@TearChugger if you're saying that everybody in the NBA is athletic, then sure. He's athletic. But if we're comparing him to his peers, he's not. I'd say the same for Magic Johnson or Carmelo Anthony. Amazing players. But athletic wouldn't be how i'd describe them.
@TearChugger so after i name then, then what? you say they didn't really say it and it goes on. The fact it, TJ isn't considered an athletic player. This is why PROFESSIONAL scouts said that he isn't.
@JRH_97309 You think his passing and shooting and coordination are better than the average nba pg?
@22thesnowman Which is why I’m comparing to his peers, and not the rest of us.
@TearChugger Guess you didn’t read the scouting reports.
@wpaul67 And I think that’s ridiculous. The debate was about how coaches relate to star players. Charles can’t be right because he didn’t win? What if two players with rings disagree?

Yes. The presentation was near and organized. But it didn’t provide new info, nor did it prove (or even suggest) that Iran was violating the deal. In fact, even Israeli And US have acknowledged that Iran IS following the deal. https://t.co/Awirp2Xklr

@handymayhem I don’t understand the question.
He’s right. And that’s something I rarely say about President Obama and the Middle East. https://t.co/WIOSlGJEY3
There is simply no credible evidence that Iran is moving toward nuclear capacity, or that the current deal isn’t working. Does Iran fund proxy wars? Yes. But backing out of this deal doesn’t make that less likely.
Donald Trump’s decision to back out of the Iran deal is indefensible and dangerous.  It not only increases the chances of nuclear proliferation, but also further isolates the US.

@owenfonline because it's predicted on counterfactuals. For example,if we had a conversation about what year Puerto Rico became a country, it would be an inaccurate one.
There has NEVER been a moment in history when Black people didn't resist slavery. Some did it by jumping off ships. Some killed masters. Some ran away. Some did it through everyday forms of resistance. Slave masters didn't retire. Our resistance led to our freedom.
This whole "slavery was/wasn't a choice" conversation isn't just problematic because it's inaccurate. It's also extremely reductive. There's more options than "remain a slave" or "die."
