There is a BLACK character in the movie #BlackPanther named ‘Man-Ape.’ Man-Ape is the leader of the Gorilla tribe. The gorilla tribe is played by all BLACKS.		Every liberal that is calling for @therealroseanne’s head LOVED &amp; RAVED about Black Panther.		Stop the selective outrage.
What I find fascinating is that WHITE social justice warriors are the ones freaking out the most about @therealroseanne’s comments.		White SJW’s are quick to defend black Americans because they don’t think Blacks are capable of defending themselves.		I think that’s pretty racist.
People on the left call @realDonaldTrump a racist every day. I disagree 100%. 		When you call everyone you disagree with a racist and can provide zero examples of that person ACTUALLY being a racist, the term racist loses it’s value.
