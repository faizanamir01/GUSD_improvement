@mitchellvii Unfortunately FB is a huge part of the swamp. The only way they can feel pain is from a loss in market share. If there revenue goes down so does the swamps revenue. Congress won’t do anything
@jcpenni7maga @RealMAGASteve @fbsecurity @fbanalytics @fbOpenSource @tedcruz @DiamondandSilk @OrrinHatch @LindenLab @SecondLife @rodvik These Social Media companies spend years seeking ways to gather data and get a price for it. This is second nature for them. It’s very sad and I hope Congress has the ⚾️⚾️ to litigate. They won’t though because they coat there pockets with that same cash😢
@GrizzleMeister @tedcruz I was lucky and that’s about all I saw. @tedcruz owned him for sure. I can’t believe he took the description of “community” to be the Silicon Valley area! Facebook is Worldwide. Not as sharpe as everyone makes him out to be😀

It appears in the press that USPS would be bankrupt without the Americans who pay taxes. It’s pretty obvious Amazon is not making USPS profitable. Beside the point as no Government program is but Amazon has been able to take advantage of this Government service. https://t.co/CqXyEpjbI5
