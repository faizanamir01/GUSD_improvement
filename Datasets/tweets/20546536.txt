"We all grieve for Cindy and the family, they will continue to be in our prayers. And lastly, I do believe that is what Timothy had in mind when he wrote, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” So we say, thank you @SenJohnMcCain."
"We all have our John McCain story—a time when we were moved by his stubbornness, his courage, or his passion –sometimes all three at the same time. I look forward to hearing these stories and tributes from my good friends."
"John served his country faithfully for 60 years. We owe him a great debt for that service. This week we will mourn him. We will honor him. And we will celebrate the truly remarkable life of an American hero."
"He was a patriot and always faithful. We all know that patriotism and loyalty to your country isn’t based on your words. You have to live it. And of course, @SenJohnMcCain did that every day."
@JimInhofe @SenJohnMcCain "... I know and anybody else who served with him [knows] that he was always for the underdog, always for the troops out in the field... He would always take care of the Soldier, the Sailor, the Airman, the Marine."
@JimInhofe @SenJohnMcCain "...he was a fighter and never shied away from a good fight. He was passionate for the causes that he believed in, a strong advocate for human rights and democratic values—standing up for oppressed people around the world."
@JimInhofe @SenJohnMcCain "And then you always have heroes that you deal with and we are dealing with a hero when we deal with Sen. McCain...I think Timothy, when he wrote 2 Timothy 4:7 had John McCain in mind when he said 'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.'"

The science behind climate change is #uncertain, but the cost of the president’s regulations is not.

Inhofe: It’s not clear how the President's short-term tactic to “simultaneously pressure ISIL” fits into a larger strategy that can succeed.

Inhofe: What does #KeystoneXL mean for jobs?  It means #creating 432K jobs, &amp; that’s based on a conservative estimate.
Inhofe: Under Obama, oil production on private, state land is up 61%; natgas 33%. But, on fed land oil is down 6%, natgas is down 28%
Inhofe: We’re going through a shale revolution. The only thing getting in the way is the federal gov’t. #KeystoneXL
Inhofe: The #KeystoneXL, which Tom Steyer wants to stop, would create 42K jobs &amp; more would be supported in the manufacturing sector.

Inhofe: It was so bad, that the govt recently repealed the carbon tax, and their economy is now the better for it.  #australia
Inhofe: Australia imposed a carbon tax on their economy a few years ago. It caused $9 billion in lost economic activity per year.
Inhofe: The selling pt of the Democracy Alliance’s pitch to its donors is its deep connections w/in the White House.
Inhofe: In April this group convened a meeting in Chicago to huddle w/ its deep pocketed donors to craft strategy for this yr’s elections.
Inhofe: WashPo published a chart detailing all liberal orgs being coordinated for the democratic political agenda by the Democracy Alliance.
Inhofe: We spent all of last week debating a const'l amendment to limit political speech that is currently protected under the 1st Amndmnt.
Inhofe: And I think this is an appropriate time to talk about the hypocrisy on the left over political spending.
Inhofe: It was reported that Steyer's only been able to secure $1.7M from outside donors so far.
Inhofe: Explains why it has been difficult for Tom Steyer to raise the full $100M he promised to help Democrats win elections this fall.
Inhofe: No one wants anything to do with GHG regs when cost is so high. Probably why recent polls put GW at the bottom of voters priorities
Inhofe: Reputable studies on the #capandtrade bills show the costs always amounted to $300B-$400B in lost per year.
Inhofe: Since Pres. Obama failed to achieve his signature cap-and-trade leg, he has been working tirelessly to regulate GHG w/o Congress

Inhofe: Unlike what the President seems to believe you can’t slash our defense budget and expect our military to do it all.
Inhofe: With regards to ISIL, tough talk that isn’t backed by meaningful action
Inhofe: I was hoping to debate these important issues with #NDAA but we can’t even bring NDAA to the floor
Inhofe: We still don’t have answers to questions such as: What does Iraq look like at the end of these operations? #weneedanswers
Inhofe: We still don't have answers to questions such as: What does a defeated or destroyed ISIL look like? #weneedanswers
Inhofe: We should ask the pilots dropping bombs over Iraq whether they think they are in “combat”
Inhofe: The Obama Administration is sending the wrong message to our #troops, to the #enemy, and to #partners.
Inhofe: We already have boots on the ground in Irbil and in Baghdad and throughout Iraq.
Inhofe: The President's claim of “no boots on the ground” is an insult to the men and women in Iraq today who are serving in harm’s way.
Inhofe: There was a collective sigh of relief at ISIL Headquarters in Raqqa, Syria, when they heard the President’s #strategy
Inhofe: The President’s strategy to defeat ISIL is fundamentally #detached from the reality on the ground.
Inhofe: We still don’t have answers to questions such as: How do we prevent strengthening Assad when U.S. airpower weakens ISIL in Syria?
Inhofe: I believe it’s critically important we establish today how ISIL is fundamentally different from Al Qaeda
Inhofe: ISIL has reportedly 35,000 fighters. It’s estimated that at least 2,000 fighters hold Western passports and ~100 are U.S. citizens.
Inhofe: The President again #failed to acknowledge the seriousness of the threat ISIL poses to U.S. national security and to the homeland.
Inhofe: Airstrikes can only be fully #effective when paired with the skills of a trained air controller on the ground.

Inhofe: So if the oil doesn’t come to the United States, Canada will just send it to China.  Sorry Tom Steyer, you can’t win on this one.
Inhofe: The Canadians have already had conversations w/China ab building a pipeline to Canada’s Pacific coast so they can ship oil to Canada
Inhofe: #KeystoneXL needs 2be built. We know ab the jobs, bt more importantly there's not a single good reason why it shouldn't be approved
Inhofe: "Keeping this from happening would be the real impact of imposing anti-energy global warming policies"
Inhofe: This means the spending on these new pipelines alone will create 432,000 direct jobs, and that’s based on a conservative estimate
Inhofe: "#KeystoneXL would create 42K jobs &amp; tens of thousands more would be supported in manufacturing sector"
Inhofe: "But the truth of the matter is enacting #globalwarming regs will cost the nation $300-$400B per yr in lost economic activity"
Inhofe: "In Feb., Steyer revealed he was planning 2spend $100 mil to make #globalwarming a national issue again"
Inhofe: The portion between Canada &amp; Cushing, however, remains stalled, and at this point I think the only reason is billionaire Tom Steyer.
Inhofe: "It was a separate project that did not require presidential approval because it did not cross an international border" #KeystoneXL
Inhofe: "The Southern leg of the pipeline may be finished, but that was the part of the project the President didn’t have any say in."
