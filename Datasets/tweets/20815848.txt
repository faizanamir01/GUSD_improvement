@BobLogIV Very unlucky. Hey, tippet without injuries might have been an amazing player.	Luck is a huge factor. So i'll happily concede that. 	Agreed with Naismith over Nank as well.	But if we didn't have Tippett on the books, we might have kept both.	And had the $$ for titch.
@BobLogIV Yeah, he ended up being a decent ruckman. Fair call. 		So we then trade out Nankervis... for him to get injured again and Nank to be the engine to roll the tigers to a premiership.		And half a season of decent ruck play... was that really worth the huge salary cap hit?
@BobLogIV It's true... you're right.	He's a polarising figure.	Can't be too harsh because he's been injury prone.	But he's been a HUGE cap hit for the production. Esp during the COLA reduction period.	I can't really recall any games he's won off his boot.
@BobLogIV spell

@RalphyHeraldSun The @AFL is missing the point of the head high contact rule. To protect the head.	If the umps see any player (esp a selwood) FORCE a high contact to the head they should be penalised for it.

@mcdonellaussie @stevenjamesmid1 @RalphyHeraldSun Maybe your missus punched you in the face in the middle of the night?🤔😂
@aflratingsPete I didn't actually watch a single JLT game and started my team properly about a week ago.
@WarnieDT looked like the ball could have been kicked out of the hand. Not enough evidence on the tv to overturn so just left it to the umps decision.		I rather that. #AFLDonsCrows
That was a great decision.	Not enough proof to overturn. Leave it to the field umpires.	#AFLDonsCrows

@jadomai91 @superfooty I hope not :(	Bump's are always a risk. Merrett was NOT prepared for that, didn't see it coming going for the ball.	Burden of safety is in the tackler's responsibility.
@BeefaBeyer06 Yeah, that's what it looks like. But he's spitting blood. Mouth split. Failed concussion protocol. Seems like it his head was hit somehow from the collision.	Maybe the vid just doesn't show the impact.	Pharmacy friends telling me there spotting bruising on the cheek as well. https://t.co/OqEirxErk7
@superfooty Blood in the mouth.	Split lip	Failed concussion protocol.	Richie might be gone for a few weeks choosing to hit.
@TheLadfromAus And he's now gone.	Concussed.	#AFLDonsCrows
@stevenjamesmid1 @RalphyHeraldSun Spat out blood. 	Pretty good indication he's been hit in the head.	Also now out of the game.
@healyhp Ok, blood in the mouth from the hit... pretty good indication it did hit his head.	Vid doesn't look like his head was hit though.
@BeefaBeyer06 Ok, blood in the mouth from the hit... pretty good indication it did hit his head.
@TheLadfromAus Punishment against the victim is huge with one player less.
@BeefaBeyer06 That was a solid hit though. I don't blame him for being down for a while.	At least he didn't get stretchered off like in soccer 😂
@TheLadfromAus I'd say yes.	Even if it happens 10 mins later.
@BeefaBeyer06 Yeah, take that back. That was a good hit! 😂	Lucky merret turned :)
Ump needs to pull merrett OFF the field. NOW!	He's concussed!	And the bloke that hit him... should get a red card and be sent off too.	#AFLDonsCrows
This ain't the NFL where a no one knows what a catch is...	That was a bloody mark!	#AFLDonsCrows
