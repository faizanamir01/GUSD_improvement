+125k jobs have been moved overseas bc of sugar's high prices. Depression-era subsidy programs that cost billions must end to keep US jobs
Americans will spend ~$2.2 bil on candy this #Halloween, but did you know US sugar policy will cost taxpayers $115 mil over next 10 years?

The U.S. &amp; the international community need to directly impact #Russia's financial power – stronger financial &amp; energy sanctions are a must.
POTUS needs to designate #Ukraine a major non-NATO ally like Israel, Australia, Japan, etc. so we can support w/ direct military assistance.
It is worrisome that POTUS is unwilling to label #Russia's recent actions as what they really are: an invasion of Eastern #Ukraine.
#Ukraine is still asking for the U.S. to designate it a major non-NATO ally—it’s long overdue that we listen. https://t.co/RZyNSmvJDd
Will #Russia's 1k troop invasion of #Ukraine be enough for the US to financially isolate Russia or are we waiting for a complete takeover?
