Today, 75 years later, the story of Tony and the 10 Americans is being remembered. The @royalairforce alongside the @usairforce completed a fly past to honour their sacrifice and Tony’s dedication. #RememberTheTen https://t.co/ffzuEB9zAl
In 1969 a plaque was built for the 10 Americans that gave their lives for the young Britons. For decades Tony has visited it. He lays his hand on the memorial as he talks about small things. His plans for the day, the weather. He never stopped trying to keep their memories alive.
Pilot Kriegshauser made a choice. Instead of risking the lives of Tony &amp; the other children, he steered the plane into the trees just beyond the park as the last engine failed. The plane crashed. There were no survivors. But Tony would never forget that moment as long as he lived
There were 10 Americans aboard the B-17 Flying Fortress “Mi Amigo”. Sputtering, the plane was returning from a harrowing WWII mission over Berlin when an engine failed. 23 year old Pilot Kriegshauser steered the B-17 to a park to crash land. It was then that he saw the children.
In Sheffield 1944, 8 year old Tony Foulds &amp; his friends were playing outside when they heard a loud roar. Tony looked up to see a plane so low he could see the pilot waving at him. Tony waved back. It was only later he would realise the pilot was trying to get him out of the way. https://t.co/k1ZNtrqEx0

Arguably its most distinctive feature, the F-35’s engine can swivel 90° to enable vertical landings. Watch a British pilot make history by making the first shipborne rolling vertical landing on @HMSQnlz last month.		Learn more about vertical landings: https://t.co/hxpkxKNMGP https://t.co/n1IjMtxHyR
The F-35 is known for its stealth, but it also has the ability to switch into “beast mode” increasing its carrying capacity for longer flights. https://t.co/ybaOtW28ic
X-Ray vision is no longer just for comic books! The helmets worn by F-35 pilots stream real-time feeds from 6 infrared cameras around the aircraft.		This allows them to “look through” the airframe, providing unprecedented situational awareness in the sky. https://t.co/cgdS0ikS4Z
The F-35 has 8 million lines of code - more than was used to launch the space shuttle.		All of this goes into ensuring the F-35’s operating software, avionics, sensors, displays and communications systems are the best in the world. https://t.co/6Ym4zL3wkl
This week, the UK announced it is set to double its number of F-35 stealth jets after ordering 17 more.		But what makes the F-35 Lightning II the most advanced fighter jet in the sky? 	 	Take a look under the hood to find out ⬇️ https://t.co/hXEBswtdXo

Denial of the right to FoRB is a growing problem internationally, either through the actions of states, or through their inaction in the face of social persecution and discrimination by non-state actors.

Whilst the local authorities prioritise rescue/recovery efforts, you should   consider whether to travel to, or within, the affected areas for the duration of Hurricane Michael. You should follow all State or Federally issued advice over the coming days.
For up-to-date information, follow:		@FLSERT	@GeorgiaEMA	@AlabamaEMA	@SCEMD	@FEMA	@NHC_Atlantic 	@NWS
A state of emergency has been declared in FL, AL, southern &amp; central GA &amp; across SC.		You should monitor weather updates from @NHC_Atlantic and follow the advice of local authorities, including any evacuation or ‘shelter in place’ orders.
Life-threatening storm surges &amp; very dangerous winds are expected along the coast and hurricane-force winds will be felt far inland, including parts of  Georgia and Alabama. Heavy rainfall is likely to cause inland flash flooding. Tornadoes are also possible.

More information about The Duchess's Coat of Arms: https://t.co/nTrAhSozrI
Her Royal Highness worked closely with the College of Arms throughout the design process to create a Coat of Arms that was both personal and  representative.
The three quills represent communication and the power of words. Beneath the shield on the grass sits a collection of golden poppies, California's state flower, and wintersweet, which grows at Kensington Palace.
The blue background of the shield represents the Pacific Ocean off the  California coast, while the two golden rays across the shield are symbolic of the sunshine of The Duchess's home state.

Read more from PM May on how the UK will make the gender pay gap a thing of the past: https://t.co/lhBFb6RisN
Nearly 9 out of 10 who are out of work in the UK because of caring duties are women. To provide training, help update skills and enable people to return to work with confidence, the UK gov has made $7million available for returner schemes.
The UK contributed 100+ hours of negotiation to agree conclusions @UN_CSW on empowerment of rural women and girls. First time in over a decade that consensus was achieved. #CSW62
Last month, the UK gov announced a $2.1 million fund to help tackle the gender pay gap.
Action is already being taken: 3 years ago today, the UK introduced shared parental leave.
The gender pay gap in the UK is at a historic low but progress in shrinking it remains far too slow. PM May: "equality for women is a right, and our whole society is the poorer as long as it remains unrealised."
As of yesterday UK businesses with 250+ employees must disclose pay data to calculate the #GenderPayGap. This transparency is just one step to ensuring gender equality in the UK. https://t.co/n0mC9uMvvZ
