@CosbyWild @kcuse23 @Cyn7507 @GeorgiaLady7 @DHSgov @POTUS @FCC Now who's shoving it down the throat?
@CosbyWild @kcuse23 @Cyn7507 @GeorgiaLady7 @DHSgov @POTUS @FCC 7 backgrounds... What more needed?	The Dems said no to any name Trump spoke before mid terms...

@CosbyWild @kcuse23 @Cyn7507 @GeorgiaLady7 @DHSgov @POTUS @FCC That's why they need to finish making the new immigration laws!		This is what the Repubs have been calling for.

@rebeccacfreed @marioella1 @NCEmergency @realDonaldTrump He is the President of this Country and my Commander in Chief.

@AKelticgirl2 @Erikajakins @votevets Sounds like the Dem party won't lift a finger to do one positive thing for this Country if it will make Trump or Repubs look good. Shameful that their hatred of this president has allowed them to forget their obligations to the people. They want America to fail for a win in Nov.
