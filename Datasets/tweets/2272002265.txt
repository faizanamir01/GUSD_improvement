@DamagedBttm be wary of the oil. see if you can retin a or the generic brand (works just as well). and def start a vitamin c serum in the morning. it's expensive, but a small bottle lasts for like 6 months. (don't get it on amazon; they often water down the formula)  https://t.co/Jp3XeFlTZ7
@DamagedBttm Start with a retinoid cream asap. Retin A is fantastic. You need a prescription for this. After you've been doing that for a month, visit your Derm again, and they can do extractions if necessary. Also, start a vitamin c serum daily. skinceuticals makes a great one.

His temperament and partisan language during this “tacked-on” hearing were appropriate for someone interviewing for a lifetime appointment.
@KFerrugia @kilomikealpha76 @ChrisRBarron What do you think of as “impartial media”. Personally, I do not think genuine impartial media exists.

@ShaunDEllis1981 There have been more than 3 accusers at this point...
@kilomikealpha76 @ChrisRBarron Dr. Ford did not make that accusation. But yes, the stakes are very high. It’s an important job with a *lifetime* appointment. So the stakes are always high. And the decisions he would be faced with on the Court are high stakes. It’s clear he cannot handle high stakes.

@ShaunDEllis1981 I completely understand that. You would have every right to be pissed. I happen to believe her. But that's not my point. You can be pissed, but you're not up for Supreme Court Justice. He can be pissed, but he is up for the job. Today, he showed he can't handle the pressure.
#BlaseyFord #KavanaughConfirmation #KavanaghHearing #Kavanaugh #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
He is qualified w/ respect to his education/job experience. But doesn't his performance today, at the VERY least (even if you don't believe Dr. Ford), cast doubt on his character? On his ability to perform under pressure? On his ability to respect others as they do their jobs?
He is here to convince a committee of elected officials that he is credible and that he is capable of being a Supreme Court Justice. After watching his temper flare multiple times, how could anyone argue that he is capable? I am not arguing that he is unqualified. /4
Also, the Republicans kept saying how we need to treat each of those testifying today equally. While I agree they should be treated equally, shouldn't Kavanaugh be held to a MUCH higher standard? Dr. Ford is not seeking a job. He is. She is here to tell her story. /3
She wanted it to be confidential. But it wasn't. Yet she rose to the occasion and told her story. Kavanaugh came in yelling and crying. He was rude to the people whose JOBS are to assess his credibility. /2
Another thing (clearly I've been rewatching segments of the #KavanaghHearing), Kavanaugh kept citing how Blasey Ford wanted it to be confidential and how the Dems didn't honor that. Yet here she was today, never yelling, never crying, never being rude to her questioners. /1
Many don't. In fact, even before she testified, they said they didn't. https://t.co/2OETZU6D5d
Also, what's the point of putting all the letters into the record? Will senators even read the ones that aren't consistent with their intended votes?
I get he apologized. But again, how you act under pressure, demonstrates your character. #KavanaughHearings
The @SenAmyKlobuchar interaction is so telling of how Kavanaugh thinks about women. The condescending tone he uses to question her is repugnant. But more importantly, it's not how one conducts one's self in a job interview.
@jpa_jpa_jpa Ask Amar
The fact that Republicans were willing to speak with Kavanaugh and not Ford is its own brand of insidious sexism.

If Ford had cried, I'm sure there'd be people on the Right calling her overly-emotional. But here's Kavanaugh crying because he may not get the job he doesn't deserve.
Kavanaugh: "What goes around comes around"		Also Kavanaugh: "it is our job to make [the witness’s] pattern of revolting behavior clear—piece by painful piece."		So at least he's right about something.
He seemed angriest about "fights on boats in Rhode Island."

@Taniel @NateSilver538 I didn't read it as her belittling Ford, but I felt like she undermined herself and her professionalism. If she felt this was such a terrible format, why did she agree to do it in the first place? Her good judgment is clearly lacking.

"Do you mind if I say something to you directly?" She had to ask the man who is supposed to be judging her credibility if she could ask to speak to him directly. THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS!
We should pray for a day when we don't have to keep citing statistics about what sexual assault survivors undergo post assault. We should pray for a day when we believe survivors and fight alongside them to dismantle the patriarchal structures that support the assailants.
Politicians love the sound of their own voices. Each has 5 minutes and most have spent more time speaking than listening.
"The uproarious laughter" "The multiple attempts to escape" "The final ability to do so"
It's been said. But it bears repeating over and over until it comes to fruition: SUBPOENA MARK JUDGE!
What's the science behind polygraph tests? Genuinely curious. Are they considered very reliable in a court of law? I know this isn't a court of law. But worth asking.
Despite having to relive this trauma in front of the nation, Dr. Ford is still pulling out the scientific receipts to explain to everyone how memory and trauma work. It's incredibly powerful and a testament to her character and brilliance.
Grassley getting super defensive is not a good look.
The prosecutors' decision to participate in this manner demonstrates her lack of sound judgment.
Dr. Ford's testimony is more powerful than any political grandstanding by both parties. Let her speak!

@PaulaHyland @mattwilstein @jimmyfallon @realDonaldTrump Never did I say Jimmy Fallon was the sole cause for Trump winning. Nor did he really have a major effect, if any. The point I am making is that Fallon humanized Trump on his nightly talk show. He didn't have to do that. He chose to do that. And it was the wrong, cowardly choice.
@PaulaHyland @mattwilstein @jimmyfallon @realDonaldTrump There are many factors that led to his winning the Electoral College. To deny Fallon had any part in humanizing Trump is quite careless. Of course Fallon did, and he did it willingly because Trump's policies do not really threaten a straight, white dude.

Blaming sexual harassment on women is no different from blaming death on people in the Twin Towers on 9/11. 	"They worked in a tall tower in one of America's largest cities. They were asking for it."	If you blame the terrorists, then you must blame the men. End of story. Done.

The fight didn't end on Election Day. That's' when it BEGAN. Hollywood needs to do better. Actors need to be braver. Resistance cannot rest
Spicer disgusts me. The actors at the #Emmys who did NOTHING while he spoke disgust me even more. They can no longer claim to be allies.
@JuddLegum I'm even more disappointed in the hundreds of influential actors who just sat there and gasped/laughed.
@michaelianblack I'm even more disappointed in the hundreds of influential actors who just sat there and gasped/laughed.
This was a disgusting display of those with power refusing to join the Resistance.
...literally sat there and laughed. Spicer is responsible for helping push Trump's racist, sexist, homophobic, and Islamophobic agenda.
I'm just so disappointed in these actors I look up to. Students at Notre Dame walked out when Pence gave a speech. Yet Hollywood elite...
I bet Fallon jacked off to the normalization of Sean Spicer. #EMMYS
@AaronBlake And the fact that not 1 actor got up&amp;left in protest is even sadder. They sell liberalism, but when push comes to shove, they sit back&amp;laugh
Actors have a voice. Anyone with an ounce of courage would've walked out in protest at the sight of such a despicable and dangerous liar https://t.co/Cb35nYFkM6

@MrErikJackson @washingtonpost So we shouldn't criticize artists and ask more of them in these dark times? LMK how that goes for you
@cerzej @HillaryClinton https://t.co/EGUqrp1Y0J
@RheaButcher Maybe not. I was just disappointed by Gaga not making an overt statement in the face of a man who supports conversion therapy
@MrErikJackson @washingtonpost Explain why it's smart to be subtle in this time of fear? Hint: it's not
@RheaButcher No. because there was nothing shocking about it. It wasn't a statement. It was barely a performance tbh
@hisillusion you're right. She didn't. She chose not to. Do with that what you will
@jonnymangs singing a billboard hit is barely a political statement. See @Beyonce for how to make a strong statement at the #SuperBowl

Me: Use lube. You'll need it.	Me to me: Spit will be enough...	#GayAgenda https://t.co/Mw66XRXO8G
Him: I'm a banker	Me: https://t.co/KkMYyQY4CF
My gay wet dream: @britneyspears and Frank Ocean collab on a "Fuck the #GRAMMYs" single
@dinhi45 @realDonaldTrump @iamsambee @StephenAtHome @sethmeyers @Trevornoah yes. Yes. Yes. And no. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@GrisLuivindy @YouTube Noah didn't even get close to the boundary https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@angryblackhoemo @Trevornoah @wusa9 He failed everyone with half a brain https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@deray @DavidDTSS @Medium nobody should be happy with this feeble excuse of an interview https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@crissles true! I just wished he seized the moment more https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@6ame @Trevornoah https://t.co/qhkGD2BEqu
@mashable @Trevornoah It wasn't a very good lesson https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@voxdotcom Agree to disagree https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@TomiLahren here are my #FinalThoughts https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
.@nbcsnl is not the press. https://t.co/XETK9M44k0
We are disgusted at the thought of Dr. @RealBenCarson as our next Secretary of the US Dept. of Housing and Urban development https://t.co/NRHI5jwPGy
@ChloeAngyal https://t.co/2fMxyFT5sr
@StephenOssola @TeenageCloseted Edit: Taylor Swift's talent
.@jk_rowling will be re-writing "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" with Umbridge's character replaced by Trump in 2017. Enjoy! https://t.co/Hp6aIBVmIz
Friend just said to me: I left my earring at this random guy's place. So now I have go sex with him again to get it back. (the sex sucked)
@TomiLahren sure. BS. Sure. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
The Donald Trump just dropped any pretense of knowing what he's doing. Just a Trump scam to raise fear! https://t.co/ipqFw1WS6K
@CBCNews @liamstack He can defend it all he wants. He still failed. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
Just tried watching you run the country - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and your cabinet appointments just can't get any worse. Sad https://t.co/DgS5Q7Tc5k
@PureRockFury @HuffPostPol @HuffPostBlog My take on the interview: https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@vulture https://t.co/qhkGD2BEqu
@rudolfvanwyk @YesImRight1 Speaking more loudly does not translate to victory https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@AmandaMarcotte I was not a fan https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@treknray @thedailybeast @Medium letting the stupid rant is a dangerous practice #Trump
@TinaLaBang that's a hot take I so agree with https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@faaaadumo https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
Is @TOMFORD a top? Asking for a friend...
@GIFChaseH I'm drunk and don't understand this reference

@jonlovett https://t.co/VhvBw3Wb5m
@officialhotrod @TomiLahren @Trevornoah America should deserve better https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@spookiibitch21 offensive about being smarter
@spookiibitch21 engaging in respectful discussion does not mean refusing to attack flawed logic and point out stupidity. There's nothing
@SeamusM01 @Medium also @TomiLahren never yelled during the interview
@SeamusM01 @Medium that's not what the article is saying at all.
@SeamusM01 see the following for a legit argument https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW 😘
@SeamusM01 honey, this isn't a policy debate.
@iviwengudule Trevor Noah 👎🏻 https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@cayliam I wish there was roasting. At best, he lit a flimsy match https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@vividly_vibrant @Trevornoah @BostonGlobe it was a dreadful interview https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ibmont it's not great https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@RealDerekSherry @Trevornoah agreed. But let's move forward to someone with talent https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@djeterg19 @tumblr no such destruction occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SeamusM01 @1059KISS @wordpressdotcom @Medium did he though? What was it? That we should respect such illogical thought patterns?
@whvsper @Kingwole he could've specifically pointed out the many flaws in her logic. Instead he lightly poked fun. We should expect more
@JenniferGBiehn @TomiLahren @Trevornoah oh honey please. He didn't disrespect her beliefs at all. That's the problem https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@kc_jr cause let's be honest, nobody's crushing on his mind https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Rehan__Babar a real sad excuse of a @TheDailyShow host https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@spookiibitch21 Why? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@akateach1 @chelseahandler @Trevornoah @K_JeanPierre @ChrisCuomo and Noah must go from "The Daily Show" https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SLM420LOVE no such obliteration occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SeamusM01 @Trevornoah @YouTube He didn't. And it won't. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@1059KISS @wordpressdotcom did you watch the interview? He absolutely held back https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@whvsper @Kingwole a hater of Noah and his unwillingness to call out and confront bullshit when he hears it https://t.co/GRc8xhQURc
@yngpdwn agreed https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@jessicasusan28 @TheAffinityMag really? A favorite? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@yellowshark I don't drink beer. Causes bloat
@whvsper @Kingwole Clinton
@Coffeegenius https://t.co/ne2jmmDOB9
@hellofromgabby @DaniTheAvenger2 @TheAffinityMag @TheDailyShow why? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@DAME_LAVIE https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@aliyalangley @ComedyCentral This interviewer...weak https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@WitheredGhost Yes. Yes. No. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CBoyd_07 @TheAffinityMag if he's a God, then I'm an atheist https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@torraays @alessiasrocket no he didn't. If anything, he helped her become even more visible to the American public https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@yellowshark more like the drama tea https://t.co/CBx7jMCgjU
@cwc2k1 @Trevornoah @benshapiro so let's recast Noah https://t.co/qhkGD2BEqu
@Amandashow_95 and untalented https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@baylo15 @Trevornoah it confirmed my distaste for both of them https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Flyswatter @TheAtlantic what he found was a weak and uninspiring voice https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@pressvue @RT_com What voice?! https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@whvsper @Kingwole he had 1 good joke man. That's all. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@GiselleUgarte @TomiLahren @Trevornoah interesting points. Here are my #FinalThoughts https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@AlyssaFields00 @Trevornoah @ComedyCentral please point to the greatness. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Warpspeedx3 @PrisonPlanet https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Coffeegenius https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Marleyblossoms @TheAffinityMag it wasn't worth it https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@yellowshark I'm like REALLY gay https://t.co/P3sVyOVNtZ
@MsLeaLlovet @Trevornoah @Medium cute? Yes. Funny? Nah. Smart? Yes. Good "Daily Show Host" no way
@gripmagonline @Trevornoah @TomiLahren no he didn't https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Mr_Blodgett2 @Trevornoah he was erased from mine https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@raven_nicoleee it's not worth it https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Z1079 @wordpressdotcom yes he did. A ton. And that's why he's failing https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CENARULES4EVER @Trevornoah @TomiLahren @TheDailyShow @YouTube someone call casting! Noah failed again https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@HarmonicaHound @williamcson agreed https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@efairhurst @BostonGlobe and the resulting interview is rather sad https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@OneNewsPage_US no such grilling occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Salon if that was "all in," he's got a lot of work to do https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@AarSee @TomiLahren @Trevornoah she didn't. But that doesn't excuse Noah's weak interview https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@irenexplores no we don't https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@LiaMadeline @Trevornoah you can do better https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@KaylaRiley24 @ajplus @TomiLahren @Trevornoah @Medium https://t.co/CiKcohS0Ur
@naarmis except he didn't shut her down. I agree with out he used her own words. But he had the chance to show up wth facts/objective logic
@AnnaJoan94 @Trevornoah @TheAffinityMag I'll take that bet https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@AnnaJoan94 @Trevornoah @TheAffinityMag
@S_FultonUnited spoiler: no such obliteration occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@sarajanenyc @Trevornoah why? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ericsfaison @Trevornoah @TheAtlantic fire? More like a flickering flame about to go out https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@MsLeaLlovet @Trevornoah you can do better https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@naarmis he barely called her out https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@gretagarbled @TheAtlantic and sadly, it's a weak, unfunny voice https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Globetoppers but why not take her to task? Liberals need to take their voices back. Plus he's a comedian and his best joke was a stoplight
@BuzzFeedNews he didn't face off. He basically did little more than listen and lightly poke holes in her thinking https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@mglagola14 @Trevornoah @BuzzFeedNews does he really deserve that much respect? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SamWould_ @YouTube the nail was right in front of him, and he missed https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@RalstonReports @BostonGlobe My take on the interview: https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@KaylaRiley24 @ajplus @TomiLahren @Trevornoah really? Your fav? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ThylacineReport he could've really challenged her instead of making lackluster jokes
@laur_kls @zacheese1 how much? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@MJStarLover I wish he had roasted her. He barely lit a match https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CKarinC @Trevornoah @TomiLahren @blackvoices yes to not supporting Tomi. But no high-gives to Noah https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ThylacineReport did he even do that though? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@Globetoppers @chelseahandler @Trevornoah https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@treknray @thedailybeast taking her on feels way too strong. He barely did that https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@yellowshark gay so not too into Moms
@_africanprodigy https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@yellowshark @Trevornoah I have to disagree https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@allyraelyon https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@ll_CDahly13 nobody knows how https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@mullen_maddy @keithboykin but he didn't. And that's the problem. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@jasmineeeea fine looking? Sure. Fine interviewer? Not in the least. https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@DonMcKenzie @ComedyCentral my take on the interview: https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@RICHORNUTTIN @Trevornoah https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CavanBradyMusic maybe he needed to lose it https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@TheTEEDGE @TomiLahren @ComedyCentral it's easy when @Trevornoah gives you a free pass
@BoxMan_MK2 @TomiLahren @Trevornoah this dialogue was uninformative and largely built on a lack of facts https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@MamaFlo_ love is such a peculiar thing https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@MamaFlo_ he's using a pretty wimpy grill https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@suzanne_barillo he feels barely woke at best https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@asteingruebl @djsziff playing it fast and loose with the word "humorous" https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@MeganSpeck https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@_DLini @Medium https://t.co/2U5KTG8xD0

@ItWasJustDanter what number is that exactly? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@SC_Author did he? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@emilyhommel @ComedyCentral he must be climbing a miniature staircase   https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@shamirajamess @OMGkee https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@skyeobie except he didn't
@joeyesposito @YouTube the defining moment was one of failure, not success https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW

@ctheadcase fellow Connor, I am way more than a bit trash 🗑
@CaseyGoldstein no he's not. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't speak up. She asked what the KKK did. Sometimes, you gotta teach
@MobSquadDF https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@LucasGugenheim but was she destroyed? https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@CaseyGoldstein I agree he created a conversation. Except, I'd say he made very few points when he had a chance to.
@CaseyGoldstein did he speak up though? He barely poked holes. Use intellect for speaking true facts. Where's the DA when we need it?!
@yrwrong https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
@JoeRGannascoli @NYDailyNews no grilling occurred https://t.co/qhkGD2k3yW
