@now_pain @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump Again with the name. Former Communist East Germany was officially “Deutsche Demokratische Republik”.

@babaoriley4321 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump No. The NAZIs, in their time, rounded up and shot Socialists and Communists.

@MoWin16 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump For the umpteenth time... Yes and former Communist East Germany was officially “Deutsche Demokratische Republik”.

@DeborahLynn333 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump Yes.

Within a year of Pearl Harbor we were fighting and winning a war on two major fronts.  No thanks to isolationists...
@LoveLig66141315 @1776Stonewall @realDonaldTrump So, by your rational, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (AKA North Korea) must certainly be a ‘democratic republic’, eh? The NAZIs used the term “socialists” but certainly were not socialists...

@0Tamahawk3 @CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Jeff, my contention -one has nothing to do with the other. Just a typical WHATABOUTISM distraction. Trump’s bias in Judge picks has NOTHING to do with the number of black players on NFL rosters. Actually a majority of black players on the field doesn’t even disprove NFL bias.
@0Tamahawk3 @CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Actually, I never brought up the NFL or NBA or CBA or USFL or any other sports leagues. Someone else led us down that deflection rabbit hole. My contention Trump is racially biased in his Judge picks and his behavior demonstrates this stands...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Ha! Not stumbling on your silly math. Now your arguing all positions should be filled according to racial quotas. Ok. White males=25-30% of the population so we only need 2 or 3 on the SCOTUS. Let’s make everything equal by your math...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Ok I get it. Minorities and women aren’t ‘rushing’ to fill these positions. So that is why only white males need apply. “Silent racism”?
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN So now you’re arguing whites dominate coaching in a sport dominated by black players? We’ve already determined that fact...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN The number is closer to 70% - don’t exaggerate. But the number of players on rosters is a tiny part of the NFL. Blacks and other minorities are grossly underrepresented in coaching, management, lower and upper office positions across the NFL. Can’t use the NFL to make your point.
@CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN The left or right has nothing to do with Trump’s racism. You do know he lost federal housing discrimination lawsuits in the 70s right? It isn’t the left making this shit up...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Haha! You really wanna bring up the NFL to make a point about racism? The number of black players doesn’t prove the point you think you’re making. Seriously?
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN You are clearly delusional. Trump has made 90% white mostly male judge picks. All but 6 SCOTUS Justices in US history are/were white men. Clearly we pick judges based on color...
@CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN FYI The Donald has demonstrated his nativist, racist qualities in many other ways than just his judge picks. This is just another in a long line of clues dude...
@CWNBCIA @0Tamahawk3 @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Huh? “Native in his blood”? WTF does that even mean? Native what? Person of color - what? Your condescension and minimizing tone comes across as whitesplaining. Who can tell your ethnicity or demographic from your Avi?
@goodoldcatchy @bgsharpy  https://t.co/A1dMOzsSqw
@CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN No the simple answer is not “no”. Racist acts don’t require specific intent. Trump has nominated no black judge and a scant few other minorities. He’s selected 90% white mostly male judges which implies he’s operating under a specific bias. Intentional or not...
@0Tamahawk3 @CWNBCIA @fearandbalanced @watspn1013 @MagaKirk @CNN Did we just get racism whitesplained? And yes we don’t know for sure The Donald based his decision on race - he certainly did not say so. But 90% white judge picks? His actions kinda speak a little louder than his words...
@HedrickTanvi @Catdame @MarkDice @realDonaldTrump Dice makes a false equivalence. Trump mocked a reporter, specifically imitating his disability, to degrade, insult him for his crowd.

@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 To change the subject, what’s up with the “Cupcake” thing? I’m so confused when I get chewed out and then referred to by the name of a sweet pastry... https://t.co/y5q6RSILSM
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 We’re well beyond accusations Dubya. Meritless accusations don’t get Special Counsel appointments. Phony accusations don’t result in plea deals. The BIGGEST THREAT OUR COUNTRY FACES is willful ignorant  mass delusion wrapped in bold arrogant confidence.
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Who’s dangerous? Which one of us was threatening a “civil war”? Grow up Skippy..,
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Every single planet inhabited by sentient beings except for Planet Hannity. It was investigated and concluded...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Jeez dude. I know you wanna be taken seriously but then you go and post up crap from this source? No wonder you are a bit touched in the head... https://t.co/Qfmoyj5TSG
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Oh boo hoo for Caputo. Who told him to hitch his wagon to the most dishonest, amoral, corrupt, conniving shyster to run for president in over a century?
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Who absolved Hillary? FBI determined not enough evidence to pursue charges - it happens all the time. Think Comey closing, reopening, closing the investigation days before the election helped Hillary? Now you just have wait for evidence on DJT. It's coming. Patience...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Yea, yea, yea "ZERO" evidence...more wishful thinking.
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Yea, yea, yea...witch hunt. Wishful thinking. https://t.co/sosqpDGmkU
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Clearly you and Trump don’t know how the law works. Collusion is like that little white speck on top of chickenshit. It and everything underlying are chickenshit. Monicagate started as Whitewater years before. Mueller was wide legal leeway. Sorry ‘bout that...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Ha! https://t.co/xz75n5YzRE
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Says the guy yammering about conspiracy theories...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 WTF are you talking about? Honestly in the minds of Trumpkins Hillary won the election. Forget Hillary. She’s gone. Done. She can’t hurt you anymore. She can’t save Trump from his own doings. Focus on now...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Occam's razor: When presented with competing hypothetical answers to a problem, one should select the one that makes the fewest assumptions. Live it. Learn it. Know it... https://t.co/zaV2AVzoRi
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 If no evidence then no investigation. No special counsel. No Congressional investigations. If there were no crimes then you'd have no worries. Evidence is there. Wait for the deal to play out. Quit squawking: "Nothing BASED IN EVIDENCE". It's there. You can't wish it away...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Hannity is an idiot. People who follow him are delusional. Go find some real news.. https://t.co/OI50pVIV6G
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Integrity? The GOP DOJ and Special Atty looking into allegations of collusion and obstruction and who knows what else and you think it should be overlooked, ignored because you're still stuck in a Clinton fantasy. Ignoring crimes for political reasons is no sign of integrity...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Comey made no determinations. His words were: "As a result, although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this, we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case." The DOJ chose not to pursue. Sorry you don't approve...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Comey did not "close" the case. He referred it to the DOJ without recommendation of charges. First Lynch, then Yates' then Sessions' DOJs decided not to pursue charges. Sorry you don't agree with their determinations. We can rely on their expertise...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Ok Sean Hannity. Whatever you say. Your news is authentic. Anything you disagree with is fake news. Whatever you say Mark Levin...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 The investigations have been concluded. Sent to the DOJ and charges not pursued. HRC deal is done. Gone. She's at home in Chappaqua resting with her grandkids. Sorry it didn't work out to your satisfaction. Now lets move on to the NOW...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 HRC investigations are concluded, closed. Things are proceeding in chronological order...as you wish.
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 How precious! The Donald lies more than any other President in modern history. How many lies has he told just today alone? Amazing...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 3 email chains contained markings indicating possible classified materials when they were sent. Of 10s of 1000s others found on the servers approx. 2000 were classified "after" sent. This shit is all well documented. Sorry the molehill doesn't add up to a mountain for you...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Dude we got the truth. Just because you don't like the truth doesn't mean you get to invent a different "truth"...
@realDonaldTrump As if you the @realDonaldTrump reads... https://t.co/whPKuPWs6k
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Only in your mind a "two-tiered" system. Wishing to avoid investigations of DJT crimes because you disagree with the conclusions of multiple and thorough investigations of HRC. There are no "baseless accusations" because "baseless" doesn't gather warrants and plea deals...
@Hoosier84 @DUBYA_BLOCKED @steph93065 But that won’t stop Trumpkins from deflecting any questions of The Donald to “WHATABOUT HER EMAILS”!
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Who is convicting “via accusation”? There is an actual ongoing investigation. You wish to ignore allegations of serious offenses because you fear what they may reveal. That’s not respect for the rule of law. That’s silliness...
@RealJoshPugh @MarkDice Of course you do... https://t.co/XbZwmV4D4X
@MarkDice Yea right. You don’t like free speech. It makes you weepy... https://t.co/9WSLzlz3sz
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Holy Moly! 30, 000 sealed indictments! Is this the Trumpf Putsch? Will he be rounding up all his opponents?
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Only the most ardent Trumpkins can see all the evidence of shenanigans all around and pretend nothing exists. It’s a very deep and impressive delusion...

@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 No evidence that’s been revealed as of yet. Unless you’re part of the investigation and privy to inside info. In which case you might be violating some laws...😎
@Hoosier84 @DUBYA_BLOCKED @steph93065 Obama tried to institute Shania Law!...😜
@Hoosier84 @DUBYA_BLOCKED @steph93065 Ditto! When Trump starts strutting around in a Mussolini outfit it might be cause for concern...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Impeachment is a legal Constitutional process. I’m pretty sure civil Wars are unconstitutional. I’m no Jeff Sessions or anything so I could be wrong...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Ha! There is only reality. Not yours or mine just reality. Only news confirming your bias will enter your working brain...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Fair enough. Just checking...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 @DUBYA_BLOCKED do “you”, “we”, “us”’etc. and whomever else you keep referring to collectively ever get accused of exhibiting patterns conducive to a political bot? Just curious...
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Dubya, the investigation is ongoing. We don't and won't know until it is completed. Trump trying to stop it, muddle it, confuse it, is only making things worse.
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Beside the dribbling rants of Hannity and Trump what intel or evidence supports your denials? You do know the dossier has not actually yet been proven fake. There is also evidence of shenanigans in the form of guilty pleas and pending court action on dozens of people.
@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Yea...Flynn has already plead guilty. No luck needed. What remains to be seen is what Flynn has to reveal before everything is over and done. I don't need a helmet. However, you will need some Depends® though...

@DUBYA_BLOCKED @Hoosier84 @steph93065 Yea Dubya...  21 indictments, 2 guilty pleas, 100s of charges, investigations widening - no Mueller proof? Keep deluding yourself...
@JefferyEBullock Ha! But three rights do make a left!
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec Example...when folks call minorities Uncle Toms because they don’t fit in someone else’s view of how minorities should think or act politically. This is a common racial use of the term.
@JefferyEBullock Dummy is right. Me continually bashing my head against a brick wall of ignorance. My bad indeed...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec Ohmygosh dude! It’s not racist because she wasn’t making a derisive comment based on SHS’s race. Wolf  was making a comment on Sander’s working for DJT who (Wolf perceives) acts against the interests of women. It wasn’t very funny but it also wasn’t racist...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec When folks call other folks Uncle Toms based on a misrepresentation on a feature or attribute of their race then it’s racist. Is this example clear?
@JefferyEBullock Jeez who’s actually playing the victim Jeffery? Allow me to again repost your Tweet which drew reasonable response. Are you not offering a joke based on her skin-tone? Am I reading it wrong? Jokes on skin color are by definition ‘racial’. Other folks here agree with me... https://t.co/Gm0305AuTF
@JefferyEBullock Ha! Cute Mexico meme. And for your info after I posted the victim card meme I removed it promptly. However, in all fairness you threw down the victim accusations at me first...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec Jeffrey, I told you the context - Michelle Wolf didn’t use Uncle Tom in a racial context. You don’t agree. So be it. As for as hominem attacks? Seriously I just reposted the words ‘you’ used...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf @PressSec Jeffrey, you asked for context. Sorry if you find it offensive. No projection going on...
@4YrsToday @JWillette1805 Do I get some Trump steaks?...🤪
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf Jeffery, @michelleisawolf didn’t direct the Uncle T term on @PressSec as an insult directed at a feature of SHS’s ‘race’ - Not racial context. Unlike your joke about Michelle - is she an AA or a tanning bed user? Which is about skin tone, racial. Sorry to break it to you dude.
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf Uncle Tom is problematic but not necessarily racist. Just depends...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf Hole up there skippy - Who started with the race thing? Here’s a reminder... https://t.co/LC4d3DCA7e
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf Jeez Jeffery my grands moved here over 100 years ago so don’t have much first hand Mexico info. I could ask some of my cousins who still live there? But I really think you’re just tossing a little bigoted jab at me and not really interested. I’m from Texas what country you from?
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf Oh brother Jeffery poor you! 😢 You have no white race or ethnic based group. Boo hoo! You have only the entire historical foundational power structure and everything is soooo unfair to you...Sniff, sniff.😢
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf Ha! “Our” culture?!? Where do you think I’m from Narnia or Wakanda? The term “Uncle Tom” is racist depending on the context and the speaker and the target. It is not racist because you wish it to be...
@JefferyEBullock @DennisDMZ @michelleisawolf While I’d say the Uncle Tom comment wasn’t very funny, it still wasn’t racist...If the shoe fits.
@1776Stonewall @JefferyEBullock Dude, it’s Cesar Chavez saying... https://t.co/ZscD1MN9Af

@CharlesThor75 @Thomas15Z @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity It’s no secret.

@gttbotl So you’re saying the former Klan leader David Duke didn’t used to be a Democrat but is now a Republican? Or that there wasn’t a party switch? Both are historical facts ... regardless what you or I ‘understand’.

@ToxicExplodley @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity In his early 20s Byrd was in the KKK and lived another 80 years regretting it. What does this have to do with Hillary? In 1927, Daddy Fred Trump was arrested for brawling with KKK guys against the cops - We don’t hold that against little Donald do we?
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity You’re overlooking the fact that 2016 is only the 2nd time in modern history a President is elected who didn’t capture the majority of votes. Of course all these voter suppression/correction things, however we perceive it, are gonna get looked at...
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity I’m a minority. I have an ID. That’s not the only issue. Closing down local DMVs, moving them far away from central areas, inconvenient hours of operation, little things adding up to unnecessary burdens for some folks. Not everyone drives cars. Other forms of ID should suffice..
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity Yes purging is useful for removing dead and those who’ve left the area. However, in many of these key states 10s of 1000s of living, active voters were removed arbitrarily. And you’re right voter purges aren’t necessarily nefarious ... until they are.😉
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity Also thanks for the discussion. It’s nice when we can chat with folks without getting too unfriendly!...😜
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity True enough...
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity Purging, ID laws are suppression when targeting minorities (you know -race) and young voters. For example, in Wisconsin alone 200K voters were either purged or otherwise kept from voting. DJT won the election by only 78K votes in MI, PE, and WI - 200K less votes changes things.
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity As for GOP voter suppression efforts look up interstate cross check, voter roll purges, onerous Voter ID policies, gerrymandering, etc. Shit! There was even a recent effort by NH Republicans to bring back poll taxes! Not making this stuff up... https://t.co/X6d2zJ3035
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity See...you’re defending civil war statues just like the Democrats who placed them there somewhat more recently than the Civil War. Their placement was more about upholding Jim Crow than “preserving history”. The monuments belong in graveyards, battle sites, and museums...
@Catalyst_317 @2runtherace @RealCandaceO @drawandstrike @seanhannity How does that contradict the fact Southern Dems switched to Republicans after the Civil Rights Act Passage? Do you see Democrats today weeping over the removal of Civil War monuments? Do you see Dems pushing voter suppression and race policies today the Switch happened...

@silenceisnotawk @Vancecat1 @vm_marshmellow @GrammieJean @steph93065 @ChristiChat Yes illegals can’t vote, get Social Security, eligibility for welfare, etc. Deportation is legal for removing illegal immigrants. They’re still held to the law. But they still have the basic freedoms and due process. Illegals still get treated according to same law everyone else.
@silenceisnotawk @Vancecat1 @vm_marshmellow @GrammieJean @steph93065 @ChristiChat Over the past 200 years SCOTUS has ruled time and again that anyone ‘physically’ in the country has constitutional rights. One isn’t denied “due process” or other basic freedoms for overstaying a visa or sneaking across the border. Still subject to the law but with basic rights.

@Vancecat1 @silenceisnotawk @vm_marshmellow @GrammieJean @steph93065 @ChristiChat The source of that figure, the FAIR immigration study, has been widely debunked.
