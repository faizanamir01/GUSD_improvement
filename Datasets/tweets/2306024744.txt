@undakii @effie_mama @baelabree @PabloSexibar when we say "shop" we mean going to pet stores. I'm not against humane breeders
@cokedoubt first off i think any source i give you that says anything that supports what i'm saying you will consider biased but the humane society of the United states has a lot to say about puppy mills. also a fact sheet by them: https://t.co/dQoZ5oKPHD
@cokedoubt but most puppy stores buy from puppy mills. if the breeder is humane and you do your research before buying from them, there is no problem :^)

@hann_bannnn @effie_mama @baelabree @PabloSexibar its not that they think you are supporting them, giving them money is supporting them whether you like it or not.
@effie_mama @hann_bannnn @baelabree @PabloSexibar when you buy the puppy mill dogs,,, you are supporting the people who are in the puppy mill industry. you are creating a demand for more puppies from puppy mills. do yoy understand basic economics
@freckledgrl333 i'm about to join you in the ginger club

@hologramvin i feel like otherkin would more accurately describe it than furry tho, right? not all furries identify as an animal, for some people being a furry is like being a part of a fandom amd their fursona is not actually how they perceive themselves.

@yourcatlikemem1 @dejager_ryan @YIPEE_USA @MiaKind1914 people can be born with a single x or y chromosome or multiples of both! intersex people exist, and then there are also xx females and xy males. there is a spectrum in biological sex (^:
@yourcatlikemem1 @dejager_ryan @YIPEE_USA @MiaKind1914 sex is less of a spectrum, but gender is a spectrum.
@zeno001 @Skepticat_UK @MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA toxic masculinity and cis gender men, yeah. we'll never agree tho bc you dont think trans women are women, you think theyre men
@Lastovich1 i dont think feminists are man haters, i consider myself a feminist. that means i fight for women, i fight for trans women, i fight for trans men, i fight for men and i fight for nonbinary people. everyone has been harmed by the patriarchy and toxic masculinity.
@MiaKind1914 @Skepticat_UK @YIPEE_USA @zeno001 I understand that those examples are awful, but those people do not represent all of the other trans people who don't do that shit.
@zeno001 @Skepticat_UK @MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA i hate the patriarchy too, but the problem is cis men, not other opressed groups. trans women are not fake females, they are females who were not born in the proper body. the only apology i'll make is for  not properly articulating my statement the first time, i corrected myself.
@robjessel ~aesthetic~
@Skepticat_UK well trans women arent men so ?
hey apparently i hate women because i belive that cis women are not the only people who should be protected under feminism
@Skepticat_UK @MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA @zeno001 only hate ive had is towards trans exclusionary radical feminists and thats because y'all are contributing to the opressive rhetoric that gets my trans friends hurt
@Huttoneer they dont EVEN have the support of all of those, deborah
@cinderfknreIIa girl i understand women are opressed, but you have also become an opressor of the trans/gender noncomforming community. you're not a liberator, you're part of the problem.
@Skepticat_UK @MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA @zeno001 that IS transphobia. how can you say that is isn't? you are denying the existence of trans women.
@Skepticat_UK @MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA @zeno001 okay, okay so maybe you dont hate men, but you dislike the patriarchy and use that as excuse to misgender and spout hate against trans women, who you see as men. so you're still spouting hate against people who, in your eyes, are men. and you just have A LOT of trans hate on.
@cinderfknreIIa you're just using feminism as a blanket to hide your transphobia, honey,  if anyone here is being pathetic its you.
@cinderfknreIIa they call themselves nonbinary, and if they feel more comfortable there and are not hurting anyone, what is the issue. going into a mens dressing room could elicit more violence against them for not conforming. the enemy is toxic masulinity, not trans an enby people
@Skepticat_UK @MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA does your transphobia not stem from your hate of men? because according to a lot of the shit i've been reading on your tl thats what it seems like
@cinderfknreIIa sorry i dont read transphobe trash and get my info from acredited scholarly textbooks
@cinderfknreIIa you saw a person in a skirt and called it a womans costume, YOU, in doing that applied a binary
@MiaKind1914 @YIPEE_USA hi my name is mia and i think i know better than doctors and psychologists because i hate men

@cinderfknreIIa also based off of all of the psych books ive read, and my anthropology courses, gender is a spectrum
@cinderfknreIIa well considering you see a nonbinary person in a skirt, you say its a woman's costume. i'd say you associate a skirt with femininity, gender is just a product of society and while you're against a patriarchal society,  your response show that you're still participating in it

my grandpa told me i wouldn't live comfortably if i made under 100,000 dollars a year. i told him that wasn't feasible for my chosen profession (teacher) and that many americans makes much less than 100,000 dollars a year. he could not fathom that i was okay making less than that

Also a little break to just showcase us at prom together. We wore the colors of our oc's blood (not going to disclose the fandom but if you know it don't judge us) and went as moirails. She was, I think, my platonic soulmate. &lt;&gt; https://t.co/3HrwNRS3Vi
She always supported me by coming to my shows, my water polo games, and my swim meets. When she joined theatre her senior year, she expected to just be a part of Set Dec. but she faced her fears, overcame her shyness and became an actress her senior year. I'm so proud &lt;3 https://t.co/9j2t5T4Ak2

I mean, really. We're huge dorks. I have much more evidence and proof of this to come. But LOOK AT HER, SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! A lot of pictures you might see of her, she's smiling all pretty and nice- but let me tell you she is the QUEEN of funny faces. https://t.co/BhbMoovFC5
We were dorks for sure, but I don't think I could have asked for a better best friend. We would sit in a room and communicate solely through weird noises and gestures, out of all my friends, she was always the one I felt most comfortable with. She was my sister. https://t.co/3EyoTIZWrV
Everyone knows she was an amazing artist, I was inspired by her- she literally taught me everything I know. We went through phases together, binged cartoons, made up really bad oc's, cosplayed- everything. All of the art I've made, I made because she got me interested in it. https://t.co/ZdkCztSBJc

i wonder if the person grading my essay actually read it, or if they saw it had nothing to do with econ and trashed it. who knows, it will forever be a mystery. i ended up getting a 2. 		moral of the story: um study i guess even if you're too sad to?
i kept writing and writing until the time was up and my friends were looking at me like "damn she had a lot to say about [whatever the essay question was about i literally have no clue]" but in reality i was just writing shit to write shit
i wrote down like a three page essay about my life, my family, where i come from and how my experiences have shaped me, what i wanted to do in life (bc now it's not the same i realized i can never be a politician and be happy)
i thought my bs was going pretty well until one of the essay questions. one i got down really well, but i had no idea about any of the other ones, so instead of giving up then and there and looking sus...
so when the test came around I was kind of prepared for gov (I got a 3, so not really) and then the econ test came and whoo darn i literally had no knowledge of anything aside from "buying bonds equals big bucks"
so i was going through a really rough time in high school so i hardly paid any attention in class (i'm so sorry @whalen4pres2020)  and gov was okay but ECON yikes, that had math

@n_klootwyk @LordChamber1418 @cat_balloo @donnawm sure, i can agree on that, but for me personally, i'll be teaching high schoolers, and while i will not bring up nonbinary identification up (unless need be), i will be discussing the evolution of gender roles in society and regional differences in gender expectations.

@n_klootwyk @cat_balloo @donnawm @LordChamber1418 Yes, but it varies by region. The definitions of masculinity and femininity are not the same in every country. And I will be teaching English- and if any of my students identify outside of the gender binary, I will be teaching acceptance.

Educate through understanding + respect
@n_klootwyk @donnawm @cat_balloo @LordChamber1418 Teachers are humans and I think letting your students know what you believe in is fine as long as you're not forcing them to believe in the same thing. I won't discriminate against a student with different beliefs from mine, but if their beliefs = harrassment of another student..

@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline Local funding of schools is not fair for all students (your kids included), and is the main reason why they don't receive the education they deserve. The problem isn't undocumented students, it's the lack of priority the gov. has for our children
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline A lot of ESL classes are separate from English speaking classes. If they aren't, then it's because a lack of funding to that school. So many schools are under funded, ex. Arizona spends approx. $7,489 per student, while New York spends $21,206 (2015 averages)
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline If you're gonna be mad at undocumented citizens, I totally get it, but be mad at criminals first, maybe even be mad at the parents who brought their kids here,  but not the students, not the kids.
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline I agree that homeless and veterans (especially homeless veterans) deserve our priorities as well. Lives shouldn't be a trade off though,  we need to find ways to assist everyone.
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline They don't get federal scholarships, and are ineligible for FAFSAS every scholarship they get is through a third party. Some states offer scholarships, but not all- so little to no taxpayer money is helping them go to school. They get there through hard work and dedication

@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline They had to have been under 16 when they were brought to this country, they may be that age now, but when they were brought here, they weren't.  Under DACA they are being productive members of our country. They're just as American as I am as far as I can see.
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline So your kids are the only kids that matter? American kids are the only kids that matter? I'm tired of this America First BS- we are all humans first, your lack of empathy for your species puzzles me.
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline I've lived in California my entire life,  nothing wrong with ESL, it helps these children learn English- would you rather them not know how? And can you tell me, aside from healthcare, what other benefits they get ABOVE citizens? I think that might just be BS rhetoric
@carlechambers @KgdlBrown97 @MailOnline DACA students were brought here without choice, the only place tbey know is america. They are law abiding, either honorably discharged  from the military or attending school. DREAMers receive no special treatment aside from deferred action.  It costs nearly 500 dollars to apply.
@KgdlBrown97 @carlechambers @MailOnline I'm talking about DREAMers on the DACA program,  learn a bit about it
@carlechambers @KgdlBrown97 @MailOnline Well first of all, they're undocumented citizens on the DACA program, so learn what that is and it will answer your question. Also, try and ease up on the whole "alien" terminology,  they're people, human beings who just want a good life for their families.
@mommyinaz @kevinbarron_ @BetsyDeVosED You know nothing about Common Core, before you get into the discussion about education, please educate yourself
RT @kevinbarron_: Even my special edu students know a fraud when they see one  @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/ALQO50BqKq
@kevinbarron_ @mommyinaz @BetsyDeVosED Exactly. People need to read the common core standards, because they're reasonable and help prepare students to think critically and engage with content. All of the cases where common core has upset the public either stems from a bad teacher or bad implementation.
@SurvivorRules @BetsyDeVosED A big reason why hospitals are so expensive is because big industry pharmaceutical companies, not overpaid doctors. They studied hard and paid a lot of money to learn how to save and improve lives.
@KgdlBrown97 @MailOnline These people weren't on DACA and neither was the child in the car? What do you have against DREAMers who pay into the DACA and SS (even tho they can't access it) and contribute to society while not taking any federal funding to get their education?
@neenerbuzz99 @BetsyDeVosED Or make those schools better?
@mommyinaz @BetsyDeVosED Do you know what common core is tho
RT @sjeanboyd: @BetsyDeVosED Giving choice does not give equal access.
@BetsyDeVosED You also forget that the freedom of school choice is based on mostly on a families ability to send a child to a school outside of their district,  where a lot of low income families don't have that freedom
@BetsyDeVosED We should also focus on funding all public schools better and on teacher retention so that kids won't have to "choose" a better school, all schools will be equipped to teach every student

@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols If you honestly think that, you'd be surprised at how many people are have prejudice toward trans people, POC, gay people, or literally anyone that isn't straight, hetero and white. "Good people" can be bigots, it's not just in the south
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols And that's why we have the electoral college. That's why we have two houses of Congress. It's so states with large populations like California can't undermine the votes of people in different areas because they have less population. The electoral college is more reflective
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols It has to do with transphobia and I'm not gonna say all transphobes are cis, but like 99% are
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols They're in the minority tho. If the good ones were the majority, we wouldn't be having all the issues we have now
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols But when you look at how the electoral college voted, they didn't deviate from how their district voted?
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Some cis people implies that it hardly happens, when a lot of cis people actually say stuff like this
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Both maybe be wrong, but one is harmful the other is not
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I disagree. People's votes DO matter. People just need to vote. Elections are sometimes lost by as little as 50 votes in local elections (which are the most important) the lack of political efficacy in this country is what got us in this mess.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I am cis and I'm not offended bc the whole point is they're not talking about all cis people, just the ones who say shit like that
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I don't have an issue with it. I'm just saying it's a black and white concept with little gray area. Real life is more complex
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I agree with you on that
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols But that's not what happened in the election? Look, I work in the political field, I understand lobbying, I understand politics. State reps didn't choose the president, the people did.  Educate yourself on the electoral college please
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I get it, double standards suck. But what you're arguing against in this context is easily mistake for just being ignorant to the big picture
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I'm not losing an argument, at this point, I'm just trying to educate you bc your point was so easily comprehensible that 1st graders get it. I know what you've been arguing since the beginning. Don't do to others what you don't want done to you, be the change, etc
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols That's actually not how it happened. The electoral college members voted according to their district. There are a lot of racists in a lot of districts. Him winning is a indication of what a lot of Americans believe in.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Trump is an effect of "All Lives Matter", that's why I brought him up
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols A lot of people like him, that's why he got there in the first place. Just bc you don't and the people you surround yourself don't, doesn't mean his supporters don't exist. Same with all the transphopic people you said earlier that were "few".
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols How do you not see the effect then? Trump is in office, and the same people who hate BLM and shout "All Lives Matter" the loudest are part of the reason he got there.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Do you pay attention to the news? Sorry random question 👀👀👀
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Intention =/= effect
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols "All lives matter, not just black ones!" Bc they get caught up on the wording, not what's actually being said. And by you saying "Not all cis people," you're ignoring the fact that on the daily millions of people mock gender identity and it's common.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols You're saying , "Not All Cis People!" When ppl bring up terrible things that men do, someone will ignore the injustice that happens and say not all men! When ppl bring up terrible things that happen to black people, someone will ignore what happens and say...
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I used the example, "Not all men" and "All lives matter" you only commented on all lives matter, so it turned to race.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols The war will always be going until bigots accept people for who they are. Being nice won't stop that
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols 1. Because while something may not be intended, that is it's effect.	2. I'm talking about minorities in general and used an anology and you responded to it
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Not everyone is a big person, I will not stand idly by while bigots bully, harass and oppress minorities just because I want to uphold the golden rule. I will not let people be hurt in the sake of niceness.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols It's the context in which it's said. I believe all lives matter, so my actions show it, when a group of people come out saying their people are dying and they choose to say "Black lives matter!" I say "hell yeah they do, how can I help?" Not "UM EXCUSE YOU, ALL LIVES MATTER!"
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols One joke highlights bigotry, the other undermines a person's entire existence. People need to be called out, otherwise oppression will continue to exist. I will always continue to call people out respectfully.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Yes, the slogan. I do believe that all lives matter, but when the BLM tries to talk about how Black Americans are continually pushed aside, even when they're literally dying, White Americans came in saying "All Lives Matter!" To silence them and push them aside as always
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Am I beating up ppl just because they're cis? Am I denying ppl rights bc they're cis? Nah, I'm laughing at a tweet that highlights the fact that when a trans person does so much as exist,  their identity is turned into a joke by cis people, not all cis people, but a lot
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Yeah, it is still wrong. But I care more about people's lives, not their feelings
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols All lives matter, but that slogan was created to undermine black lives matter. I'm going to ignore the fact you called me a scumbag
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols ... it's also them be denied service to places, not being allowed in the restroom of their identified gender, being beaten up, being raped, being emotionally abused and being kicked out. That's real prejudice.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols "grouping all cis people is prejiduce just as grouping all trans people is." This is what you said. I was arguing that grouping all cis people is NOT as prejudice as "grouping all trans people" because prejudice toward trans people is not just them being stereotyped...
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols "Not all men!"	"All lives matter!"		Just distract from the oppression and wrongdoings toward minorities to validate the fragile feelings of the majority.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Alright so while it's being implied that I'm sexist and hateful for doing nothing but being respectful and patient. I'm just gonna reiterate my point which was prejudice towards cis ppl does not have the same impact as prejudice towards trans ppl, which was ur original point
RT @kellyblaus: so.......what ur saying is......that ur a pedophile https://t.co/R7XzZM1a9f
@elka_1996 @brausbae @ugsadkid @_hoemo I think they mean that they used to laugh at jokes that make fun of gender identity/trans people made by cis people and now they know that they aren't funny
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols I know not all cis people are bad, I'm cis and I think I'm a pretty decent person. I know these posts aren't about me, nor every cis person. There's a large population of cis people that fit this stereotype, and Twitter has too little a word count to add qualifiers.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols Be an ally. Be an advocate. Use your principle to enact change through love and kindness. But also understand the group that needs your support the most is not cis people, it's trans people.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols To achieve peace, we need to acknowledge our prejudices and where they come from. Cis hate towards trans comes from a lack of understanding and fear of those who are different. Trans hate of cis people comes from the hate and abuse they've endured from that group.
@DesireeWolf182 @deadpistols When one group of people can use their prejudice and social power to suppress and oppress another group of people... it's not the same. It's also not just being an asshole, it's turning gender identity into a joke and using privilege to silence the struggles of trans people.

@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Yes, but traffic deaths are usually accidents. Another example of road rage killing in a less recent event https://t.co/e0FKNyNa1F
@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Melee weapons are often used in cases with people who have close relationships. https://t.co/0ZCAeUBRL8
@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour That's true. But you can't argue less gun related deaths would happen if there were less guns.

@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour But humans are volatile creatures. One quick, stupid decision can turn anyone from a law abiding citizen into a criminal.
@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Someone from my college (NAU) just got shot in the face because of a man with road rage. He was a law abiding citizen to begin with...
@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Obviously that isn't enough. Other countries have used stricter gun control,  and statistically, less gun-related crime has occurred.
@Cellenrun @2016bartender @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Guns, while I know can be used for sport (aiming and hunting), were created as a weapon to murder. Is someone's hobby worth another's life?
@Cellenrun @2016bartender @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Cars, Trucks, Planes and knives are all things that are designed with a separate purpose from killing or injuring others.
@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour American lives are being lost. Are we going to defend them or are we going to defend the right to keep guns, even though it was est. in 1791
@2016bartender @Cellenrun @John_the_L @SenBlumenthal @sexyliberaltour Well I can't change your mind, gun control is a very controversial issue and I can see both sides... but it boils down the the main issue:
Y'all care so much about American lives but when American lives are lost, ya wanna deny the easiest solution to saving them? #GunControl

You can be tough as hell and still wear your heart on your sleeve. Crying doesn't make someone weak- those who think that are just afraid.
