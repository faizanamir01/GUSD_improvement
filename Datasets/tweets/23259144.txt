@Carolin68871763 @realDonaldTrump I give you facts and you give me nothing.  What we do in our country isn’t your business.  You get biased, at best, info and insert your opinion.

@pdc2k6 @ebl1980 @xio_mart09 @wecoalesce @Alyssa_Milano I said I wouldn’t go to a country where I risk losing my children.  There are other options.  You are making assumptions about me that are completely false.  I have a differing opinion on what I would do in regards to my own family.  You can’t handle that.
@JimsRant101 @wecoalesce @Alyssa_Milano Sorry Jim.  Just pointing out the hypocrisy on the left to preach about MS-13 being people too, but not considering unborn children people.
@JimsRant101 @wecoalesce @Alyssa_Milano But MS-13 has a spark of divinity don’t they?  Unborn babies don’t, but gang members who rip hearts of bodies do....🤷‍♀️
@HootonOliver I have replied many times today.  I didn’t reply last night. I was busy living my white privilege life and watching @WestworldHBO. Then I went to bed.  I was merely stating my opinion on how I would handle my own family.  Why that is so upsetting to you is strange.

@WhiteWhiskers0 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump So let’s not recognize Kim as a legitimate leader?  What about a legitimate threat? A threat that has not been dealt with in years.  Even Obama told @realDonaldTrump NK was his biggest problem and he is attacking it full force.
@eyetide @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump I never said all were imprisoned during Obama but one was there for 3 years. Also Otto was during Obama.  And how many terrorists did Obama release in exchange for Bergdahl? Trump didn’t release anyone in exchange.  The left can never see any good.  That’s why you lose.
