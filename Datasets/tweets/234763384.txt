@cpirman12 @SecOfChampagne At least there are baby goats here... https://t.co/EXO9bWkF0e
@cpirman12 @SecOfChampagne Please no... 🥺
@cattleprod @SecOfChampagne I seriously dont understand how this is so accurate. I mean, it is accurate. Still baffled.
@dancanon @SecOfChampagne They really think we’re at work? 🤓
@SecOfChampagne Forgot to hit send? 😳
@nick__do I agree. 	The whole argument over text is a semantics argument that began when I challenged the premise of Medicare for all not actually being Medicare. (That kicked the “here are details” hornet’s nest.)	But totally fair and appropriate for all to plant their principle flags.
@choppadoo I agree! So why are Socialist Democrats  drawing a line in the sand over one proposal? There’s only one group of purists who aren’t willing to listen to other ways of redistributing $3.2 trillion.
@choppadoo No. That it’s as ridiculous as saying their views on healthcare are in any way similar. 	But you were trying to make a point.
@choppadoo Compelling point. Probably the same on the Space Force.
@choppadoo I also put my name on my Twitter... Sparrow? Nesting? 		And, as of today, the widespread support you refer to wouldn’t even be half the number of votes required to pass the House, much less the Senate, much less become law and provide affordable, universal coverage.
@nick__do Fair point. It's just funny that the people who have drawn a line in the sand and assert a no-compromise position don't have the specifics of the bill. Because, generally speaking, we're most likely going to agree on a vast majority of things.
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth What... the same team part? 	Or that you're from California and not even a KY-3 constituent?
@GOPJake @dsa_louisville Probably more fun than watching the Michael Cohen hearings.
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth Cool. She's on the Budget Committee (which he chairs), so I'm sure they're both working with THE SAME committee TEAM. 	Maybe he and others just want to see any number of proposals that would achieve the same goal of universal healthcare. While also reorganizing $3.2 trillion.
@cpirman12 @thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation only took 719 words. 😂
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth It feels a little weird because I can't find text on it anywhere, between https://t.co/4HoTrhTbpM and Google, it's a little odd to not be able to find it. (And that article only talks about the 120 pages and last year's bill, but it doesn't provide anything on this one.)
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth There's NO DRAFT. There's no legislation. 		I don't disagree with you that Congress doesn't even read most bills it votes on, much less cosponsor proposals without text... but what I'm saying is that you don't know what you're arguing on behalf of...
I just want to retweet this for (AMAZING) emphasis. If you're not a Bernie bro or Socialist Democrat, the purity test for Democrats is that you sign on, cosponsor legislation that literally has no text. None. The proposed bill has a title. But that's all. https://t.co/AKHaWFs0cJ
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth https://t.co/4N9WVjMi3m
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth There's literally NO text to this bill. How can he be against something that doesn't exist?? Hahaha!  https://t.co/VLzKmHWOHg
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth I know what he's been fighting for for 12 years in Congress... I know where he stands. So... he's got my vote.😂
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Once again, I agree. But you are the one who sent those two documents. I'm just pointing out the first inconsistency, which was in the first point made.	@dsa_louisville wants it to all sound so easy, and it's not.
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth 👍🏼
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod 100%. And no, you should not be intimidated. 	So why is @dsa_louisville threatening a primary challenge to @RepJohnYarmuth... who agrees with this principle (albeit vague). 		So, like I said, go for it DSA! 11 months to file.
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth Not to mention... https://t.co/cMkFYqOimQ
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod @RepJohnYarmuth The original story on this thread... https://t.co/IoPqtuhrqh
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Also, first point made "Universal Entitlement" says, 	"Authorizes the HHS Secretary to determine criteria of residency"		Just so you are all aware, this is the type of huge, gaping bureaucratic loophole that doesn't follow your aforementioned principles. (That's just line 1).
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Just did a quick search... literally not a single $ sign in the entire document. 		So, my first impression is it's a little lite on details.
@realscotttandy @RepJohnYarmuth @senatemajldr @MattBevin @Rand4KY Sounds as tho it was you who was triggered my good man.
@brohammersdad @dsa_louisville @cattleprod Or, single payer. Or universal healthcare. 		Oh, and by the way... @RepJohnYarmuth has advocates for and supports ending a (real) plan "that actually frees people from the agony of private, employer based health insurance..."
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod And just because it's commonly accepted in your bubble, doesn't mean it's commonly accepted. Also, I'm not for shorthand when it comes to overhauling a $3.2 trillion/year sector of the economy. I'm for overhaul, and for details...
@thibault_luke @dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Pedantic as in there isn't a single $ sign on @dsa_louisville's favorite chart. And it's not pedantic to mislead people into thinking something is Medicare when it's not. I'd like to win the debate on the merits, not piggybacking on a popular healthcare program.
@dsa_louisville @ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod Sweet chart. Very helpful... 🤦🏻‍♂️
@ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville Also, these two lines in your tweet contradict one another... "when it's clear you don't [know what Medicare is]. You are right about one thing- Medicare for All is not Medicare."
@ashleyeleanor @brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville You know what you call Medicare for All. What other refer to as Medicare for All is allowing anyone to buy into Medicare, regardless of age. 	My only point (which you acknowledge I'm right on) is that calling something Medicare for All has nothing to do with Medicare.
@dsa_louisville @brohammersdad @cattleprod Once you demonstrate that you understand what Medicare for All actually means, then your demand will have more credibility.	You're talking about platinum single-payer.
@dsa_louisville @brohammersdad @cattleprod Your list of principles shows you don't even understand what Medicare is. 	Medicare does not provide free, equal access to all medical services and treatments. 	All services are not fully covered. You don't just get to pick any doctor you want.
@brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville And as your list includes "federal legislation like Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All Act of 2017," understand that Bern's "Medicare for All" is NOT Medicare for All... it's a catchy title that bears no similarity to Medicare.	https://t.co/yjVTtpfcRR
@brohammersdad @cattleprod @dsa_louisville OK, but while you mean to be "something extremely specific," when overhauling a $3.2 trillion sector of the economy, it's very unspecific. This is a list of specific principles.
RT @cattleprod: @yarmuth @dsa_louisville A lot of elected leaders don't even have the guts to have a conversation about health care, let al…
@cattleprod @dsa_louisville The truly frustrating and scary part is that a lot of elected leaders use them interchangeably.
@cattleprod Yep. I can't speak to the wealth part, but, my only suggestion to progressives, @dsa_louisville and supporters of universal healthcare is to understand that many people use "Medicare for All" when they really mean "universal healthcare." They are not the same.
Maybe Louisville's Socialist Democrats should read the story... which (while not exactly correct) explains @RepJohnYarmuth has been a cosponsor of Medicare for All legislation for every year since he was first elected. 	But, by all means, let's get it going. 11 months to file. https://t.co/OC1A8AckGA

I drove through some of the Hurstbourne neighborhood over the weekend, and it occurred to me... 		Seeing how far away some of the “we oppose Topgolf” signs were from Oxmoor mall, how LOUD do residents think it has to be to disturb them?

@howielindsey Haha! Great call #NCAA corruption and hypocrisy at its finest.
@TishMoscow @RepJohnYarmuth No, I’d like for you to realize I’ve answered your questions. 	You just don’t like the answer. 		Isn’t your question about answering questions? 	Try calling his office, writing a letter or email.		Or just continue to Twitter attack. Whatever you like...
@TishMoscow @RepJohnYarmuth Nobody said it was bantering. I said not everyone on social media is a constituent. 		And if you want to get technical about it, he’s been answering questions daily while in office for over 4,000 days. That doesn’t include the months of campaigning before he was first elected.
@TishMoscow No to the other part while we’re at it. He’s answered to his 700,000+ constituents 5 times, and they like what he has to say and what he stands for...		Also, answering on social media is probable tough, given it’s a place for non constituents, Russians and whatnot.
@TishMoscow No, I’m not on the federal payroll... which is public record, so you can look it up instead of throwing nonsense onto Twitter.
@TishMoscow @RepJohnYarmuth Nope.

@OriginalKuiper (... Far from your representative.)
@OriginalKuiper @CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Says the person from Alaska.
@CARDSALLDAY26 Nah. I’m speaking up for facts. 	He’s been speaking on his own behalf to the tune of 4 reelections... he’s just fine.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth And that’s not an opinion to disagree with. That’s a fact... republicans defunding that subsidy is what drove costs up... that’s the economics of it. Insurance executives have said as much.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth You mean come up with a regulation? I agree entirely... hospitals should be audited. Until we know the true cost of care, we can’t truly know what compensation rates should be.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth And I agree costs are too high... I’m just saying it’s because Republicans defunded the mechanism designed to keep costs down.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth That’s not what those subsidies were. Cost sharing reduction subsidies would have kept down the cost of insurance. 	Not to mention it was quality insurance. 		And expanded Medicaid was coverage. That’s what Medicaid is... insurance for those who truly can’t afford it.
@MeganImel @mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth And yes... it did. Those are statistical facts.
@MeganImel @RepJohnYarmuth That’s because Republicans defunded the subsidies that would have kept the cost of plans down for everyone. 	They were called cost sharing reductions.
@mdlUK1 @CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth 480,000 Kentuckians have healthcare because of his work on the Affordable Care Act... Obamacare.	In fact, cut Kentucky’s uninsured rate in half. 	...that’s a way.

@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Probably because he never would imagine there’s a conspiracy theory about his citizenship...	Since you’re so interested in our family history... his father was a decorated WWII veteran and POW. One might say he’s from a good ol’ all-American family.
@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Wow. A conspiracy blog that doesn’t list a single name or author of its posts, doesn’t provide any information of it’s board, leadership or funders... 	I don’t mean this as an insult, but you’ve been suckered. 	And, advice: Don’t trust everything you see online.
@CryptonomicsPro @MeganImel @MauryRiddick @RepJohnYarmuth Somehow I don’t trust that you’d believe whatever his answer would be.
@MeganImel @RepJohnYarmuth Well, one thing would be donating every penny of his salary for the last 11 years to  local charities.

@eekshecried @phillipmbailey That’s also a nice thought, but we’re still back at “how.” 	I would also think the mentality “to impose hardcore gun legislation” would be contrary to “winning the hearts and minds.” I would think Republican pro-gun voters would need to buy-in, not be imposed upon.
@phillipmbailey @eekshecried Totally understand and agree. 	However, it’s a twisted world when this type of tragedy can occur, and it’s hard not to call for gun control... from a city or otherwise.

@cdbradley2 And you're conflating health insurance with car insurance! One is 1/6 of entire economy and something everyone needs. The other is a car...!
@cdbradley2 Dude, you said that's not how any other health insurance works. It's quite obvious that, yes, they all work that way...
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 This is a very simple concept.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Yes! If you are paying for car insurance and never use it... you are participating in a system to help cover the costs and risks of others.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Not to mention... car insurance is a horrible comparison because there is no similarity between cars and people, or cars and healthcare.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 If you are never in a car wreck (a healthy person), your car insurance helps other people pay for their car insurance when they need it.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Here's a car insurance analogy to Sarah's original statement... you might understand:
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Really not sure how you can acknowledge the ways in which health insurance is based on risk, and then say it's not how it works...
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Oh, and where you live... also a determining factor (based on risk).
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 https://t.co/5rRUdkvVzp	Preexisting conditions thanks to the ACA only means you can't be denied or charged more for essential benefits.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Thats not what preexisting conditions means. The higher risk model still stands. Smokers still pay more, as you age your rates increase, etc
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 I agree. 🙄 https://t.co/53aqKHlmSj
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 The mythical solution republicans like to talk about... "high risk pools" which don't work... it's all about risk.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 You're joking, right? That's all insurance companies look at... risk. Do you smoke? You're a higher risk, you pay more.
@cdbradley2 @tatesm09 Actually, that's exactly how insurance works. It's  the fundamental model of insurance industry. Shared costs makes it affordable for all.

@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes 2) This is a story about a lawsuit from 2014. Insurance companies have been shorted for 3 years, and raising prices on people as a result.
@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr @nytimes 1) Thank you Mike, that is my point! Insurance companies have had to raise cost because Republicans decided not to pay.
@TyUnderIce @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr America spends almost $10,000 per person per year on health care. Can you afford that? Insurance is the way to make healthcare affordable

@gupdiver @micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr My "source" is telling me you might be thinking of CSR (cost sharing reductions) which helps lower income pay for deductibles and copays.

@micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 2) impact of influx of new people into market. People who were disproportionately sick. That influx drove up costs.
@micomazuma @MssAnthrope @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 1) It's not Medicaid I'm talking about. The individual marketplace was supported with subsidies to insurance companies to brace for the
@micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr That's exactly what I'm saying. Since the ACA, Republicans took control of congress and defunded the mechanism to help insurance  increases.
@MssAnthrope @micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr I'm not. I'm in Kentucky... which is the national model for how expanded Medicaid and ACA should be implemented.
@micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr I understand it's expensive. My only point is that blaming Obamacare is misplaced. ACA would have kept costs down, but for GOP sabotaging it
@micomazuma @LikesScaryStuff @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 2 things: 1) ACA was partially created to provide freedom to be self employed an not have to worry about insurance thru employer. And 2)...
@LikesScaryStuff @micomazuma @MsDsSciLeague @SenateMajLdr 100% the ACA had support mechanisms to keep premiums down. Republicans eliminated that funding, then blamed Obamacare for rising costs.

@SamKing7185 @ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Right. When we spend approximately $10,000/year on every single person's healthcare, you have to share the cost.
Here in Kentucky, we know exactly what you mean... @MattBevin https://t.co/PwWVOigpyF
@EnPerpetuity @ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP I had a good source... or teacher. 😉 It's remarkably complicated.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP It's everyone sharing in the system that lowers the cost for everyone. Nobody can pay for their own cancer treatments on an as-need basis.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Elwood, this is how insurance works. I'm 33yrs old and healthy. I don't plan on getting sick, but I share in the system in case it happens.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP That's not how insurance works. For insurance to work, everyone shares in the risk.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Cool. Good luck Elwood!
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Insurance companies decided it's not worth it to them to come into a market, which might have disproportionately high number of sick.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP ...that's the deal... And, problem with free market is the market is too small. People either on Medicaid/Care or on employer plan.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Nothing is stopping insurance companies from offering coverage in KY. And I shouldn't have to pay for a lot of things, but I live in America
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP I don't know where local is, but Obamacare has saved rural hospitals thanks to Medicaid actually reimbursing them for their care.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Also, thanks to Obamacare, ALL insurance plans are GOOD plans. Unlike before when insurance companies could sell truly junk plans for cheap.
@ElwoodHolgrun @KYGOP Did you look into the subsidies to help you pay for it?
Since 2013, the uninsured rate in KY has seen largest drop in U.S. From 20.4% to 7.8%, and saved rural hospitals. Thanks again #Obamacare https://t.co/KVRhZFiV61
@KYGOP Wow! And the uninsured rate has gone from over 20% to under 8%! Thanks again #Obamacare 	Get real @KYGOP
So could the uninsured rate. Thanks again #Obamacare https://t.co/NDXAaAk96t

@OldKentuckyShrk @leoweekly It's a tough spot, but have to resist as much as possible. Force them to own the chaos they have created.

@NicholasDave "Belief system" jeopardized UL's accreditation in face of warnings. Beliefs should include respect for others' and process.
If Bevin and legislature serious about attracting business to KY, they need to govern responsibly...not reinforce outsiders' views of state.

@GovMattBevin At this point, the source of your misleading quote has as much authority on the ACA as any private attorney.
@GovMattBevin Further, you're intentionally misleading people, presenting this person as someone who IS part of HHS, when he is clearly not.
@GovMattBevin He's an attorney who worked for the BUSH Administration. He was at major DC law firm by the time ACA/Obamacare even written!

@RaeHodge apologies. I do want to give you the credit you deserve. You are beyond "qualified." I should have said "best," in previous tweet
@wdcc4falcons meaning he and/or his followers have already gamed the system (which I've admitted many times needs fixing).
@wdcc4falcons No, we can safely assume that his votes are not a reflection of our readers when he received votes in literally every category
@RaeHodge Is that "screencap" on Twitter "cheating?" Or is that something new editors need to learn?
