While Republicans have been busy cooking new ways to take away your earned benefits, Democrats are coming up with plans #ForThePeople. We will lower health care and prescription drug costs, raise wages, and clean up corruption in Washington.
The Seniors Task Force, which I co-chair with Rep. @DorisMatsui, recently released a report detailing the never-ending Republican attacks on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Read it here: 		https://t.co/LVhIMHx1OA
According to the @WashingtonPost, in President Trump’s USA Today op-ed “almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or falsehood.” On top of that, it LAUGHABLY tries to paint the GOP as defenders of seniors and their earned benefits. Don’t worry – we kept the receipts.

As we work to win full equality for women in America, we cannot overlook the retirement gap. Because they are much more likely to earn less than their male counterparts, women in America typically have far less money saved up for retirement.

Prescription drug companies will continue to raise the prices of prescription drugs for one simple reason: because they can. We need bold, decisive actions that get to the root causes of the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs, and the HHS Blueprint simply doesn’t deliver.
Today I led some of my Democratic colleagues in formally commenting on President Trump's drug pricing blueprint. While I am glad that the Trump Admin. has decided to address the drug price crisis, their blueprint for action falls far short of what is required to lower prices.
The President of the United States today publicly denigrated the U.S. intelligence community while praising one of the most adversarial foreign leaders in the world. This goes beyond incompetence and it borders on treason.		Full statement: https://t.co/Eu1CkLBCpv https://t.co/SphtzyehXh

For Erin, Taylor, Megan, William, and more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, we must keep fighting to #ProtectOurCare. 7/7
William is a former photographer who lost his eyesight (and thus his job and insurance) due to a massive stroke. Thanks to the #ACA, he was able to find an affordable and robust insurance plan, which would be impossible if President Trump and AG Sessions get their way.  6/7
Megan had a hard time finding insurance to cover pregnancy and childbirth. She found it thanks to the #ACA and had a happy, healthy baby. She’s at risk of losing her care if the Trump administration takes us back to the days when being a woman was a pre-existing condition.  5/7
Taylor is HIV positive. He wrote me the last time the GOP tried to repeal the #ACA to tell me about the rough road he faced until he was able to receive care at @howardbrownhc thanks to the Affordable Care Act. We can’t leave Taylor out in the cold. We must #ProtectOurCare 4/7
Erin is a type 1 diabetic. For years, she had been denied coverage because of this pre-existing condition. Thanks to the #ACA today no one can refuse to insure her and companies can no longer charge her higher premiums for her other “pre-existing condition” -- being a woman.  3/7
The Trump Administration is refusing to defend the #ACA in court, meaning that more than 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could lose their health care. Here are some of the stories that constituents have sent me over the years: 2/7
It’s hard to stay focused with so much going on, but we can’t lose our focus now. We can’t stop fighting to #ProtectOurCare. 1/7

I will continue to resist Republicans’ wrongheaded priorities. Americans demand better health care, safer communities, and a long-term solution for Dreamers. Once again, Republicans in Congress failed to deliver.
I applaud Leader @NancyPelosi, Ranking Member @NitaLowey , and the Democratic members of the Appropriations Committee for delivering real victories for the American people. However, I could not in good conscience vote in favor of a spending bill that leaves many Americans behind.

Another massive challenge facing women around the world is the unparalleled refugee crisis that rages on in virtually every corner of the world. Like most crises, the mass displacement brought on by conflict and strife is uniquely &amp; disproportionately affecting women &amp; girls.
Low-income women, women of color, and undocumented migrants are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, especially in the workplace.
High profile cases drove the conversation and encouraged victims and survivors to come out of the shadows. Now we must harness the incredible energy of those movements and make sure that we protect all women from this scourge.
This year, women made their voices heard when they spoke out against sexual abuse, harassment, and all forms of sexual violence in what came to be known as the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements
Today, following a particularly tumultuous year for women, we have many achievements to celebrate and a lot of work ahead of us.
Every year on #InternationalWomensDay, we pause to take stock of the work we’ve done to improve life for women and girls around the world and to recommit ourselves to conquering the many obstacles that are left.

The Trump Shutdown may be over. But for pensioners, veterans, victims of the opioid epidemic, families needing Community Health Centers, American citizens ravaged by natural disasters, and 800,000 Dreamers, it still feels like the Republican-controlled government is closed.
Since the fiscal year began almost 4 months ago, Republicans have kept our government running through a patchwork of one short-term funding bill after another. Almost 4 months later, we have no long-term agreement on a budget &amp; no action on our nation’s most critical priorities.
Republicans control the House, Senate, and White House, and are still somehow incapable of governing. I refuse to enable their recklessness. I will vote NO on their funding bill.

What we need now is the willingness from President Trump and Republican leadership to put the priorities of the American people above their partisan objectives. Let’s get to work.
If proposals like a reauthorization of Community Health Centers, the Butch Lewis Act to protect pensions, the Dream Act, or disaster relief funds were to come to the House floor, I’m sure they would pass.
Democrats are ready and willing to work on bipartisan solutions to end the Trump shutdown. I firmly believe that our priorities have bipartisan support.
We’re here because Republicans spent months working to pass a tax scam that gave 83% of its benefits to the wealthiest 1% in our country and neglected their responsibility to keep our government funded.

Republicans just can’t govern. They wanted a budget that slashed spending on crucial domestic programs, so they took hostages: our children’s health care, the fate of Dreamers, hard-earned pensions, and disaster-relief funds. The result? A #TrumpShutdown
President Trump’s OWN Defense Secretary said it loud and clear: short term continuing resolutions hurt our military. This is no way to govern. Republicans and the President, #DoYourJob. End this #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/uWgtLpG2p8

On the brink of a #GOPshutdown, the Trump Administration is using precious time to continue their attack on women’s health care. 		Mr. President, blocking care at @PPFA is illegal. Women won’t forget. #StandwithPP		https://t.co/tAWaeONMcR
This morning, as Republicans bring us closer and closer to a #GOPShutdown, they’re using precious time on the House floor to attempt to erode women’s rights to obtain safe, legal abortions. 	#PatientsOverPolitics https://t.co/r3EYooz2KZ
Of course¸ if a baby is born you do everything you can to keep that child alive. That’s the law. No one opposes that. But Republicans are pushing a bill that  would insert the opinions of politicians into medical practice–resulting in great harm to the health of women and babies.

The GOP bill fails to provide a solution for the 800,000 Dreamers whose lives were thrown into chaos when @POTUS ended  DACA. It ignores Americans whose lives were upturned by natural disasters by failing to provide emergency disaster funding for TX, FL, CA, PR or the USVI.
Republicans brag that this bill finally offers a long-term reauthorization of CHIP, which expired in September, but fail to mention that their bill doesn’t pay for the clinics that care for our nation’s children. The Republican bill completely neglects our health care system.
I'll be voting against the GOP bill to barely keep our government funded for another month. I refuse to enable Republicans, who have full control of our federal government, to keep funding our govt a month at a time, without addressing the most pressing crises facing our country.

In a time when hate crimes are on the rise, divisions are starker than ever, and racism runs rampant at the highest levels of our government, let us recommit ourselves to always standing up for what is right and what is good.
Dr. King presented us with the vision of a world where justice and love triumph over bigotry and hate.  He took action to make our society better.  He made us understand that each one of us has the power to speak out, to act and to change the world. #MLKDay

I continue to believe that the only path to sustainable peace is a two-state solution that allows Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side with economic prosperity and security. President Trump’s action has made that much more difficult to achieve.
There is reason that virtually all of our allies have urged us not to take this step.
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, but taking this step outside of the framework of a final status agreement derails the peace process, jeopardizes our ability to help broker an agreement, and creates the likelihood of more violence in the region.

Under the Republican tax plan, 1.9 million Illinoisans would no longer be able to claim the state and local tax deduction. Nationwide, 30% of middle-class households making between $50,000 and $150,000 would pay MORE in taxes!
This #BillionairesBudget would slash Medicaid by $1 trillion – threatening health care for 1 in 4 Americans. It would slash seniors’ Medicare by $470 billion. And this budget proposes yet again to repeal the #ACA

Today, after dropping a bombshell on millions of health care consumers, President Trump is probably jetting off to one of his properties to play a few rounds of golf.
Republicans in the White House and Congress are engaged in a massive #ACA sabotage effort that will drive up your family’s costs. If you see higher premiums next year, remember that they will include a “Republican surcharge” that could have been easily prevented.
Unregulated out-of-state plans are not an answer to making health care more secure or more affordable – they are a sorry and cruel attempt to look like the Trump Administration is doing something about health care.
Today’s executive order is the latest effort by the Trump Administration to sabotage the #ACA – driving up premiums, eroding consumer protections, and destabilizing the market.

I am truly sickened, and I will not stop fighting against this monstrosity of a bill.
Under the Republican bill, the average millionaire would get a tax cut of close to $50,000 a year.
All of this so that Republicans in Congress can give an enormous tax cut to their ultra-wealthy cronies.
and YES–it would mean people in the richest country in the world at the richest point in its history, dying bc they can't afford health care
it would mean children, mothers, seniors, and others on #Medicaid having their health care ripped away
it would mean people with pre-existing conditions struggling to find a plan to cover them
it would mean enormous job loss
it would mean more expensive plans with far worse coverage
it would mean Americans over the age of fifty losing health insurance because they can’t make their skyrocketing payments
it would mean hospitals and nursing homes closing
The Republican bill would result in 22 million people losing their health insurance

#Trumpcare by the numbers https://t.co/S6sxYWWV1V
This bill is a disaster and anyone who votes for it does so at their extreme peril.
The Republican attempt to improve #Trumpcare is like trying to put out a dumpster fire with gasoline.
17% – the percentage of Americans who support this bill –BEFORE the GOP made it worse
758% – the premium increase a 64 year old making $26,000 a year will pay because of the Republican age tax.
$600 billion – the tax cuts that millionaires, billionaires and corporations get.
$880 billion –the size of the cut to Medicaid, threatening health and long-term care for 74 million people
24 million – the number of children, adults and veterans whose health insurance will be ripped away.
Here are 5 numbers that show just how terrible this Republican bill is:
