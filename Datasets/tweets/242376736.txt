@nikkihaley was a strong voice and steadfast proponent for American values at the United Nations.  Her leadership and representation of our nation with be sorely missed.  I wish her, and her family, the best as she begins a new chapter.

TY 🙏 to the people of #PA15 for the trust you've shown in me, time &amp; again.  After my family, representing you &amp; carrying your voice to Washington has been the joy &amp; honor of a lifetime. #PA15Proud https://t.co/RgLGq2QkbT
It's with great sadness that Pam &amp; I learned of the passing of Barbara Bush. Her charm, compassion, humanity &amp; wit were evident throughout her time in public life. We convey our deep admiration for Mrs. Bush, our strong sympathy &amp; heartfelt condolences to the extended Bush family https://t.co/ct3001zAWg
After discussions with my family &amp; careful reflection, I have decided to leave Congress in the coming weeks. Serving the people of #PA15 has been a tremendous responsibility &amp; the privilege of a lifetime. https://t.co/p8mik6s8ix
Deeply saddened by the news re: Barbara Bush. She served w/ grace, dignity &amp; distinction both as 1st &amp; 2nd Lady. Further, she championed literacy for all ages.

This bill will serve as a House companion bill to a similar Senate proposal led by @SenThomTillis @ChrisCoons @sengraham @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; @SenBooker.
The US govt was designed to engender temperance &amp; withstand the headwinds of caprice. I'm proud to lead this bipartisan effort in the HoR that will ensure the Special Counsel can complete his work &amp; that faith in our most fundamental democratic processes is not further eroded.
In addition to establishing parameters for removal (e.g. misconduct, dereliction of duty &amp; conflict of interest, etc.) #HR5505 also requires a written notice explaining the reasons for removal &amp; allows challenges to be filed &amp; reviewed by a court of 3 judges.
Independent investigations must be assured that they have the authority &amp; public confidence to see their investigations through to conclusion. Jeopardizing the trust in these counsels paralyzes our political process &amp; devastates our established system of ✔️'s &amp; ⚖️'s.
Proud to join @PeterWelch in introducing the Special Counsel Independence &amp; Integrity Act (#HR5505), which would protect the integrity of independent investigations by ensuring judicial review if a special counsel is removed.
As we observe #HolocaustRemembranceDay in memoriam of the millions of victims who were senselessly murdered, may we remain vigilant in our commitment to ensure these events never happen again. #WeRemember #NeverForget
Although Paul's retirement will certainly be a loss for Congress, I respect his decision &amp; look forward to seeing what his next career steps will be.
I have greatly appreciated @SpeakerRyan's friendship &amp; his thoughtful leadership throughout my time in Congress. Though he would readily admit that he was reluctant to take the Speaker position, he answered the call of @HouseGOP &amp; led the House through a challenging period.
Martin Luther King Jr. was a trailblazer: a fierce advocate for equality before the law, a gifted orator, and a steadfast leader capable of rallying a country to self-reflect &amp; adamantly push forward toward a more free, more equal America #MLK50 https://t.co/YSWULKDJsY

This bill was in no way perfect, but letting the perfect be the enemy of the good has only increased the frustration that Americans have with Congress. I am pleased that President Trump has signed it into law.
The #omnibus passed by the House &amp; Senate, &amp; now signed into law by President Trump, provides necessary resources &amp; stability to our military &amp; our veterans, enhances border security, supplies increased funding for medical research via the NIH &amp; combats the #OpioidEpidemic.
Truly humbled to be the recipient of @usafmc's inaugural #ProblemSolvers Award. I began my 1st term in Washington committed to finding common ground &amp; working toward bipartisan solutions, never expecting any kind of recognition. What an honor!
But specifically, we're funding:		▪️Military medical facilities &amp; services	▪️Domestic military construction projects	▪️Disability compensation &amp; post 9/11 edu benefits	▪️New VA electronic health record	▪️Expansion of @ArlingtonNatl, extending capacity to 2051
Overall, we have appropriated:		✔️$10.1B to support military family members through military construction (31% ⬆️than FY17)		✔️$81.5B for @DeptVetAffairs (9.5% ⬆️than FY17)
I regret that our service members &amp; veterans have had to wait almost 6 months for us to complete our jobs, but I believe our @HouseAppropsGOP #MILCONVA FY18 bill is worth the wait.		⬇️Let's get into specifics ⬇️		📺: https://t.co/DD63CB5W8v https://t.co/CaWhA2i9E3

He was routinely undercut by POTUS &amp; was unable to hire key personnel because so many of the Republican foreign policy &amp; national security experts were disqualified for past comments re: Candidate Trump.
Unfortunately, the departure of Sec. Rex Tillerson adds to the chaos &amp; turmoil of this Administration. Tillerson is a good man who was dealt a bad hand &amp; he did not play it particularly well.

This week I joined 100+ House colleagues in sending a letter to POTUS expressing our deep concerns over his proposed steel &amp; aluminum #tariffs.		This tariff policy is misguided &amp; invites retaliation. More American manufacturing jobs will be lost than saved. https://t.co/xOEHVEpkvv
I strongly urge POTUS to rethink this misguided #tariffs policy. It's too broad &amp; will likely cost more American manufacturing jobs than it will protect. #PA15 companies like the Hershey Co will suffer, as they rely on aluminum as part of their packaging &amp; manufacturing process.
Additionally, I've joined @RepLanceNJ7 in calling for action to bring a #fixNICS bill to the floor. Guaranteeing that complete &amp; accurate info is entered into our nation's firearm background check system is a commonsense item that Congress should address quickly.

As I have publicly stated on several occasions, it's a mistake to release this memo. No Members of Congress-nor their staff-should risk divulging sensitive sources/methods of Intelligence for partisan gain. This sets a dangerous precedent that may have far reaching implications.

Regret to hear about the incident involving my GOP colleagues on the way to our retreat. I chose to drive out and am not on the train.
I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as House &amp; Senate leadership, to find a legislative solution for these issues.
As a body, Congress will not get off this treadmill of CR's until a bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement is reached &amp; that agreement won't be reached until there's an agreement on DACA &amp; border security.
This CR is only a temporary solution. It won't provide the stability &amp; consistency that the nation's govt, military &amp; federal workforce need in order to function properly.
Keeping the govt funded &amp; fully operational is one of the most basic functions of Congress. Regardless of which party initiates it, a shutdown represents an abdication of responsibility &amp; a failure to govern effectively.
This bill will:		☑️Provide critical funding for CHIP, giving it a 6-yr extension		☑️ Delay the implementation of the medical device tax, which would adversely impact companies in #PA15		☑️Retroactively pay federal employees (military &amp; civilian) who were furloughed
Last week, I voted for the govt funding bill (or CR) before the shutdown, and tonight, I voted for the CR that reopened the govt thru Feb. 8th.
@RepRickLarsen @lindsemcpherson You’re a great American.

#PA15Proud has never been more appropriate than for Brigadier General Anna Mae Hays, an exemplary patriot and Pennsylvanian.
Hays moved to the #LehighValley as a child &amp; always considered Allentown her home. Her rank &amp; military accolades made her eligible for a burial at @ArlingtonNatl, but she opted for her final resting place to be South Whitehall Twp, here at home.
It's impossible to convey in a single tweet thread the breadth of Hays legacy, both as a military pioneer for female service members and as a compassionate medical professional.
From WWII, to Korea, to Vietnam, she answered the call of duty w/o hesitation, serving in hospitals in Tokyo, #FortIndiantownGap (right here in Lebanon County) &amp; Walter Reed, where she counted President Eisenhower among her patients.
After Pearl Harbor, Hays joined an army reserve unit affiliated with UPenn as an Army nurse, thus beginning a distinguished military service record that would span decades.
Last week, #PA15 lost one of its own: Brigadier General Anna Mae Hays, the 1st woman in the history of the US Armed Forces to be awarded the rank of general. https://t.co/dgAe6YhUWB

Synthetic drug abuse is a national issue, but it affects us here in #PA15, too. #HR3537 is crucial to protecting our communities.
#HR3537 will help protect against overdoses &amp; gruesome killings like the one in Bethlehem that involved a man who had ingested flakka.
#HR3537 is critical in designating these substances as the dangerous and abusive products that they are.
Sadly through modifications to the chemical formulas of these drugs, there's been an increase in new substances and new victims.
#HR3537 would increase the number of synthetic drugs under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).
Today my bill #HR3537 the Dangerous Synthetic Drug Control Act will come to the House floor for a vote. It's time to act against these drugs
