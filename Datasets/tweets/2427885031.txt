Please join me in calling for action on policies that can end this scourge of violence and calling attention to people impacted by hate violence already this year. #SayHerName
It also requires that we create a climate where survivors are believed and empowered to come forward knowing their crimes will be thoroughly investigated.
Stopping the epidemic of hate violence will require concrete action from lawmakers through improved &amp; mandatory reporting of all hate crimes, passage of state laws that protect LGBTQ people, and expanded education &amp; training for law enforcement.
The rising tide of hate violence has had a devastating impact on Black people, LGBTQ people, religious minorities &amp; those living at the intersections. At least 26 transgender people were killed in 2018 alone – and many were clearly bias motivated crimes. https://t.co/O2H9YGJFgA

The patchwork of laws that currently exist leaves our entire community vulnerable to discrimination and attack. The Equality Act would protect the rights of all LGBTQ Americans by adding gender identity and sexual orientation to our nation’s non-discrimination laws.
50 percent of LGBTQ people live in states without legal protections. That means that millions of Americans are at risk of being fired, refused service, or denied housing simply because of who they are or who they love.
Speaker @NancyPelosi has just made clear once again that a top priority for the 116th Congress must be passing the Equality Act.

Congratulations to all our @HRC-endorsed pro-equality champions being sworn in today. We were proud to fight for you in last year's historic election, and now we’re proud to fight alongside you to advance equality for ALL Americans.
It’s been a long year, but let's take a moment to celebrate that in 2019 @realDonaldTrump will be met by SPEAKER Nancy Pelosi, Senators Baldwin, Rosen, and Sinema, and a diverse pro-equality majority who are going to help defeat his toxic politics of hate.

@mike_pence Today, as @mike_pence reads hollow prepared remarks, he himself is part of the problem. For decades he has stood in the way of real progress to combat HIV &amp; AIDS in this country and around the world. #RealMikePence https://t.co/jVMNcQ1JhS
@mike_pence As the outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS spiraled out of control, Pence was “reluctant” to lift a ban on needle exchanges. After the CDC intervened, Pence continued to drag his feet, waiting a year to sign off on funding. Meanwhile, 190 people contracted HIV in Scott County alone.
@mike_pence Just look at when @mike_pence was governor of Indiana. Cuts to public health funding helped fuel the worst outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS in Indiana’s history. The outbreak in Scott County was enabled by the closure of a Planned Parenthood clinic -- the county’s only HIV testing center.
.@mike_pence marking #WorldAIDSDay right now is truly the height of hypocrisy. From spreading misinformation about condom use, to contributing to a major outbreak of HIV &amp; AIDS in his home state, Pence has put ideology before the health &amp; lives of countless people. #RealMikePence

Key message from last night: Attack LGBTQ people at your peril. After ousting NC Gov Pat McCrory in 2016 for attacking trans people, in 2018 we overwhelmingly defeated anti-trans measure in MA &amp; replaced author of anti-trans TX bill with out pro-equality champion @juliejohnsonTX.
Exit polls show LGBTQ people made up to 6-7% of the electorate with 83% voting for the pro-equality Democrat. @HRC’s endorsed candidates fought for the LGBTQ vote and it carried them to victory.
By reclaiming a pro-equality majority in the House, we now have the ability to pull the emergency brake on this administration, pass the Equality Act, and protect healthcare.
Senator Dean Heller and half of the House incumbents we defeated had a 0 out of 100 on @HRC's Congressional Scorecard. The average score among them was 15. By ousting those who work against us, we now have partners in Congress who will work with us to move equality forward.
Last night we: 	-Replaced at least 23 anti-equality House incumbents with @HRC-endorsed candidates	-Re-elected pro-equality Senators in MI, OH, PA, WI, flipped NV, AZ too close to call	-Flipped 7 governorships including WI, NV, MI	-Dozens more state-level wins
Today you should be filled with hope. Last night was a resounding victory for equality &amp; a clear rejection of Trump &amp; Pence’s dangerous and divisive agenda. LGBTQ voters turned out in force in key House, Senate and state races nationwide. https://t.co/Y67sN2zKhm

Polls are open, let’s bring this home! Kicking off Election Day with the @HRC team in Arizona as we knock on doors for @kyrstensinema, @katiehobbs, @RubenGallego and pro-equality candidates up and down the ballot! VOTE! https://t.co/qZVEjvsz3r
If you haven’t cast your ballot yet, make a plan to vote TODAY. Once you make a plan to vote, urge everyone you know to vote. We’re on the verge of making history, and we can’t do this without you. Let’s go win. #turnout https://t.co/ZGBb4icFlt
That's why over the past 18 months HRC has invested $26 million+ in our largest and earliest grassroots expansion, deploying 150 staff &amp; mobilizing thousands of volunteers in 70 key races across 23 states. In the past 3 days alone, our grassroots army has knocked on 75,517 doors.
Despite all we’ve faced, I’ve never been more hopeful than I am today. With 10 million+ LGBTQ voters and millions more allies, we have the power to be the deciding factor in close races across the nation. https://t.co/9bCU0OMdu9
This is the day. After two years of relentless attacks on our community by @realDonaldTrump, @mike_pence and their cronies in Congress, this election is our chance to pull the emergency brake on this administration and restore sanity to Washington.
.@GinaOrtizJones isn’t just a trailblazer, she’s also the best candidate to represent the people of #TX23. @HRC is so proud to be on the ground in Texas working to help her make history on Tuesday! https://t.co/qRhicUHVmc

Turn out will determine the future of the state of Michigan &amp; the nation.

The LGBTQ community is resilient. As I travel the nation during this election, I see so much of that same grassroots energy. With 10 million LGBTQ voters &amp; millions more allies, we have the power to change history on Tuesday. Let’s make this the election of no regrets. Go VOTE!
We mobilized and organized… we built coalitions and changed hearts and minds… and we marched in the streets and into the courtroom. In just five years marriage equality was restored in California. And in seven, it was the law of the land nationwide.
Ten years ago tonight as we were celebrating the election of Barack Obama, in California we were mourning the passage of Proposition 8. In that moment some said the marriage movement was stalled. But instead of conceding defeat, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work.

Bombs mailed to Trump critics. Black customers targeted at a KY grocery store after a failed attack on a Black church. Multiple people killed at a Pittsburgh synagogue. All this week. We must hold accountable those who fan the flames of hate through their words—or their silence.

This is a direct attack on the fundamental equality of LGBTQ people. If this administration refuses to reverse course, Congress must immediately take action by advancing the Equality Act to ensure that LGBTQ people are explicitly protected by our nation’s civil rights laws.

@DougJones .@HRC was proud to mobilize our 18,000+ members &amp; supporters &amp; the nearly 200,000 Equality Voters across Alabama to support Jones last year. Today, we're even prouder to see him using his office to push for the rights of LGBTQ people, both in his home state &amp; across the country.
MOMENTUM: @DougJones signs onto the #EqualityAct! With his support for this crucial legislation, Senator Jones adds to the tremendous momentum for the Equality Act, and brings the number of sponsors to 245 — the most ever for any LGBTQ civil rights bill. https://t.co/amMeZiUuCc

It‘s unconscionable that lawmakers would even consider harming kids in need by turning away prospective foster &amp; adoptive parents simply because they are LGBTQ. @HRC is in Oklahoma with Freedom Oklahoma, business leaders, &amp; child welfare advocates fighting to defeat SB1140. https://t.co/s5YuI8G3DP
If Kansas passes legislation granting child welfare agencies a license to discriminate against LGBTQ prospective parents, those who will suffer the most are the children in need of a loving home. Must-read from @fosteradopt_org CEO Lori Ross: https://t.co/aXMxetnmC3
Headed to Oklahoma to join Freedom Oklahoma in urging lawmakers to reject SB1140, a license to discriminate bill that would allow taxpayer-funded child welfare orgs to turn away LGBTQ parents. This discriminatory bill will hurt kids in need, OK’s economy, &amp; must be defeated.

Thank you @RepJoeKennedy for standing up for LGBTQ youth &amp; families — and millions of others under siege day in and day out by the Trump-Pence administration. #SOTU
.@realDonaldTrump deserves no praise for managing to read a speech off a teleprompter. There is nothing “presidential” about the harm his reckless and hateful policies have caused to countless Americans. #SOTU
Tonight was another glimpse into the psyche of a man out of touch with the majority of Americans. We didn’t need to hear Trump’s #SOTU to know the consequences of his hate-fueled agenda. If you are LGBTQ, Muslim, Jewish, a woman, a person of color, an immigrant, you've lived it.
For a man who once claimed he would be “a friend” to the LGBTQ community, it seems @realDonaldTrump has now dropped the charade. Not even a mention after a year of unceasing attacks led by this administration on the LGBTQ community. #SOTU
Even with a teleprompter, @realdonaldtrump cannot hide his disdain for immigrants. His is an ideology rooted in racism and bigotry. We are not this. #SOTU
Because of Trump-Pence, hundreds of thousands of Dreamers — 75,000 who are LGBTQ — risk deportation to countries they've never called home. Trump must stop playing politics with innocent lives, and Congress must act. #DreamActNow
Reminder for Trump &amp; Pence: There is nothing religious about discrimination. When they talk about “religious freedom,” they are actually promoting a license to discriminate. That’s an abuse and misuse of religion. #SOTU
Personnel is policy. @realDonaldTrump has stacked his administration and the federal bench with scores of hateful and unqualified anti-LGBTQ officials. We will continue to fight these nominations at every turn. #SOTU
Transgender troops have done more to serve their country than @realDonaldTrump has in his entire life. His continued attacks on our military are a disgrace to the presidency and the nation. #SOTU

Thanks to all the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who used their time today to question Howard Nielson about his history of attacking the rights of LGBTQ people. His views disqualify him from the federal bench and his nomination must be rejected.
Nielson submitted this anti-LGBTQ argument in the Prop 8 case:		"Only if Chief Judge Walker had unequivocally disavowed any interest in marrying his partner could the parties and the public be confident that he did not have a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case." https://t.co/1SMyYbHJlT
Proud to see @SenKamalaHarris during her first day on the Senate Judiciary Committee holding Howard Nielson accountable for his anti-LGBTQ record. He tried to thwart the Constitutional rights of millions during Prop 8, and for that he should be flatly rejected.
Howard Nielson has staked his career on promoting anti-LGBTQ propaganda. The Senate Judiciary Committee cannot let Nielson be confirmed. https://t.co/79fuT74Lvx
During the Prop 8 case in 2011, I listened to Howard Nielson and his team argue that a Reagan &amp; Bush nominated federal judge couldn’t rule on a civil rights case BECAUSE he was gay. Then-Attorney General @KamalaHarris summed it up best: https://t.co/X5eOj0qnDc
Howard Nielson infamously claimed that a gay judge couldn’t be trusted to rule on a case involving LGBTQ rights. He is not fit to serve in the Judiciary.
While defending unconstitutional Proposition 8 in court, Howard Nielson argued that homosexuality is a choice. His views have no basis in reality.
Howard Nielson fought in court to defend Prop 8, the notoriously unconstitutional law that prohibited loving, same-sex couples from marrying in California. We fought him then, and we’re fighting him now.
