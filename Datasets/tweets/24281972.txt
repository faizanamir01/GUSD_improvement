@SarahatReynolda Hi Sarah! Renting a car would be best. The Olympic Peninsula is a 3-hour drive from Seattle. @wsferries leave from downtown Seattle to Bremerton every 1-2 hours daily. From Bremerton, it's a 1-hour drive to US-101, which can be used to reach the national park. Hope this helps!
@GeralynKrist Thank you! As are we!

@DaniSteckel I hope this helps a bit.
@DaniSteckel The Space Needle is the only place the does the fireworks and all of the venues under the Space Needle like the Pacific Science Center or Chihuly Gardens and Glass usually offer parties but not always super budget friendly. Last year I think tickets were around $85 each
@DaniSteckel You could also make your way up to Kerry Park which has an amazing view of Downtown Seattle that includes the Space Needle. You would not be the only one with this idea however so you would have to get quite an early start to save a space.
@DaniSteckel Hi Dani, 	Your best best for watching the fireworks on NYE and also keeping the budget in check is just to be out on the street near the Space Needle. You might have to walk around a bit to find your best viewing spot, between the trees and buildings etc but it can be done.

@GreatBlakes So you would have to ask them about long term parking during the cruise. There is also long term parking at the ports as well.
@GreatBlakes If you stay in Downtown Seattle you would be closer to the ports and some hotels have packages that include transportation but the price point is definitely higher. Take a look at @moorehotel for a downtown hotel with a better price point. Their parking is down the street..
@GreatBlakes This is a bit of a challenge. You might consider accommodations closer to the airport as the price point can be a bit lower and many of them offer complimentary parking. They are however farther away from the cruise ports and don't offer their own shuttles
@Staypineapple Yes!!

@corinnecahill Then while you are on the waterfront take your Harbor Tour on @ArgosyCruises If you have your passes already you could still do the waterfront activities but having your pass will let you bypass the line (if there is one) at the @space_needle
@corinnecahill Do you have your passes already? If not I would hit one of the slightly less crowded venues first to pick them up like the Aquarium

@JolieLoft of @MoPOPSeattle but that is me. We have so many other wonderful museums and you may or may not have time for more than a couple. If your interests are more geared toward art then @iheartSAM or @ChihulyGG maybe be better
@JolieLoft just hang out. That's 1. I also really like getting out on the water. Try a @wsferries  from downtown to Bainbridge Island. The views of the city and of #MtRainier are wonderful. The small town of Winslow on Bainbridge Island is worth exploring, very charming. I'm a big fan..
@JolieLoft That is such a tough question Jolie, so subjective. But for me I think a visit to @pike_place for sure. It can be crowded during the Summer and a bit overwhelming but if you can make 2 or 3 shorter visits it will be worth it. Dig in and go to the lower floors, eat for sure and.

@mp256 Many of the well know attractions in Seattle are located in the Downtown core which is very walkable. Maybe you are interested in museums, or maybe you want to get on the water and enjoy the view or maybe shopping is a must. All that can be done in Downtown as well
@mp256 It depends a bit on what you want to see...but a basic 3 Hour City Tour would be a great way to get started. They will give you a great overview and the "lay of the land" which should enable you to head out on your own to see things that interest you in more detail
