To build a system of protection it takes tools &amp; standards of operation. Build the Wall, its one of many tools, for the operation. Obedience is one of those tools.  All else is just excuses to keep people down &amp; poor.  Build the Wall.
The root cause of poverty is sin. Poverty is the tool of Democrats to keep the masses on their plantation system.  They pretend to be compassionate over tough times.  But actually, the tough times are created by them to keep poor people poor.  That is their MO, for 50 years.
@CraigAr64 The wall is a tool to the job. Stop human suffering against mankind. Build The Wall correct law loop holes. In Jesus name Amen The Lord &amp; Trump will prevail.
The Border Wall is a tool.  All the excuses and accusations made by the democrats are nothing more propaganda to distract from the issue. The more they blather their lies the more innocent human being suffer.  Those who accept &amp; ignore the problem have innocent blood on them.
