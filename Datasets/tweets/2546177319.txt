@vinnie_travi @kylemusic87 @SenSanders First off nobody is giving anyone anything. It is our money in the first place. If people are too stupid to save for their retirement then they don’t get to retire. A huge portion of the money paid into SS is going to people who play our flawed SS system.

@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris Here is a good example.. 1,505 adults surveyed.  We have 325.7 million People in our Country https://t.co/rrHtx6XSOm
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris I listen to what everyone says and then I apply common sense and form my own opinion.. I am sure that you have heard of Polls.. right.. 63% of Americans don't want a wall.. Those Polls are nothing more than a guess.  They call 2,000 or less people and say this what we all want
@SenatorShaheen its funny that your state would benefit from the extra funding that would come with any climate change bill.. But that fact is that our Planet Earth goes through climate change...  Ice Ages, Thaws etc..  This is not anything that we can control.. This is a complete waste of $$$$
@KamalaHarris Use some of this energy to teach our children to respect themselves.  Lets make it NOT ok to get laid at 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Honestly I am for a "woman" an adult woman that  her life is in imminent danger to have an abortion.  But NOT ok with young girls using it as birth control

@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris Did you know that your state alone spends $957 million per year to subsidize illegal immigrants ? Our country as a whole spends over 84 Billion per year..
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris Yes they put 1 billion on one of the bills that they proposed.  the 5.7 B would be for wall.fence, facilities for holding and processing legal immigrants, hundreds more border patrol agents and more judges to speed up the whole process
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris as it is now the only places where it has stopped illegals is where there are walls.. some of the large population cities have installed walls and there has been a huge reduction of illegals in there towns..
@Alex32528674 @CoffeeRaider @KamalaHarris What it will do is deter many from even coming.. I personally am in favor of high fences with surveillance cameras.
