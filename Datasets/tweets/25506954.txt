@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura All I’m saying is why is everything seen through the lens of gender? If women and men are the same why aren’t men speaking out too? Like where are all the claims of misandry from guys? I’m not trying to be an asshole I’m genuinely curious.
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura How else would you explain it? I’m not trying to be condescending. I can tell you that JJ is way ruder and is a bigger asshole to men. So why is the backlash entirely 100% from women? Literally not a single guy speaking out against him.
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura I believe he was an asshole to them and would never dispute that. He made a mistake of treating women the same way he treats men. Guys can handle it better I suppose. But if violence is being claimed an example needs to be provided as it’s a serious claim to level.
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura I agree that @ascannura can’t prove that JJ isn’t violent. 100% agree with you there. But aren’t you even a little curious what this actual violent act was? I get the whole believe all women movement but this is a worthwhile question to ask regardless of sex/gender.
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura But shouldn’t the starting point of this entire discussion be what he did that’s violent? Like if he wasn’t actually violent what are we even talking about?
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura So guilty until proven innocent. Also no way to prove your innocence because someone would have to be monitoring him 24/7 otherwise he theoretically could be violent while not being monitored. It’s a solid argument because you can’t be proven wrong.
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura Fair enough I just think before saying that @ascannura could potentially be wrong you’d at least confirm that there was actual violence instead of just assuming that’s a given. Just me though.
@TiaLovesMambo @ascannura Lost in all of this is the fact there isn’t any proof of @crayjliberman being violent in any way. Literally one person says he’s violent and you pile on because being part of a mob is fun and feels good.

@cailichris Obviously force and intimidation wrong. But isn't women wearing makeup deceptive as well? Women literally change what they look like
@sheknowshoney 🤔 I guess sometimes both but mostly the latter
@youvalzil 😂😂😂
@cailichris I think regardless women should not be trading sex and if they do shouldn't claim sexual assault when they get burned
@cailichris A female comedian I know basically made the argument that if a woman is tricked into sex even though consensual it's sexual assault.
@cailichris Not talking about Weinstein here what he did was 100% illegal and disgusting
Women in 2017. Treat us equally! Except when it's not advantageous of course.

@AndersYates Sounds good not really sure what else there is to debate anyway
@AndersYates So this is terrorism? https://t.co/O839GVoOND
@AndersYates Well terrorism by definition must involve violence. So drawing a Swastika on a synagogue isn't terrorism. Night!
@AndersYates I guess a hate crime could be emotional terrorism. Buts it's not actual terrorism.
@AndersYates And this one https://t.co/E8qTWD0fCe
@AndersYates And this https://t.co/WuD6nwQseQ
@AndersYates And this https://t.co/DDObRstjFl
@AndersYates Btw if you think that I don't think terrorism can happen at a mosque I totally do here's an example		https://t.co/ogaOFdhEbr
@AndersYates So then what's a hate crime?
@AndersYates People draw swastikas on synagogues all the time.Do u consider that terrorism? There's no realistic threat that more mosques will be shot up
@AndersYates How many were shootings? I didn't say mosques aren't subjected to hate crimes quite to the contrary
@AndersYates I think you're forgetting the Bataclan nightclub in Paris... 7 months apart
@youvalzil Valid point
@AndersYates Yeah I mean I kinda thought that was the point. To instil fear that things like that are certain to continue. ie Irish bombings in the 70's
@AndersYates It's a guarantee there will be more car rammings in the name of Islam is the near future. Mosques getting shot up not the same likelihood
@AndersYates Not to be dismissive of pigs heads being left on their steps or threats made the fact is those just aren't comparable to actual murders
@AndersYates That's where I disagree. Mosques aren't shot up regularly at all. However car rammings in the name of Islam are regular occurrences
@AndersYates I think it was a hate crime and I think it would have 100% been classified as such 10 years ago. But the line seems to be blurring now
@AndersYates No but I think closer to that than terrorism. Obviously still don't know the motive. I do think the Quebec mosque shooting was a hate crime
@AndersYates Yeah might just be recency bias. Vegas shooter - terrorism. Edmonton incident - not terrorism. Both incorrect assessments imo
Can we just implant phones in my brain already so I don't have to carry this thing around anymore?
Is there a rule where all pet related business names have to be a play on words?
Is it me or does the left want to call all hate crimes terrorism now and all terrorism regular crime?

@CavernsPod @devonhenderson and you just chose from the last 7 shows but if you include the first 6 it's 6/66
@CavernsPod @devonhenderson there's 3000 comedians in the Toronto Standup FB group and there's a 150 person list of female standups. ~5%
@devonhenderson only 5% of standups in Toronto r women yet almost 10% of the spots on these shows went to women. Curious what the issue is?
