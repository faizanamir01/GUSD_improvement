@IlonaWestfall I look back and think about this a lot.
A final thought: Most people in the service industry could tell you their own similar stories - they just didn't go viral. https://t.co/C1pnVfOPwg
@KapustaDiamond yeah, I mean marketing is a pretty specific skill and unless there's a dedicated person who knows what they're doing that happens all-too-often with events in Cleveland in general 😔
I saw poetry slams, author talks, world music and a book reading set to live jazz at the Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern - along with the usual rock bands. It was its own place. If anything, we could use more programming like that around town.
A lot of takes around Cleveland about the Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern closing (😓), but what we're not going to do is say "it didn't live up to the spirit of the old Euclid Tavern." https://t.co/ZOxKHjSYSi
I see a lot of people predicting the fate of this restaurant, and it's worth questioning if that would still be so if it wasn't an unestablished name without power and prestige. And if it had happened behind closed doors, as these things often do in the service industry.
If a restaurant owner says this in the comment section of a major local publication, maybe believe women when they tell you about that thing someone said to them in the kitchen, at the hostess stand, behind the bar or in the manager's office. https://t.co/wOwrZ745KT

@kristaalvy So sorry about your father-in-law.❤️
@kristaalvy My mom has stepped into a full-time caretaker role and she just amazes me. The hospice workers are so kind and helpful.
So much respect to hospice workers - and caretakers in general - who are brave and compassionate beyond belief.
I found the write-ups from 2003/2004, when my late uncle (a photographer-turned-chef) opened a bakery in Rhode Island.

@g_in_cle @LawrenceHall105 Good point. The headline wording could still be different, I guess. 🤷‍♀️ Maybe if I just keep believing it the weekend will truly start on Thursday.
@LawrenceHall105 ha! :) I like to include Thursday stuff because sometimes those events are scheduled that day because it's *so* hard to compete with the big-name events in Cleveland. I get what you're saying, though! Let's start our weekend early this week.
Cleveland's Plum restaurant is bringing together chefs from around the region to raise money for the National Alliance for Mental Illness Cleveland Chapter. https://t.co/gwlzwIc5dY
@LawrenceHall105 Yeah, I always start it on Thursday. A lot of weekend events - especially in the arts - kick off on Thursday and run throughout the weekend! I get what you're saying, and maybe the wording could be confusing, but it's pretty common for event calendars. ☺️

@LoquaciousC (obviously, plenty of people want to do homebrewing and have no desire to get into that realm in the first place!)
@LoquaciousC I was re-reading this (from 2015) a few weeks ago and it talked a lot about homebrewing. It made me wonder what talent we don't see in popular spots, which obviously have barriers to getting a foot in the door or opening one yourself. https://t.co/ikVIRMrrFz
RT @WiseJournalist: https://t.co/EP97ItkmQg
@LoquaciousC Right! It was obviously one bad social media call likely by just one person, but it doesn't help anything. As someone not immersed in homebrewing, I've been curious lately about this kind of thing (diversity/attitudes/etc.) in that realm.
@g_in_cle I walked by there last night and it seemed like they were doing some renovations. I really liked The Fix, but at least it sounds like they're carrying over some of the favorites to the Legacy menu.

@ShibaniFaehnle Not sure who’s behind Lunar Cow, which posted the meme. Was just noting that it’s ironic to make this mistake when we have another beer/tourism thing in Cleveland *owned by a woman*! (Doubt she would slip up on something like this.)
Like anywhere, Cleveland has a lot of hot takes on beer but my lukewarm take would be I’d like it to be inclusive and successful. I talk to a lot of small/mom-and-pop businesses that depend on big orders from breweries.
I mean, the irony of this happening here is a Cleveland woman is a co-owner of her own successful beer tour business and even co-wrote a book on local beer.  https://t.co/6PZ4DmAQQS

@synoisia @knitgrrl @KapustaDiamond @in_shambles tbf I think the post was saying artisan-y twists on fair food, which whatever, a bar here does that and I like it! But never disparage fair "design" in my presence, I love it too much. 🤣
@synoisia @knitgrrl @KapustaDiamond @in_shambles I said @ Beth that I actually ~love~ fair design. If we really wanna get into that ... you'd think the handlettering would be more *artisan* and on-trend anyways?

@Kevin_Timm I think the higher up artists are pretty popular. I think they could have engaged the locals more, but otherwise it's not bad for a first-year fest. It's pretty eclectic, though, so I'm not super into some of the acts, but I feel like that's to be expected with any fest.
In a twist of fate, someone can't go to the Cleveland music fest, InCuya, and passed along their tix to me. (I just spent a lot of unexpected money on cat surgery, so it wasn't really in my budget this month. 🐱)

@EricWBunch @schmangee @atelierivaan right - if people are feeling they have to dash across the street, are we giving them enough time at lights, etc? More questions (instead of assuming they darted out) can lead to finding bigger environmental issues.

@melanie_hersh And like I said, I don't think they're doing anything wrong by not adding more. Do I think it would have gotten some more buzz/local people excited about it, though? Probably. That's why I was surprised!
@melanie_hersh For sure - I don't think big art projects ever have any obligation to work on a local level. But when it comes to marketing/enthusiasm, that's another story. I don't think you can take diff approaches and expect the *same* reactions.

@jeffsleasman it's a Lady and the Tramp level of cuteness of which I'd only dream to achieve if I had a pupper
@jeffsleasman yes 🐶
I have returned to my lane for a Saturday night, which is writing about a dog cookbook.
@inthewabe @jeffsleasman @evidentialdread It's probably part of it! And like, I v much get in the mindset of "I don't know how to explain to you that caring about this is important." But sometimes things do need explaining!
@jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @inthewabe I also think it's a good approach because it's probably the only one that works. (My thread was just meant to say that's unfortunate!)
And to be clear, I'm NOT knocking the approach. We should be ready either way. But if they felt like cities would work with them, they'd have way more of an opportunity to control their narrative. Instead of leaving it to people writing stories about scooters "being lit on fire."
@jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @inthewabe Exactly, I'm not knocking the approach. I just said to Kevin: If they felt like cities would work with them, they'd have way more of an opportunity to control their narrative. Instead of leaving it to people writing stories about scooters "being lit on fire" for the lolz/traffic.
@inthewabe Exactly. And if they felt like cities would work with them, they'd have way more of an opportunity to control their narrative. Instead of leaving it to people writing stories about scooters "being lit on fire" for the lolz/traffic.
@evidentialdread @inthewabe And when they *have* to do it that way, it's easy to find negative things online. I'm moreso saying that it's a PR/media hurdle than saying they're doing anything wrong. And if the things you said weren't true, it'd be way *less* of a hurdle.
@evidentialdread @inthewabe I agree, and to be clear, I'm not knocking the approach at all. I'm saying it shouldn't *have* to be via the guerrilla approach for the reasons you stated (though we should be ready even if that is the way they chose to do it!).
@inthewabe Exactly. I totally get + respect it. It's just that they've done it in enough cities now that there are a bunch of not great stories out, and the "funny" critical ones get shared and dominate the SEO when you google them. (Not to get nerdy, but also I'm kind of nerdy.)
I have a complicated relationship with nostalgia but I do love a good vintage/antique store. https://t.co/ZVs94Uk0ee
Anyway, IDK the best method. But it's obvious that the guerrilla approach is a statement about it being hard to work with cities (all over). I think about how much more smoothly things would go - from a PR/education curve/etc point - if it felt like they could remove that hurdle.
I am by far no expert on this stuff. A kind person from On Here sat with me and answered all my "but what about---" questions (with nuance!). And got me thinking about bigger things like this. 	https://t.co/ztDKEraRwq
Go to Bird's site and you'll find this ... at the end of a PDF. https://t.co/TjZUJMCKWJ
lol the first story that pops up for me: "Fed-up locals are setting electric scooters on fire" (A great folksy and fun reporting approach, because who doesn't love to make fun of reactions to a positive thing with kinks to work out!)
Bird makes a statement with the guerrilla technique - it's one I appreciate. People also get confused, and Google it and ... up pops a bunch of stories with very little nuance. (And there's obviously a lot of nuance to be had.)
I've been antiquing all day so I haven't been able to tweet about Scooters. But the former PR person in me has thoughts.
@Nickoloffoff I know 😐
@AWolfeful oh no I had not thought about this until now 😭

@gorealfar @jeffsleasman @atrubek @evidentialdread That's a good point. A lot of my artsier friends have been posting about just now discovering it. I have a lot of feelings about this.
@jeffsleasman @atrubek @evidentialdread @gorealfar I honestly haven't been getting to as many things as I'd like to over the last year in general, but have wondered what the feelings + attendance are for this! They have had quite a few interesting events w/ Glenville Front Porch/Arts Campus.
@atrubek @jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @gorealfar I'm almost never the type to complain about bringing in outside talent (and realize that's the roster for most of these types of events), but this concept from a NY artist to either tell the neighborhood history or "open our eyes to gentrification" seems ... off in general. https://t.co/FUUGblcgUn
@atrubek @jeffsleasman @evidentialdread @gorealfar I'm also confused - it says they asked her to make a piece about the history of the neighborhood (which ... seems strange and parachute-y), but also later says that they had originally wanted her to bring one piece (mislabeled in the story) and she changed direction?

I've seen two stories on FRONT Triennial that have quoted Uber drivers to, I guess, capture "what the everyday Clevelander feels about a big art event"? Ya'll ... this is not just "small town, Midwestern" drop-in trope-y, but ... also lazy reporting.
Maybe I have a chip on my shoulder because I remember a parachute journo tried to make some sweeping commentary about a cab driver not knowing about Sokolowski's during the RNC in Cleveland.
A weird travel writing cliche is quoting a single Uber driver, as if to symbolize what ... every person in a city thinks or feels? I realize it's tempting to use moments that feel serendipitous, but like, sometimes you have to know when to cut things out of a story.

@krissiepotato @evidentialdread @jeffsleasman @anniezaleski @rustbeltrants @TomHorsman Good point on the distance. Free parking + more lots are definitely not (ever) the answer. If people with disabilities are saying hey, this is a hurdle for me and stops me from going, I am def all for looking for the small, incremental changes like this thread is calling for.
@evidentialdread @jeffsleasman @anniezaleski @rustbeltrants @TomHorsman @krissiepotato I'm with you, of course. More paid parking = less driving = more spots available, for sure. I can't remember off-hand how much of the street parking spots around there is designated accessible parking. Maybe it just starts with increasing that #.
@evidentialdread @jeffsleasman @rustbeltrants @TomHorsman @anniezaleski I totally agree. I don't think free parking is ever an answer. I think the thread started with just observing that it wasn't the most accessible place, and what the possible solutions could be. I don't think there's any easy solution, but it's definitely worthy of conversation.
@jeffsleasman @rustbeltrants @evidentialdread @TomHorsman @anniezaleski free parking is always bad, but i feel this thread is getting away from what seems important: better ways for public institutions to serve those with disabilities, especially if you want them to live downtown and better serve a diverse urban population

@TomHorsman This wouldn't change Cleveland as we know it but - Passport app to pay for parking downtown (or the credit card machines, literally anything but quarters)
@TomHorsman @rustbeltrants @anniezaleski You know I'm pretty much always anti-more parking, but I have thought when going to the library that it seems like it could be difficult for older patrons + those with disabilities. Street parking can be hard to come by. (Not sure the solution, but I have also thought about it.)

Was worried my quaint story about a local manufacturer of a giant inflatable duck would not generate much interest, but it turns out there's a twitter account dedicated to "ducking" issues in Ohio politics that has found it, so I'm good on likes and shares.

@cacoughlin Yes, please! Hope to see you and selfie with you. 😂
@NickShamhart I get it! I didn't get tickets because all big events with big queue lines (ie Hamilton) make me unexplainably nervous/anxious, but was lucky enough to recently get some kind of preview invite. I'm sure it will be a pretty cool experience.
Can't believe I had to use my first rant of the day on letting people just enjoy things. (ง'̀-'́)ง
If you don’t want to take photos, I don’t know, just ... don’t? But otherwise, as long as you don’t break stuff or shine your flash in my face, experience a brilliant art exhibit however feels right to you.
@chezrebellion I actually don’t know exactly how check-in works! I may get a better idea after the little preview.
Telling people how they should or shouldn’t interact with art seems counterintuitive in general, but I’m not trying to get philosophical over Kusama On Here.
@cacoughlin Yes, I’ll be there around 2! 😺
My timeline is getting overly intense and lecturey about how people should or shouldn’t interact with the Kusama exhibit coming to Cleveland, so I’m going to photograph and selfie everything because art is meant to be enjoyed however you want. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@jeffsleasman I also feel terrible because I swore this had been covered! But then again I covered ioby when it first came to Cleveland so I see its updates more often. I wish I could have made it to that talk, it sounds like it was great.
@nczeitgeist Right? I think that way more often than not. But also, I recently saw a couple comments on a profile piece that were like "hey, fyi, this guy has been accused of assault" ... and the comments were then shut off. That kind of thing is obviously a *total* outlier, though.
@nczeitgeist I get it - I have a lot of *thoughts* on comments we can talk about sometime, but anyway, you'll see there are no comments on prom-related stuff.
@nczeitgeist Yeah photographers get permission ahead of time and state where they're from. (A lot of kids perk up about it tbh - or kindly decline.) You don't have to apologize - not like your thoughts on something should ever change based on who writes (or uploads) something!

This Cleveland bar is transforming into a one-weekend Mos Eisley cantina in honor of May 4. I talked to owner John Fuduric about what you'll see, from a 7'6" Chewbacca to his DIY build-out of some of the decor. https://t.co/XHDWD0Sa2P

@Tribe_XX @TerryMetterJr @KapustaDiamond @skorasaurus Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park is a bit of a way out but they do book some stuff in that realm as well. Likely not *as* old school but a cool place.
@TerryMetterJr @KapustaDiamond @skorasaurus exactly! I can think of a lot of great bands they could have added to the already great ones to mix it up. (The lack of local hip-hop/electronic was a glaring omission to me for a fest like this and should have been *really* easy to book! Hopefully they add more in coming weeks.)
@KapustaDiamond @TerryMetterJr @skorasaurus That said, I get why nonprofit type fests have to have people pleasing bands. But a place with money like AEG could have definitely mixed it up more with no care about money or funders. 🧐 Feels like @skorasaurus noted, they get stuck in a loop of names they’ve heard before.
@KapustaDiamond @TerryMetterJr @skorasaurus yeah, as someone who moved to Cleveland in college and knew nothing about the local scene, it didn’t take long for me to go from “Lighthouse &amp; the Whaler” to “noise lunch” with a little help. (I like both!) But it did take some guidance.
@TerryMetterJr @KapustaDiamond @skorasaurus I’m with you (was disappointed a fest with money to take risks ... really didn’t at all). BUT some of the bands orbiting these circles (decent accessible poppy music) have told me they’d submit time &amp; time again to at least one of those venues and never got booked. 🤔

Local acts for InCuya Fest in Cleveland this August include: Tropidelic, Seafair, Ezri, Dreamers, The Jack Fords, The Modern Electric
Lineup for the new InCuya Fest in Cleveland Aug. 25-26 includes New Order, The Avett Brothers, SZA, AWOLNATION, K. Flay, Earl Sweatshirt and Cake

@KapustaDiamond @B_McElhatten @jeffsleasman @atrubek La Placita is awesome. And since it's supposed to be like an incubator to eventually grow into a retail/mixed-use space, maybe that goes along with what Anne was saying about the model of sticking with vendors.
@atrubek @B_McElhatten @jeffsleasman @midwestcraftcon they are. Groundswell is/was still doing "pop-up" stuff, but there were a lot of factors in that space closing out of their control. I know they're doing the other Hustles stuff in Slavic Village which I still have thoughts on.
@jeffsleasman @atrubek @B_McElhatten @midwestcraftcon Wasn't Fount a Cleveland Hustles thing? True with Oceanne though. I don't want to see the same stuff at *every* show. Flea is complicated a bit with the Indie Foundry side business where she helps with branding. But in general shows, I don't know about that.
@jeffsleasman @B_McElhatten @atrubek @midwestcraftcon Right -- with shows you just have to know that some aren't going to be as good as others based on outside factors. Like, personally I wish MORE were on the same day, while that's probably counter-intuitive to organizers.
@B_McElhatten @jeffsleasman @atrubek @midwestcraftcon I also think no matter how exciting of an "experience" it's made, some novelty wears off eventually. Plus, weather can be such a big factor to put all your eggs in one basket for one weekend. Why I hope more retail works out - but then they're also competing with the events.
