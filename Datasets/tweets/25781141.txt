Today, the House passed a resolution I authored remembering the victims &amp; survivors of the 1932-33 Ukraine Famine, known as #Holodomor. Its passage is another reflection of the basic values of the American people. | My statement: https://t.co/oLTmsw01zB

...the GM layoffs &amp; plant closings underscore why #NAFTA remains unpopular in industrial areas. The new NAFTA - renamed the #USMCA to avoid any association with the old one - still falls short on providing protections for workers, jobs, &amp; wages. | My op/ed https://t.co/XtF205PTIg
Without changes, in law and practice, that address the suppressed low wages &amp; dismantle the so-called protection agreements in Mexico, the new #NAFTA will continue conditions that have led to outsourced American jobs. https://t.co/vGbhyWXsEm
When he authored an article commenting on the continuing friendship that I shared with Gov. Milliken, I very much treasured it.  As we continued to stay in touch, he as always maintained his warm spirit despite the challenges he faced. So very many of us will very much miss him.
It was with deep sadness that I learned that George Weeks passed away. I got to know him first as press secretary for Governor William Milliken. Like the Governor, George combined civility and total dedication to his work and ideas.
The new #NAFTA fails to forcefully &amp; directly address the lack of assured &amp; real labor reform in Mexico, in language &amp; in practice. Failing that, it will only lock in the status quo of massive outsourcing to Mexico for decades to come &amp; its consequences. https://t.co/TAVWO5ub2F
There has been this major shift of production to Mexico. So much new #NAFTA talk centers on rules of origin and composition percentages but misses the core problem of suppressed, low wages in Mexico that leads to the race to the bottom that contributes to American jobs lost. https://t.co/EqcRTNyxyJ
The recent GM announcement must serve as a major wake up call. Mexico’s persistent, suppressed low wages of a few dollars per hour caused a major outsourcing of vehicle &amp; supplier production to Mexico, suppressing American wages &amp; creating job loss. - https://t.co/iceSPxNyxO

This has been calculated to save $1.4 billion annually by the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services. I have introduced H.R. 5150, the Protecting Medicare from Excessive Price Increases Act, which would establish such a program in Part B.
A better way to address growth in Part B drug prices would be to follow a recommendations by the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to require drug manufacturers to provide rebates to Medicare when the price of their drug increases faster than inflation.
Moreover, changes to Part B could shift more costs onto seniors and in some cases may jeopardize access to chemotherapy for cancer patients.
This will likely have only a modest impact on overall Medicare spending and will do next to nothing to force drug companies to limit growth in the cost of their drugs.
Instead, the Administration has put forth a package that addresses relatively narrow issues in Part B while completely ignoring the rapid growth in the Part D program.
Pres. Trump again failed to call for basic reforms that meaningfully cut prescription drug prices, e.g. allowing seniors to import lower cost medications from Canada or to allow Medicare to directly negotiate w/drug manufacturers, despite his repeated campaign promises to do so.

Based on earlier discussions &amp; information available today, there is no such assurance that this core issue will be adequately addressed. Unless it is, I don't believe that there will any significant Democratic support for the revised #NAFTA, most likely necessary for its passage
A revised #NAFTA must assure that this pivotal issue be effectively addressed. The Administration has not consulted effectively with Congress or shared the existing text.
Two groups of workers - independent union vs. CTM-controlled - highlight the need for labor reform in Mexico which, under #NAFTA, has maintained a policy of suppressing industrial wages/worker rights resulting in outsourced U.S. jobs. and lower U.S. wages. https://t.co/AVz9LoxzXA https://t.co/Y2K0lOqTBI
Earlier this year, Reps. Pascrell, DeLauro, &amp; I - along w/ +180 House Democrats - reminded the Trump Administration failing to directly address this problem w/ enforceable measures leaves intact a system that promotes outsourcing &amp; harms American wages https://t.co/SL50VqBDWT
I strongly urge the Administration to stay at the bargaining table as long as it takes to ensure a good deal for America’s workers, and to consult with Congress as required by law.
After today’s announcement that the U.S. and Mexico have come to an agreement on a revised #NAFTA, it remains highly unclear whether there will be assured, substantial change in the status quo on this key issue.
Meeting just now with a group of workers in Mexico who were fired from their jobs in a tire factory after they went on strike to protest wages of less than $2 an hour made it crystal clear how far Mexico still has to go to ensure real labor rights.
If a rewrite of #NAFTA fails to forcefully and directly address [suppressed labor rights &amp; wages in Mexico], the result will just be more downward pressure on American workers’ wages and outsourcing of U.S. jobs to very low-wage Mexico. https://t.co/PZb2ka2Hge
We hope our trip will further illuminate the essential importance of this issue, especially as negotiations over #NAFTA have reached a critical juncture.
Any new #NAFTA cannot address this critical problem indirectly or with half measures. It must tear down this long-standing structure now embedded in many thousands of so-called protection contracts, which were signed with no real input from or knowledge by workers.
Mexico's industrial policy of keeping wages low by suppressing workers' rights has led to the outsourcing of U.S. jobs, while also keeping Mexican workers from rising to the middle class.

The more the American people learn about the Republican tax bill, the more they will reject it, just as every Democrat did today on the Committee on Ways and Means. 4/4
Speaker Ryan has said the bill is focused on the middle class, but that is simply not true. It’s really the opposite: it’s a bill built for millionaires. And the process used to consider it has been driven by desperation, rather than deliberation. 3/
While the GOP bill gives the very wealthy enormous tax breaks, it actually raises taxes on tens of millions of middle-class families by eliminating the personal exemption and deductions for medical expenses, for full state and local taxes, and for educational needs. 2/
The Republican tax bill picks winners and losers – the big winners are the very wealthy and some corporations, and the losers are the middle class and those who aspire to it, and the rest of America who will be forced to pay for the bill’s massive debt for years to come.  1/

No matter your ideology, cutting HC is the wrong RX for America. Read my full op-ed here https://t.co/e8Vcn2OblC via @detroitnews
Regrettably, GOP vision for health care consistently focuses on cutting assistance for Americans: Medicare, Medicaid, or repealing #ACA.
Our focus should be on supporting and strengthening Medicare, not undermining. 57M Americans depend on it — including nearly 2M in MI.
Medicare vouchers are  unpopular. 2015 poll found that 70% support keeping Medicare as it is, only 25% support shifting to voucher
GOP claims current seniors would be exempt from change, but once basic guarantee of Medicare eliminated for some, it's at risk for all
This attack on benefits for seniors is particularly misguided in a budget designed to pave way for huge tax breaks for wealthy &amp; lrg corps.

It is really unfortunate &amp; sad that we're taking up this bill in this way, w/o single hearing on this bill so that people can raise issues.
The ideology: Get rid of taxes regardless. The regardless is the lives of many people that are at stake.
There's no golden eggs that come out of these tanning salons. To lose $600M because of this, really raises Qs about the recklessness.
I'm sure there are jobs involved w the tanning tax, but the basic issue is health. Evidence is clear: tanning can be a source of cancer.
Nothing is more important than one's health care. Nothing. And to minimize it is a mistake.
When it's said ACA is anecdotes - no it isn't. It's the lives of millions who have benefited from ACA.
ACA brought insurance to 20M ppl, the insurance rate went down dramatically. Ppl no longer have to fear illness bc they don't have insurance

Why markup this bill without an estimate from CBO? #PayMoreForLess
