Here in Rwanda. Training girls to tell their own story through journalism. Starting the #girleffect  http://t.co/gNniEiLr
When the Rwandan guide took me inside the church &amp; told story of those slaughtered inside I was speechless, all I could say was I'm so sorry
There are victims' shoes, rosary beads, pens, ID cards, pots &amp; pans. They thought they would be returning home.
Inside the church there are hundreds of skulls, leg arm &amp; hip bones. Bloodied clothes of the victims hang from the walls.
Instead 5 thousand Rwandans were slaughtered inside that church. When I walked inside I felt sick to my stomach.It's a memorial museum today
Today I went to a small Catholic church in Ntarama, 30 minutes outside Kigali, where Rwandans took refuge. They thought they were safe there
Clinton apologized for  the US not doing enough to stop the Rwandan genocide that left 800,000 dead &amp; 2 million refugees
It was 14 years to the day, March 26, 1998 I was last in Rwanda. I was w/President Clinton who apologized to the Rwandan people

The good news-24 hours later I've arrived in Kigali, Rwanda! The bad news-I can't say the same for my luggage. :)
March 26, 1998 Clinton apologized to Rwandan people for US not doing more to stop the genocide that left 800,000 +dead, 2 million refugees
We landed in Kigali, &amp; stayed for 3 hours on the Tarmac. For security reasons we never left the airport. Considered too dangerous.
Last time I was in Rwanda was on President Clinton's epic 11 day trip to Africa in March 1998.
First leg of journey 8 hour flight from ATL to Amsterdam ! Movies &amp; food !
So excited to be headed to Rwanda! A whole generation of genocide survivors now teens, many orphans, carving their own path w/out war.
Heading to Rwanda! Service project to teach Rwandan girls how to tell their own stories through journalism. A new generation of survivors!
