The military must know that they are subject to civil authorities in a democracy and that they are paid and equipped from tax payers' money.
The Nigerian military should be made to know its boundaries in a democracy by holding the very top in their hierarchy liable.
It is hoped that Niger state govt will have the heart to launch inquiry into these cold blooded killing of its people.
The govt which is tardy in response to extra judicial killings is sending a very wrong signal to the criminal elements within the society.
Injustice to one is injustice to all. Military vigilantism is as bad as terrorism. The govt's primary duty is to protect life.
When the Nigerian Army rampaged Zaria some closed their eyes to facts on ground and justified it. The NA has since moved on to Niger state.
