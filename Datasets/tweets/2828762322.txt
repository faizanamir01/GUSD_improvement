17. The White Sox are well represented at Cooperstown. Highly recommend visiting.	18. If you want to shake President Barack Obama’s hand, wear a Sox hat!
15. Giannis Antetokoumpo is THE greatest basketball player on the planet.	16. Coaching basketball is as much like 2K coach mode as driving is Mario Kart.
13. Franklin, Muskego, Big Bend, Vernon, and Mukwonago are wack. Road trips to Mukwonago for your sister’s coat she left are not fun.	14. Scott Walker getting bodied by a teacher is the sweetest poetic justice.
10. Wisconsin Badgers Football can disappoint.	11. Politicians pick their voters as easy as voters pick their politicians.	12. We’re all sleeping on the Mid-Atlantic Rap game.
7. Teaching children blackjack apparently “doesn’t set a good example.”	8. Racine is a pretty underrated city.	9. Wisconsin Badgers Basketball can disappoint.

The “laws are laws” philosophy is dangerous. It was illegal to free slaves and to harbor Jewish people during the holocaust, but it was still moral.
@ChuckTWeh @BryanSteilforWI Randy Bryce was 33, not that that matters, but fact check. Also the male brain is fully developed at the age of 25, meaning they were both relatively equal maturity wise. And the other 8 times were for things like peaceful protest and cannabis possession. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@ChuckTWeh @BryanSteilforWI “Have to check my facts and not let me exaggerate. Huh?” The drunk driving happened 20 years ago. I’m not excusing it, but it was a ages ago and he’s owned up to it. Besides, I don’t see you holding Schimel to the same standard.
