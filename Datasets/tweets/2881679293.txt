@fullhousemomma @NatashaFatah https://t.co/pDraWJ6RGy   This is how womens rights feels like.  They attack and attack.  Not all women are like this but a few are.
@fullhousemomma @NatashaFatah Ya I believe women should have the right to strip at clubs if they want.  Or they can have the right to live a Cinderella story if they want.
@fullhousemomma @NatashaFatah Whatever.  Assasination is an assasination.  If Pakistan started allowing strip clubs I wouldn’t care.  And I’m sure it would be profitable.
