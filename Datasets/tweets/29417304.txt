Where did the narrative of a red hat come from? It appears that someone has added this “red hat” piece to the story but sources close to Jussie say that never reported a red hat. 		Release the police report.

CPD suggested that the letter was a hoax. The FBI leaked that CPD got ahead of itself. Why would CPD comment on an investigation led by the FBI? 6/ https://t.co/bAsqF2yjOo

In all, it's been wild to watch people blindly repeat every little detail leaked from the Chicago Police Department as fact. I'm familiar with @AJGuglielmi because he once had the same PR role (and tactics) in Baltimore. We all deserve better. Jussie is the victim, here, FYI.
And this is a great example of the "reporting" that's been happening re: the leaks from the Chicago PD. When pressed, the reporter brazenly notes that he's just blindly repeating what he's told by the PD: https://t.co/1KPB3ln5lu
Recently, "sources" said that Jussie arrived home with the food he purchased from Subway in his hand as if to suggest that if he had really been attacked he would have immediately thrown away everything he had. C'mon. The attack was close to his condo, not miles away.
First, "sources" said that Jussie kept the rope around his neck to the hospital. Then "sources" later corrected the story to note that Jussie had the rope around his neck when he arrived back to his building when the police arrived. Why did the "sources" lie initially?
Then we learned that a woman in Jussie's condo bldg saw someone outside of the building in the timeframe &amp; reported this to the police. Then "sources" discounted *her* account by saying the description didn't match Jussie's description of the attackers.
Then "sources" said that Jussie couldn't have actually been hurt because he drove himself to the hospital. Later, "sources" cleaned that one up and noted that he was driven to the hospital by a friend *after* the police had interrogated him at his home.
Then "sources" loudly said that there was essentially no video of anything. But at the same time the "sources" said that, the police *had video* of Jussie in Subway, walking down the street, and had various other footage -- again, this was quietly reported.
Then "sources" said that Jussie didn't call 911 for 40 mins after the attack. Why don't we have the timestamps from the 911 call(s) yet? It is my understanding that the call was made immediately but that it took police 40 mins *to arrive*.
Then "sources" said that Jussie's ribs were broken, but neither the hospital nor Jussie's team ever said that his ribs were broken. But the "sources" made Jussie out to be a liar when he never said that in the first place. 3/
It was reported that "sources" w/in the Chicago PD said that Jussie refused to release his phone records. Then they quietly noted that he *never* refused to the phone records. He denied giving them his *phone.* They don't need his phone to access his phone records. 2/
THREAD. Why is the Chicago Police Department intentionally spreading misinformation about #JussieSmollett? Even if I didn't know him, I'd be concerned just about the way information has "leaked" via "sources" within the Chicago PD to reporters. And it's been since day one. 1/

I learned tonight that there are over 60,000 people who live in shelters in NYC.
I didn’t realize that the 2020 Census will be 80% online. And libraries are gearing up to prepare citizens to complete it, given that libraries often are the largest provider of free internet access.
The @BKLYNlibrary has a program called Telestory, a free program that supports kids &amp; families reading to a family member that is incarcerated. The library provides books for the parent &amp; kid so they can read together. 		You can find more info here: https://t.co/Snh38z7H7e
@miles_k @EricKlinenberg No, Nick Higgins, the lead of the Brooklyn Public Library.
Did you use a library in 2018? 		(I’m at a talk where it’s being said that more people access and use services at libraries than people assume.)
I’m at Knowledge For The People at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn w/ @krmaher who leads the Wikimedia Foundation &amp; Nick Higgins who is the Chief Librarian at the @BKLYNlibrary. And Dr. Ayana Johnson is the moderator. They’re incredible. https://t.co/J6UyhosacL

@nsilverberg And this is the person I’d engaged originally and where the tweet that has been deleted that I was referring to is. I apologize for the dismissiveness — I now realize you never saw the actual tweet that I called condescending because it was gone.  https://t.co/rv8WBOeB8Q
@TheBlackHoof @ismat And for context this is the person who I was talking to originally that also has the since deleted tweet: https://t.co/rv8WBOeB8Q
@TheBlackHoof @ismat I have reflected on it and could’ve engaged differently. And I should’ve watched more of the thread unfold before RT’ing people’s replies.
RT @vcunningham: i wrote about Hell. https://t.co/g0MVbkXrsP
@nsilverberg And there was a quote tweet where she literally said I was lying to everyone. And that is what I was referring to when I said it was condescending — I am open to disagreeing with people but I don’t call them liars.
@nsilverberg The convo began with this tweet. https://t.co/yQtBFJngTW

@caterinacqueso @nsilverberg What’s missing is the tweet where she says that I am lying — it looks like it’s been deleted. And it was this tweet from someone else that started the exchange. https://t.co/yQtBFJngTW
@TheBlackHoof @ismat And I said the condescension after she quote tweeted something I said and said that I was lying to all of my followers. I went back to just link to it but it looks like she deleted it.
@TheBlackHoof @ismat This started with this exchange. https://t.co/yQtBFJngTW
@ashure @nsilverberg What did you think she was saying?
@ismat I think we are saying the same thing. I was just noting that a FICO score is a distinct asset *and* that it is an input too — as you wrote, re: Equifax FICO.
@nsilverberg In the end, we were saying the *exact* same thing but I guess it was easier to make a thread to get RTs. A FICO score can stand alone because it is proprietary *and* it is used as an input in the credit bureaus like Equifax.
@nsilverberg And I wasn’t saying that it *wasn’t* based off of a credit report but that there is a distinct asset called a FICO score.
@nsilverberg I hate that this is what Twitter becomes. I was literally talking in my DMs with *another* woman expert who was an advocate and who I’ve been discussing this issue with which is how I was responding.

@ismat I was making a simple statement that you seem to be agreeing with now — that the FICO score is a distinct asset. (https://t.co/93BZSDbEiW). And that it is also an input.
We don’t talk enough about the repeal of the broadband privacy rules.
@ismat I don’t know if the condescension is intended or not but I’m bowing out here. I believe we likely have the same goals. Let me know if you have any sources you think important to share and I’ll continue connecting with the other advocates and experts.
@ismat I’ve been talking to advocates on this as well. Are you saying the FICO site is incorrect by noting that the FICO credit risk scores are made available to the credit agencies? https://t.co/ubhmwkTfuQ
@ismat No. A FICO score is a FICO score. And the credit bureaus use different inputs + a FICO score which is why they have different outputs.
