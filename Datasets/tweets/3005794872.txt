@lenzcrafterz @a_paul123 I'm a conservative, but I feel as though this was defended poorly. 1) It's not so much that the NFL doesn't represent the rest of the country; rather, they are an independent organization that can make its own rules. 2) Peaceful Protest is also a Constitutional Right.

@Walmart Furthermore, the condition of the tanks -- with the actual fish, not the tanks that are for sale -- I find their condition to be deplorable. Not only are they unclean, with dead fish frequently floating around, but also overstocked. One of the 2-3 gal. tanks had 8 cichlids.
@Walmart In regards to the overpriced issue: I actually found the opposite to be true. I bought a Febreze plug-in from Walmart only to find out the next weekend that I could have bought one from my local Target for two dollars less.
@4everNeverTrump Why don't you just move to North Korea, since you seem to think the leaders are so much more stable and sane there?
@treasonstickers Why don't all the people who didn't vote for Kim just move to North Korea since they think the leaders are so much more stable and sane there?
@OMGno2trump What do you mean 'abruptly' pulled out of the summit? He's been saying from the very beginning that he would do so if NOKO wasn't actually willing to have a productive talk about denuclearization. Also, if anything, this is taking attention away from #SpyGate
Well there you go -- our President knows what he's doing. https://t.co/aTpwCpPIWf
@specialkitty2me @SteveWestly Actually, it was 4 bankruptcies, and he was only using the law to his advantage so as to make money, like any good capitalist whose tired of government regulations would do.
@SteveWestly How was he willing to bend over for China? He actually took a pretty hard stance on trade against them -- not exactly what I would call pussyfooting around.
@PalmerReport Actually, it's Obama who begged Iran for peace. This president isn't going to waste his time begging; he's going to take a firm stance like a real leader!
@DrJillStein You do realize that the whole reason behind canceling the summit is that Kim wouldn't agree to any remote aspect of denuclearization, right?

@dena534 @MelanieGriffith It must be such a shock for you to realize after 20 years that NOKO is the real threat, not #ClimateChange
@cooter1310 @MelanieGriffith The latest congressional races would suggest otherwise...
@Drewl919 In which case tens of thousands -- minimally -- will have lost their lives before you're ready to do something about it.
@Drewl919 To sum it up, it doesn't actually qualify as a problem until Kim Jung-Un puts his finger on that big red button and sends that nuke to 🇺🇸
@Drewl919 Additionally, you're saying that past administrations have done nothing to prevent it from getting this far simply because... what?
@Drewl919 By saying we didn't want to attack 1st, you're implying that there is no problem until a war actually breaks out...
@Drewl919 NOKO has been plotting a bomb like this for two decades. The threat was identified during the Clinton era, yet remains unresolved. Why?
@Drewl919 So why, exactly, has this issue out-lived 3 presidents -- 24 years -- and gotten to the point where NOKO has become a nuclear power?
