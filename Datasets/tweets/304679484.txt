I've met countless children in hospitals over the years &amp; this little guy was one of the best! His name is Oscar.

FUN FACT: "Back To The Future" screenwriters Robert Zemeckis &amp; Bob Gale have both stated that Biff Tannen, played by the hilarious Tom Wilson (of Wing Commander fame) was, in part, based on our current "President".  #TrueStory #DonaldDrumpf https://t.co/2uVwmFIakm
@FasbinderTina From "Back To The Future".
Not EXACTLY what you pledged to do, Biff. You said MEXICO 🇲🇽 would pay for your wall. The citizens of our great Country were promised a #FreeWall- Remember? You promised it over 200+ times during your campaign. (It's on tape) 	#WhereAreThePesos? #PromisesMadePromisesIgnored https://t.co/DGxVQG5Gjg

Frasier is almost scary in its' perfection: brilliant scripts, expertly performed by a superb cast &amp; easily one of the best shows ever on television-I also consider it on par with comedies done in movies or on the Broadway stage.

In this 61-year-old TV show, a conman charlatan named Trump comes to town claiming only he can fix the people's problems by building a wall. Eeriely accurate in its' predictions. Will the last line comes true, too? "You're under arrest, Trump!" 🤞 https://t.co/fWBJd2yuSO

When I was born, my mom couldn't choose between 2 names she liked.

@Cudlitz @TheKidsABC @FlakedAndFormed @marycmccormack The feeling is mutual, Michael. I'm from a Catholic family with 7 kids &amp; I really appreciate your show's humor AND it's reality. My dad was a no-nonsense authoritarian Naval Officer &amp; you're just nailing him! You've done solid work for years, but this one's just a joy to watch.👍
@marycmccormack What's really cool is seeing you in a role that allows you to display your formidable talents. In just the 1st half-season, you have already entered the ranks of all-time greatest TV moms. Deep, multi-levelled, hilarious! A fan since Private Parts, mh ❤️

@realjackgore Let me fan-boy right back at you, Jack. Your show is the best new show I've seen in years.

@StayColdPonyboy I'm in the UK where it's morning already.
There were undoubtedly many, but I know Carrie had a real fondness for Dorothy Parker. She admired her writing &amp; her lifestyle. Fitting, as they both shared a mastery of language &amp; an acerbic wit. https://t.co/KvPNjuU6ql

@Manu_Pan86 @JohnWesleyShipp Worst. Doctor. EVER!
@JohnWesleyShipp @Manu_Pan86 You were hilarious in that episode! Seeing The Flash turning a goofy simpleton was more than just funnier than hell, it was both poignant &amp; astonishing. Always made me wish they'd let you do more comedy. 👍🤣 #PitchPerfect
@ThatChrisA Thanks, buddy. Seeing the behind-the-scenes shots always triggers memories I'd long forgotten. I recently watched the #ESB documentary shot in Norway &amp; details of that experience came flooding back like it happened yesterday. We had a blast, even shooting in blizzard weather!
I remember how much fun we had &amp; laughing a LOT! There were moments of self-awareness when the reality of grownups doing such absurd things kicked in- Working alongside one of the most acclaimed actors of all time next to a 9-ft furry dog-man wearing headphones, but no pants. https://t.co/QIPtQdcYck

What a great idea! This classic sitcom is as brilliant, smart &amp; funny as ever &amp; I can't think of a better birthday present for the #NationalTreasure that is Dick Van Dyke (btw, #HBD @iammrvandy 💖)-More importantly, it is our duty to perpetuate his legacy for future generations! https://t.co/zJHFWJP5px

I mention keeping my #StarWars opinions to myself &amp; what happens? It triggers an avalanche of questions about the next one! All can is yes, I'm in it. Other than that, just consider it: EPISODE NEIN COMMENT.
@wlsalyers Thanks, Bill! High praise indeed from one of the finest actors in VO.
Months before that episode aired a #BatmanTAS sound-mixer asked me if I had asked for a raise in salary. Me: No. Why do you ask? Him: Because I'm working on a Joker show right now &amp; that sure ain't YOU!🤣 Michael's version (drawn Dick Sprang-style) is perfection! 🃏 #TopsInTaps https://t.co/YYD5gdzbwd

@Svengoolie Lump in my throat almost made me cry when I spoke. It was French restaurant &amp; knowing I was riveted on him-he did his Groucho slouch-walk going to rest rooms-disappeared then popped his head around the corner"What is it? Madams or Mezziers? I can't make heads or tails out of it!"
