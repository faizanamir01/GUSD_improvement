@fishsports I really don’t understand the issue. Witten’s value is 1) as a mentor to a room of raw TEs and 2) as a consistent technician in the run game. Expecting him to be the primary receiving threat in the middle is absurd, that’s (presumably) Jarwin role.

@rossrandow52 @KevinRLangford @theconcon1012 Rosen will take the NFL by storm, a Rodgers 2.0 if he’s with the right team. Jackson will have a VY type rookie year, but there is risk of a VY or RGIII career.

@theconcon1012 @rossrandow52 @KevinRLangford I thought about that each of the first 3 rounds but I just don’t think they believe they need help at safety, and (aside from the possibility of an impact FS like Earl Thomas) I don’t think it would make much of a difference for this team.

@VoiceOfTheStar A lot of beat writers seem to be mad and looking for anything they can to criticize, even making mountains out of molehills.		For me, it’s hurting their credibility.
@rjochoa That’s not good
@Marcus_Mosher He doesn’t have to be good if he can succeed in a specific role, ala Beasley.		At least Thompson is a DIFFERENT kind of player from what DC currently has. So I’m willing to give him a chance b/c I’d rather risk $1M on that than $20M+ on a FA WRs whose team didn’t want them
