@AnnaApp91838450 @BreitbartNews Sadly, wealthy Jews are in charge of the hate-America campaign.  Maher, Rubin, Steyer, Schumer, Bloomberg, Zucker, Behar, Goldberg, Streisand, Midler, Reiner, Sulzberger to name a few.  They even hate tiny Israel, a country surrounded by haters.
@BreitbartNews ...and CNN wonders why they are hated?
@RealSaavedra There are racists - Don Lemon comes to mind.
@GKeile Democrats hate the greatness, freedom and liberty of the USA.  Unless they are stopped, the USA will be a socialist swamp within one generation.
@theJeremyVine @Jamelia A big time bigot.  She cares not that Democrats fund public employee unions knowing they will be dead when the bill comes due.  Democrats = whores for votes.

Seeing a man, Kavanaugh, accused of 36 year old bogus charges was sickening.  No evidence — no witnesses.  Not ONE Democrat stood and said, “Wait, this is not America.”  They joined in lockstep to destroy a man for political gain.

With hysterical rage, women are using Kavanaugh for any pent up rage they feel toward men.  Even though Kavanaugh received rave reviews by 65 women who have 1st hand knowledge of his support and integrity.	The left is on total destruction mode.
Where are all the men?  I have watched a decent man publicly excoriated for a 35 year old allegation with zero evidence or corroboration.  Women have gone ballistic in their zeal against his Kavanaugh appointment to the Supreme Court.

@RealSaavedra @SandraTXAS Make certain the ‘not more than’ is ironclad.
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews Dr. Ford needs help.  I hope she uses the money from GoFundMe to be an inpatient where she can be treated.  What 61 year old talks baby talk, makes accusations that cannot be substantiated 35 years after the fact, and has a memory like a sieve?  She is being used.

@jcs2 @sallykohn @AnaMariaArchil2 Dr. Ford has my sympathy.  She was a sad witness.  She talked like a small girl in baby talk, couldn’t remember dates, places, etc.  I believe Democrats exploited her obvious issues.  None of her alleged witnesses confirm her story.  Political theater at its worst.
@sallykohn @AnaMariaArchil2 I am beginning to believe American Jews have a genetic predisposition to being leftist loons.  They hate everything wonderful America stands for.

GOP Has A Choice: Confirm Kavanaugh, Or Get Slaughtered In November https://t.co/BRZYiGxWZ9
There is an irony - a blight on humankind was Hitler’s assassinations of Jews.  Today we have Jews (Feinstein &amp; Schumer, et. al.), assassinating Brett Kavanaugh - because he is conservative.  This is equally evil.
@Deplorable_JJ_ @brithume @awstar11 Payback for Garland?  Remember their Clarence Thomas witch hunt?  This is their standard operating procedure.  Republicans - they overwhelmingly voted for Ginsberg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  One side plays fair, the Democrats shoot to kill.
@JedediahBila @RonanFarrow Lowest standards?  Absolutely NO standards.
@Aikens_Josh This is the worst of human behavior as demonstrated by Avanetti.  The Bar Assocation allows pulling this crap out of thin air?  Lawyers have no standards of behavior if this is okay.
@WayneDupreeShow Call Democrats out for their dirty despicable behavior.  They do not have ONE honorable Senator who smells a rat. I feel dirty just thinking about the policy of personal destruction being waged by Democrats.  Vote Red!
Notice that not ONE Democrat Senator has called foul on this 35 year old, made up stench of a witch hunt.  Not ONE with a shred on honor or integrity. Democrats are evil (and sadly, I was one).
