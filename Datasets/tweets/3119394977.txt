When you don't have facts to support your arguments (present logical reasoning), you must resort to the above tactics.	The NARRATIVE is designed to keep people in a constant state of 'FEAR' thereby forcing 'ANGER', 'RAGE', 'VIOLENCE'.

Ask yourself, why are 'Liberals' always angry?	Why do they curse?	Why do they slander (push fake labels &gt; racist, sexist, …ist etc.)?
