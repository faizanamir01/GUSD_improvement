White supremacy is referring to the racist behavior of white teenage boys at elite private schools as understandable while also referring to the killing of a black 12 year old boy for playing with a toy gun by police as understandable.
TRUST ME: If after experiencing racism at work, school, church, etc., we could just “walk it off,” we would!

Conservatives tend to respond to fear more strongly than liberals do, according to a neuroscientist.		“The one main cognitive difference is that conservatives are more sensitive to threat. Their fears are sometimes exaggerated. I think they fear her.”  https://t.co/bJDSScwxoy
@AsteadWesley Racially tinged, I think, is when just the crust is racist.

Most Americans, in a poll conducted last July, said that they believed Trump had emboldened racists to voice their opinions. Has Rep. Steve King been more willing to bring his views out of the shadows because Trump creates the space for him to do so? https://t.co/8ndWWAhgxB
