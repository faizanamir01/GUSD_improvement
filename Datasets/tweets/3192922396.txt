There's a hole in the leadership of our middle of the political spectrum-44% of us are now self-described Independents and/or Moderates. The RNC &amp; DNC are controlled by their fringes.
The economic proposals coming out of DC All lack rigor &amp; historical experience. But no society is healthy with a declining middle class, it was one of our great accomplishment. But not since the Gilded Age, have we been in this boat. But poor answers aren't the answer.
Wealth taxes have been repealed in ALL of the Nordic County's &amp; 70% tax in France which now has the highest unemployment of any major European economy. There's a hole in the leadership of our middle of the political spectrum-40% of us are now self-described Independents Moderates
