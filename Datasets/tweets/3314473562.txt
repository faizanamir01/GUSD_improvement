Además de todo esto, están considerando ponerlo en la competencia. Es increíble tanta desvergüenza.
Su discurso político, tiene el poder de presentar sólo ambición monetaria. Su camuflaje, la manipulación , el resentimiento, el plagio desvergonzado para ganar liderazgo, la demagogia, la abyección y la imposición, cómo herencia exquisita de vulgaridad.
Eres único en tu poder inminente de camuflaje e hipocresía. Quedará impune otra política falsa que tapa la falta de carácter y liderazgo. No verás ni un solo dólar que no trabajaste.
