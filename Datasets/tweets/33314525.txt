@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Also my information comes from wikipedia as well. Perhaps you don't ask the right questions or maybe you don't read as obsessively as I do. I have heard D'Souza's lectures however I did not just take his word or the word of any left bias organization I look up facts.
@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon I still don't understand what facts support your theory that there was a switch. So reading up on the past administrations and fact checking is why I don't believe there was ever a switch. Democrats raised me but once I researched I was surprised at the myths believed by them.
@indigocrosley @Hatchay @MattAboutMovies @CW4Dave @macdaddymeemz @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon I could be wrong but I believe it's a reference to pimps and traffickers.
@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Let's get this straight I did not get the info from him although I have heard his lectures. I actually looked up the info on the past acts and administrations. So why you continue to bash him instead citing facts as I did is beyond me.
@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Also Dems do exploit minorities.  Even today. My favorite in the last decade is on voter i.d.. Suggesting that it is difficult for some to obtain an i.d.. Ridiculous.
@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon You do realize he is a historian himself. And facts actually back up what he says. So keep your blinders on. See how that works out.
@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon A little more facts for your scholars. https://t.co/CjUJPHtotF
@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Perhaps they need to find a new job. Because the facts do not support this drivel. When Nixon took office 80% African Americans attended an all black school when he left it was 8%. Facts like these do not support their claims. They must spin it or their party would of died out.

@DudeHazard @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Most people do not know history of the parties well or at all.
@indigocrosley @CW4Dave @macdaddymeemz @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Personally I prefer men in roles meant for men. I wouldn't pay for a ticket to watch a woman Romeo, but hey that's just me. I just don't think watching a woman being lifted by another woman in ballet or ballroom will have the same affect for appreciation of the dance.
@macdaddymeemz @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Sure did. Good luck to you. I think we are done here.
@macdaddymeemz @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon The comment suggest so. Calling it rigid and where men drag women around tells me perhaps they are not fan of it.
@indigocrosley @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon This still makes no sense. I can not debate this any longer if your argument is a dance is designed to keep women silent and obedient. It's artful expression of a man and woman. Meant to be enjoyed. Not domineering.

@AOC 🤣🤣🤣 Truth hurts sometimes. You will be okay. 🤣🤣🤣
@AertkerMichelle @dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Your very welcome
@AOC Showing your intellect again. It is nothing to do with the dancing. I weep for future generations when I hear their logic or their lack of.
@dietotaku @ramzpaul @AOC @MyassesDragon Actually in this type of dance the man is to help display the beauty of the woman in the dance. He leads her, twirls her, dips, and catches her. Sad you cannot see the beauty of ballroom dancing.

@Newsweek Former top CIA Officer? Did I miss a step? Your Headline is misleading. He worked for Obama but he was not a CIA officer? Russia accused him of being a CIA agent. So was he? Perhaps I am to tired and just misread.
@TomasitxDolore @YallRCrazy @PressSec So.....we are changing the subject?
@TomasitxDolore @YallRCrazy @PressSec When was I hateful? Perhaps I can clarify. My intention is not hateful.
@beee_cause @YallRCrazy @PressSec Because he should of gave up the mic. Then it would not of been a problem.  He blocked her twice then forcefully holds on to the mic when she finally grabs it and drops his arm to which he excused himself. He should of handed it over. She wasn't hurt. It was just disrespectful.
@ConcernedFruit @YallRCrazy @PressSec Hush now? Why would you say that? Because my words just aren't important as yours? Then why even respond to what I say? I do not appreciate being hushed. You are condescending.
@Dnttrsttrump @LGHLUglyTruth @m_t_dwyer @PrisonPlanet @TheJokerSoap So by that logic. Two wrongs make a right? I respectfully disagree.
Why didn't they show the clip of when she was trying to take the mic? I have not watched the entire segment.  Did they ever show it? https://t.co/H8e7FVPUmt
@Dnttrsttrump @LGHLUglyTruth @m_t_dwyer @PrisonPlanet @TheJokerSoap He said next to other reporters and they gave up the mic once the intern went for it.
@Dnttrsttrump @LGHLUglyTruth @m_t_dwyer @PrisonPlanet @TheJokerSoap Not about what Potus did. It's about what Jim did. I tell my children all the time you are responsible for your actions not others. It doesn't matter what someone does to you it matters how you respond. It is called accountability.
@ChupieIva @YallRCrazy @PressSec If this was his first offense perhaps they would not of pulled him.  He was disrespectful to the procedure several times before this.
@ConcernedFruit @YallRCrazy @PressSec She doesn't have to ask. She is suppose to take it. She tried twice to take it from him one way and since that was being blocked she reached around where he again stopped her excused himself then she stepped away and knelt. She did nothing wrong.
@ChupieIva @YallRCrazy @PressSec When did I lie?
@TomasitxDolore @YallRCrazy @PressSec My favorite is Ben Shapiro.  I agree with him when he says facts don't care about your feelings. And I am old enough to remember what is taught today was not what I learned when I was in school. I cannot learn if I take from only one narrative. So I research. To better myself.
@Lucky_Justdrew @YallRCrazy @PressSec I never accused him of such. However if you look up the definition something as simple as spitting on someone is assault. It is a board generalization. But can technically be use by WH. My point is he was wrong.
@montrbeach @YallRCrazy @PressSec Yes. I watch several news outlets to be well informed. CNN, FOX, MSNBC, ABC, and many others. Because I can then form an unbiased opinion. I watched the live feed on this conference.  So what lie did I tell?
@ChrisGs76 @YallRCrazy @PressSec I saw it live
@Cheekyone45 @YallRCrazy @PressSec No. I seen it live. And seen many different camera angles after. It's not about a side. It's about respect and following the procedure in place so other reporters have a turn. He disregarded and disrespected that.
@EmMadashell @YallRCrazy @PressSec It is not a lie. It is a fact that she was to take the mic from the reporters and pass it to the next called on reporter. Jim knew that and not only ignored it but refused to give it up by blocking her. He was wrong.
@beee_cause @YallRCrazy @PressSec No she grabbed the mic as she is suppose to it was her job.
@ChupieIva @YallRCrazy @PressSec She was touching the mic. Again that was her job responsibility.
@jana_spaulding @PressSec She reached for the mic twice the third time he stopped her where he had only been blocking twice before. How did she assault him?
@jana_spaulding @PressSec He already asked 2 questions. She was doing what she was suppose to. It was her responsibility to take the mic and pass it on. Jim Acosta knows that. He was in the wrong.
@YallRCrazy @PressSec I saw it live feed this is what happened.
@Dnttrsttrump @LGHLUglyTruth @m_t_dwyer @PrisonPlanet @TheJokerSoap Therefore he was wrong.  He knows he was wrong. President Trump has answered back even when he has moved on from Jim. But that still isn't good enough for Jim or his followers.
@Dnttrsttrump @LGHLUglyTruth @m_t_dwyer @PrisonPlanet @TheJokerSoap She took the mic from several reporters because she was suppose to and she was doing so quickly so there was not a long pause or wait for the next question. She was doing what she was suppose to do. Jim knew this he had already been given 2 questions when most only receive one.
@Dnttrsttrump @LGHLUglyTruth @m_t_dwyer @PrisonPlanet @TheJokerSoap She has authority over the mic.
@starrizborn @MSNBC @Montejp231 He already asked 2 questions. She was doing her job and he was not respectful of her or the other reporters who had questions in the room. POTUS had every right to reprimand him especially since this is not the first time he disregarded the process.
@fivo666 @HuffPost You mean the one that was closer to him so he could hear him better? Plus he spoke up and was not sounding timid. Really on to something huh? 🙄
@HuffPost This is ridiculous. My hearing is not what it once was and I ask people repeatedly to repeat themselves especially if they have a thick accent because I don't fully understand when I am only hearing pieces of what is said.

Love house sitting when it includes a pool! ;)
Water guns and pool made a fun afternoon. Looking forward to some fun in the sun tomorrow. Now time to get my little Silly Millie to bed.
I'm thinking pool side is the place to be this weekend due to the expected heat wave.
First time on twitter. Just seeing what everyone is talking about.
