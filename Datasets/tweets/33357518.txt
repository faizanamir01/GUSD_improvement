@LourdesBarbaraF @9l8f @Montel_Williams @dbongino @MollyJongFast I guarantee he might be of ITALIAN decent but he is not actually ITALIAN.  I have an Italian passport(thru marriage)which makes me more ITALIAN than Oingo Boingo and I am American of Swedish/German decent.  Southern Italy/Sicily/Sardegna is actually very close to Africa btw.

@Mikekincaid57 A life sentence is gentle.  He walked around looking for more victims and traveled specifically to kill and scare black men.  He ran up on him and stabbed him from behind like a coward.   Suddenly, he is sorry? GTFO.   Wait until he gets to Riker’s.

@DaenerysStrong @realDonaldTrump @SenatorBurr must be the #evelynwood of Senators. To read, with comprehension, 2 MILLION pages of legal documents? While a sitting Senator?

@webster Let me get this straight:  they are in fear of Ms. Omar so they go to her turf and traipse around claiming to have proof she is out to behead them told to GTFO by star Tribune so instead resort to hanging out in hipster coffe shops because their hotspots don’t work in the MSP?

@realDonaldTrFan You are so right.  While the could be getting something done, you wasted 14 minutes of their time, 10 of which was probably loading candy over their heads like a 3rd grade bully does.   Why don’t you ask Barron to teach you Fortnite and leave governing to grown folks.

However, given the subject, a certain Chief Stew does in fact, think extremely highly of herself.  How often do you remind others of your job title? Me, never.
@messykat @Bravotv @capthlr @Kate_Chastain Also, my staffs never speak to me in any way but respectful, not because I demand it, but because I earn it and treat them as I wish to be treated.  Win/Win.
@JMKulski @StefanyLaBoss @Julespesci @Bravotv @capthlr @Kate_Chastain @kate @ms Wait, so you read the terms and conditions of her employment contract?  There usually is specific legal language under maritime law regarding dismissal processes.  If not, why not just throw her overboard?

@Flutterflash @ggqt3 @McDonalds They can upgrade the charges but at booking, that was enough to hold him.
@AngelaBWhite1 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I guarantee his impairment (most likely alcohol and drugs) escalated his irrational reaction.  And she, fortunately, was able to defend herself.  He then assaulted 2 others.
@Ford89234211 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds And you replied without unrolling the entire thread.  Out of context, I can see where you based your thoughts.  Witness reported he began screaming before approaching the counter.  It was escalating, rapidly.  He had no right to touch her.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @ctbballfan @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds You really should get that stick out of your ass.  It’s gotta hurt.
@acturagenoturs_ @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I agree but he was definitely impaired in some way.  In his mugshot his eyes are dilated which is usually consistent w substance abuse.  Over a straw.  It’s mind boggling.
@NotThatType_Dr @thisisnotr0z3 @babaWAsherlin @tariqnasheed He tells the manager he wants his food, so he looks at the ticket and walks out of frame.  Customers had already called 911.  He walked away, then came back and attacked the manager while they waited for PD to arrive.
@lanafur Wrong thread, sorry! That was part of a broader conversation that was more about dealing with people who are mentally ill or impaired. He was definitely impaired.  Stable people don’t go so crazy over a straw.  She’s💯 justified in defending herself. 2 addition ppl were attacked.

@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds 💯 agree w you on that.  I am grateful for everyone that law enforcement was able to arrest and charge him.  There are also additional victims.  Hopefully the charges will be upgraded.

@Ford89234211 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I did not imply that.  You assumed that.  I live near a halfway house for mentally ill people, I see them everyday and quite often befriend them.  I also deal with people under the influence of drugs and hooch every day of my life.Normal, stable people don’t lose it over a straw.
@Nunya_bzznass @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Clearly you don’t understand de-escalating a situation.  She had every right to defend herself, which she did quite well.  This episode continued where he attacked the manager and another employee as well.  He was clearly impaired.  His mugshot screams crackhead.
@acturagenoturs_ @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one is justifying his actions.  He is in jail and attacked two more people.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @PaulDSmith9 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds He attacked the Manager too.
@AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Also, I didn’t imply, you assumed.  And we know what happens when people assume.
@AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I specifically said “I concur.  However,when dealing with mentally unstable people, the goal is to manage the risk of further public danger”.   Don’t use quotes if you don’t know how.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I do not disagree with you.  Does a normal, unimpaired person usually resort to assault when requesting additional drinking straws?
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds But I agree, he was definitely impaired.  It was the day after his big 40 and he got beat up by a small woman at McDonalds, arrested and charged with multiple counts of battery for attacking others.  Mugshot looks like meth head. I concur.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds And by the way, it was battery.
@EleanorOfAquit6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Who exactly is giving him a pass?  He committed a series of crimes and as a result is now in jail, rightfully so.
@ctbballfan @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Nice language Gramps. All employees do receive customer service training and how to avoid conflict.  I don’t think any reasonable person could have seen a reaction that crazy to a drinking straw request.  She certainly was better prepared to handle him than most, for sure.
@OCLonghorn @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds And he is overdrawn at the commissary at Pinellas County jail.....
@bdonahueweedman @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one said that.  #capslockchill
@tamjak @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Well, I don’t know where you live but where I live, stable people don’t go batshitcrazy and batter multiple folks for a drinking straw.
@TheBrofucius @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I never heard anything about race.  He is an equal opportunity batterer as he attacked the Manager and another employee.
@JALady36 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I specifically said either mentally ill/otherwise impaired, which if in his mugshot, you can see glassed over, dialated pupils indicative signs of substance abuse. Normal people to not unhinge and become aggressive and violent when requesting drinking straws.
@AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I certainly don’t question anyone’s actions, except Daniel Willis Taylor’s.
@antitrumpresist @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds If you read his intake sheet, it seems he has been stabbed before (scar on ribs).  He attacked two others too.  She was 💯justified, not to mention his head is probably still throbbing.
@TallGirl6262 @tariqnasheed That tat tho
@TallGirl6262 @tariqnasheed Rib, appendix, lesbian symbol.   Probably has been stabbed.
@LeishaFoyDooley @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds @mcdonald Also Manager was attacked as was another employee.  Charges are likely to be upgraded.
@LeishaFoyDooley @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds @mcdonald https://t.co/bdWr77BcZs. Please cite your sources regarding firing.   McDonald’s statement regarding incident says otherwise.
@AngelaBWhite1 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds In what society is it “normal” to batter  multiple people over a straw?  She was actually “battered” as were others, of other races.  He is an equal opportunity bully.  He is also criminal and most likely an addict.  Congratulations on all your education🍾📚📓!
@AngelaBWhite1 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds https://t.co/bdWr77BcZs	 Note dialated pupils. Definitely a sign of meth/cocaine/substance abuse.  I’m state certified in alcohol/substance abuse.  I’m 💯 percent team #Yasmine 💯 grateful he was arrested and is overdrawn at jail commissary.

Closing a restaurant that employs,  most likely 50 ppl, who have families to feed, is not the solution.  It causes greater harm, even to those who were not even there.  He was jailed and is awaiting trial multi charges.
@whatinoticed @jamestsmom @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Yes, I did.  But was it a rhetorical question mark?
@thisisnotr0z3 @NotThatType_Dr @babaWAsherlin @tariqnasheed He didn’t refund it.  He was “refilling” it but basically stall tactic.  I wonder if they have straws in Pinellas county jail.🤔
@ItllBeAiight @the79show @AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds They were called as situation escalated. This was about a STRAW.  He’s in jail now.
@reensjp @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one disputes this, anywhere.
@NotThatType_Dr @babaWAsherlin @tariqnasheed Customers called 911 immediately and they were attempting to keep him there until police arrived.  He’s in jail now.
@Dougbranch6 @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds I agree 💯.  But a stable person doesn’t lose their mind over a straw.  Now he’s in jail.
@ItllBeAiight @the79show @AuntieKarla @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds One is not like the other.   He attacked the white, male manager.  There were many911 calls on this incident and you saw less than 1 minute of a much longer incident.  A stable person doesn’t get Batshit nuts over a straw, regardless of race.

@PassTheSalty @McDonalds Some states are going green, not using plastic straws. Some fast food chains give you one, others have them at soft drink station.  Regardless, he wasn’t accepting of her response.
@patrickesnyder @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Where exactly did this become about race? It was a straw issue.   I only heard him call her a bitch. After she defended herself vigorously and valiantly.  He’s the only bitch I heard.  Day after 40th, homeless, crazy, ass kicked by a woman and in jail.  #patheticexcuseforaman
@StarredBannet @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds So you need to make this about race? Let’s go with human than, shall we? Wrong is wrong.  His actions are indefensible, regardless.  Hers, admirable, again, regardless. No one had the right to touch her.
@justicedawning @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Manager’s manage.  Thats why they are called Managers.  They manage employees, situations  and also train staff how to respond to potential contentious situations.

Sometimes pointing out the obvious isn’t so obvious. #duh
@WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds Sir, he is a homeless transient, being held for provisional extradition.  His behavior is indicative of a meth head.   No one goes that crazy over a straw.   McDonald’s is pretty generous with their straws.  I have 50 in my car.
@kdivies1 @PassTheSalty @McDonalds She took the order in front of him. It was paid for.  Then he went apeshit over a straw then he battered her.

@justicedawning @WJSchnebly @PassTheSalty @McDonalds No one is arguing that she had every right to defend herself.  He had no right to touch her, under any circumstances so don’t @ me on this.   My concern is for her and her alone.

@kdivies1 @PassTheSalty @McDonalds He’s already locked up.  He has a restraining order and charges pressed.  Why should they close a restaurant down because of a mentally unhinged man?  Those employees count on those jobs to feed their families, closing would hurt more people  than the original battery victim.
@PassTheSalty @McDonalds Chances are, he is mentally ill or an addict.   Hopefully they have straws at the Pinellas County lock up.

@BdIdeaFairy @MuhammadLila @JustinTrudeau If the shoe fits, wear it. I am worried about what is going on in WI right now.  I don’t need a tired Dom to tell me what to do.  I asked a genuine ?, got snark in return.   Don’t let the door hit ya.
@BdIdeaFairy @MuhammadLila @JustinTrudeau Sorry, I showed interest and concern to your “plight”and  I was looking for your POV and insight.  People like you are great at sitting back with your smug sense of superiority while people like me actually try to do something.  #haveaseatbitch
@BdIdeaFairy @MuhammadLila @JustinTrudeau Sincerely, how would you suggest going about this?  Are there Tribal records of names and is this truly disappearance or did they leave voluntarily?  Please start a new thread to bring this to light.  It’s important to more people than you know.

@CBPSanDiego @retrosher In all fairness; the CBP officers were very professional and nice.   There is no way they would flinch at 500 extra people.  Especially on a holiday weekend.  It’s expected.
@CBPSanDiego @retrosher Can you explain exactly where at the border the footage/mass invasion is taking place?   I have crossed there often and “once” on a holiday weekend.  There were 1,000’s of people in line on foot and in cars.  We walked the border on the Mexican side and I don’t recall this area
@EpochTimes I would love to know exactly where this is at San Ysidro because it looks nothing like the border I cross often.
@anylaurie16 Anyone who has ever crossed at San Ysidro knows that what is showing on @CNN is what it normally looks like.  One Memorial Day we waited hours amongst 1,0000’s to come home from a day trip to TJ.  But suddenly 500 is a mass invasion?

@stucam7771 Define what “almost” means in Scotland.  In US we use the term “full blown” meaning total and complete.
@JoEbi21 @ggqt3 @CharacterMatte @Chipotle I deal w public, We have policies. I follow them.  Advice to @chipotle St. Paul staff would’ve been:follow procedure, prevent incident, have 911 ready, should it escalate.  Taking matters into own hands vs company policy is what lost her job.  Finis.
@SassyKadiK The “floor” of the forest votes nope, afraid a good hard “raking” is anything term for “raping”.

@cherokeesher2 @Mikekincaid57 I have said this 1 billion times.......
@ggqt3 @JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @Chipotle It’s never okay.   I work w/ multi millionaire pro athletes(multi-culti) as private concierge because some have been asked for cc up front to host a team dinner, buy bottles, luxury services.  But poor little church mouse me, it’s “whatever you want” and I dictate payment terms
@JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @ggqt3 @Chipotle Also, it isn’t about winning.  I only debate for sake of enlightenment.  This isn’t a war and I did reread and weigh, with objectivity, your POV.   Disagreement and respect are not mutually exclusive.
@JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @ggqt3 @Chipotle I did look perspective.  3 years ago dude arrested for something. 3 years ago he+his jackass friends tweeted re: juvenile, illegal stunt that may or may not have gone down. Regardless, pre judging person,  imposing a different set of standards for them is predudicial at minimum.
.@NYPDONeill .@NYPDDetectives .@nypost  8/23/18 8:15am,153rd &amp; Archer he  ambushed woman, punched in face @ Courthouse, next to NYPD CSI bldg-on NYPD video,still at large. Victim broke back on fall. Suffered severe emotional, physical injuries.  @Twitter  do your thing: https://t.co/yyucc7RO8y
@CharacterMatte @JoEbi21 @ggqt3 1 individual was charged +convicted w misdemeanor in 2015.  What was it for specifically?  Is it def related? 	Does @chipotle have pay before prep policy or was it only to these individuals?  They prep my food, miserly, I might add, w/out oprepayment before I quit patronizing.
@JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @ggqt3 Thank god for your mad detective skills, still doesn’t change fact the employees took matters into their own hands.  Do I agree w them crying wolf?  No. Seems he was arrested and went thru the legal system.  If they’re stupid enough to do it again they deserve proscecution.
@JoEbi21 @CharacterMatte @ggqt3 Haven’t had opportunity to do a thorough background check on all parties, however, @Chipotle doesn’t have a “pay before your order is made” policy.  If they did, I would refuse cuz skimpy protein portions. Employees escalated. If they didn’t pay, there are legal ramifications.

@CindyinSmoke @blueyedproducer @ian_mcmeanan @PractialMagic @SophiaPicIt @norgedane @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS So my number, 60 since May is actually spot on.  A legal background does wonders for presenting facts.
@blueyedproducer @CindyinSmoke @ian_mcmeanan @PractialMagic @SophiaPicIt @norgedane @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS So I am tall, thin and blonde, right?   Pro tip: read and substantiate your facts before presenting them.   Your tweet cred is nil.
@blueyedproducer @ian_mcmeanan @PractialMagic @SophiaPicIt @norgedane @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS For sake of debate clarify: 8,000 indictments x 7.60 month = 60,800.

@blueyedproducer @ian_mcmeanan @PractialMagic @SophiaPicIt @norgedane @JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS Fed indictments are not state, but by district courts that vary..  A “state’s” sealed indictments are specific  to that state, by state’s AG. 61,000 sealed  indictments require 11,960 per “state” based on 50 states + DC.
