My current fiance now wanta to break up after 7 months because I'm too nice to her, her previous hubby of 25 yrs was mean &amp; nasty to her &amp; died of colon cancer just when she was about to divorce him, now i get the shaft of his evil meanness, they say they want a nice man, really?
I'm a nice guy who respects women, and gets left in the dirt, my wife ran off with a Bad boy criminal, that she thought she could tame with her love and he would respect her afterwards, all he did was lead her astray and used her for her job and money for 10 yrs.. https://t.co/FwUotT2Z1z
