That’s why at Human Rights First, we’re focused on the FACTS. We’re focusing on representing and advocating for those who are forced to leave their homes behind in search of safety.		And during tonight’s #SOTU, we’ll be thinking of their stories. /END
These are the true stories of many of the men, women, and children who arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking their legal right to safety.		But President Trump would rather scapegoat them to advance his anti-immigrant agenda.
Lucas* and Eduardo*—eight and four years old—arrived in the United States desperate to escape from their abusive father. Two weeks after their interview with the asylum officer, the boys were granted asylum. 		They celebrated by eating ice cream sundaes.
Cristian* is a gay man from El Salvador who endured years of abuse and persecution due to his sexual orientation before escaping to the United States. 		Now that he has been granted asylum, he no longer fears for his safety because of his identity. https://t.co/JmU5YDv6oD
Miranda* fled decades of domestic violence at the hands of her husband in Mexico. She complained to Mexican authorities on multiple occasions, but they failed to protect her. 		She traveled to the U.S. border with only one hope: that the United States would protect her.
👏👏👏 https://t.co/cmP1yoXCXg
Natalia* fled her native Honduras after testifying against the gang members who murdered a family member and narrowly escaping being killed herself. With the help of a pro bono legal team, she was recently granted asylum and can finally live in safety with her children. https://t.co/VbR9D4QwaH
Jennifer* and Carlos* are 12-year-old and 6-year-old siblings who fled El Salvador after their mother assisted law enforcement officers in the investigation of their father’s disappearance and murder.		 The asylum process was their lifeline; it was a lifesaver.
Juan* is a 15-year-old boy who escaped abuse and exploitation at the hands of his extended family in El Salvador and threats from local gang members. 		Here in the United States, he can concentrate on his studies without fearing every day for his safety. https://t.co/4nWwnJ3V36
Our client Gabriela* is a female attorney from El Salvador who escaped death threats from MS-13 after refusing to provide them with legal assistance. 		Now that she has been granted asylum, Gabriela is committed to using her legal skills to assist other survivors of violence.
He calls asylum seekers “criminals”—but they often escaped criminals.	He calls them “illegals”—but seeking asylum is LEGAL.	He calls them “freeloaders”—but they ask only for freedom.
Tonight during his #SOTU, President Trump will try to scare Americans into supporting his cruel agenda by saying awful, untrue things about refugees and asylum seekers. 		We work with refugees every single day. We know the truth. THREAD/

The Trump Administration’s massive overuse of detention punishes vulnerable asylum seekers in a failed attempt to deter others from seeking protection. Refugee families are treated like criminals from the moment they arrive at our borders. 	https://t.co/ky6J0ibnsN
These detention centers are prisons. Detainees are subjected to unhygienic, unsanitary, and unsafe conditions. And they are often mistreated and discriminated against by facility staff. 		"It's torture, it is not life. People who ask for asylum are treated like criminals here."
LGBT individuals are 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than non-LGBT people in immigration detention. 		Alicia, a 29-year-old transgender women experienced transphobic slurs, abuse, and a complete lack of protection while detained in the male housing unit.
Detention facilities are especially unable or unsuited to provide adequate care for vulnerable populations, including pregnant women and members of the LGBT community. 		Conditions in DHS facilities put the health of pregnant women at risk—with many suffering miscarriages.
No one deserves to be treated this way.		▪️A hearing-impaired asylum seeker waited over six months for a working hearing aid.	▪️A woman hemorrhaged for over two months before receiving emergency care. 	▪️A diabetic man was forced to wait 11 days for his medication.
One tragic example:		Irena, a 50-year-old Armenian woman, experienced severe stomach pain and swelling that often caused her to vomit. Medical staff misdiagnosed her with liver problems. Upon release, a doctor discovered that she had ovarian cancer. 	https://t.co/ky6J0ibnsN
Health care in immigration detention in California is entirely insufficient. 		Long delays before being attended to by staff and health professional, insufficient medication, and a lack of appropriate mental health care for survivors of torture and trauma are all too common.
ICE continues to deny asylum seekers release on parole—despite our lawsuit blocking the blanket denial of parole requests.		Our research shows that the LA ICE office continues to deny parole even when release is warranted, or to impose unaffordable bonds.
Many asylum seekers and immigrants in California are jailed for well-over a year. Our researchers met with one detainee who has been held in immigration detention for over FOUR years in California.		It's inhumane, unnecessary &amp; wasteful.	https://t.co/ky6J0ibnsN

.@RepJerryNadler: "This administration has repeatedly implored asylum seekers to come to ports of entry. At the same time, CBP is limiting the # of people who can apply each day. These conflicting messages cause confusion, and force migrants to take dangerous routes to the U.S.
These deaths point to the predictable consequences of CBP’s policy of illegally blocking asylum seekers at the border and intentionally limiting the number who can seek asylum, including those who have credible fears of persecution in Mexico itself.
Sadly, Jakelin’s was not the only death reported this week. Two Honduran teenagers were murdered in Tijuana after traveling to the U.S.-Mexico border. And a young man who traveled with the caravan was murdered in Tegucigalpa, Honduras after being deported.

Together with @NIJC and Williams &amp; Connelly, LLP, we are moving ahead in support of our clients, who came to the border seeking protection and were effectively told that the United States was closed for business. 		This asylum ban will not stand up in court.
When they arrived near the border, it was covered with police officers. He did not know that he "needed" to go to a port of entry to seek asylum.		So he crossed and looked for a CBP agent. 		Agents told him to go home because the government "was no longer helping people."
Ernesto* and his four-year-old daughter Alma* fled Honduras after members of the 18th street gang murdered two of his brothers and threatened his life. Ernesto went to the police, and the 18th street gang burned his house down.		He had no choice but to flee.
Lucy* and her son *Fernando were forced to flee from her husband's relentless violence and death threats. When they arrived at the border, they assumed it was closed when they saw the military lined up.		So they crossed. Now we're working to ensure that they can access safety.
Our client *Jesus is a 17-year-old boy. He was abused by his father and repeatedly threatened by MS-13 members for refusing to join their ranks. He knew he would be killed if he didn't flee. 		President Trump's illegal asylum ban blocks him from life-saving protection.
We will continue fighting on behalf of *Maria, who fled decades of abuse at the hands of her partner, who killed her father and sent gang members to threaten her. After crossing the border to seek asylum, she discovered that she was no longer eligible for protection.
By blocking individuals from seeking asylum, the administration acted illegally and turned its back on our nation’s ideals. We are committed to fighting for our clients and the principle that the Trump Administration is not above the law. 		https://t.co/g3Stsh7rtK

While the myriad of immigration news can be overwhelming, this simple fact is true, the Trump Administration’s policies are devastatingly cruel to innocent children who traveled to the United States in search of protection. /END
Trying to illegally bar them from seeking asylum between ports of entry, making them wait for months at the border, proposing a plan to force them to stay in Mexico, and spraying tear gas on innocent women and children are the latest heartbreaking examples.
And with President Trump’s treatment of the men, women, and children traveling to the United States as part of the caravan, it is once again remarkably clear that he wants to punish families—and children—for seeking refuge.
The government is also allowing the facility to sidestep health care requirements—with just 1 doctor for every 100 children, the facility is unable to provide adequate care. Our researchers have documented a similar lack of medical care at facilities across the country.
Recent reports reveal that the staff at the facility are not undergoing traditional FBI background checks, substantially increasing the risk that an individual with a criminal history could have direct access to children. https://t.co/1jnXymyNWO
The effects of this are being felt across the country, as well as in the Tornillo detention center—the largest “tent city” built under President Trump. Some of the 2,300 teenagers detained there have been sleeping in canvas tents in the desert since June.
Because of this, family members are unable to pick up their relatives from detention, extending the periods of incarceration for children. Because of the administration’s hateful policies, children remain separated from their loved ones for months or even longer.
Officials from DHS and HHS are also using information obtained from incarcerated children to locate their parents—not to reunite them—but to arrest and deport them. 		The U.S. government is turning children into unwilling informants, using them as bait. https://t.co/WCMQi2EofJ
Despite the end of the zero-tolerance policy, reports show that the administration is *again* separating children from their parents (or perhaps never stopped.) This time using vague or unsubstantiated allegations against parents as the justification. https://t.co/DiL81jqeak
Trump officials repeatedly compared detention facilities to “summer camps” while building “tent cities” for thousands of migrant teenagers, sending children to foster homes away from their families, and ripping babies from their mothers’ arms.
Yet, the administration doubled-down, requesting to repeal the “Flores Settlement Agreement,” the court order that restricts the amount of time that families can be incarcerated. 		The administration wants to INCREASE the length of time children can remain behind bars.
The administration left children to languish behind bars, despite being briefed on the negative effects of incarceration on children. The American Academy of Pediatrics (@AmerAcadPeds) has repeatedly warned that detention results in psychological distress, PTSD, and suicidality.
The president’s “zero-tolerance” policy this summer resulted in the forced separation of thousands of asylum-seeking children from their families—some for months on end. The American people saw the consequences of this policy first-hand, leading to protests across the country.

Bottom Line: Asylum seekers should not be refused protection because of the many hurdles placed in their path to safety. In fact, U.S. law and international treaty commitments guarantee refugees an avenue to seek asylum regardless of how they entered the country.
5⃣ Many people lack accurate information about how to seek refuge in the United States and may only hear rumors and misinformation from smugglers and other migrants. They know that they can request asylum once they step foot on U.S. soil, so they cross between POE's.
4⃣ Some asylum-seekers face acute risks in Mexico from cartel groups and gangs, including murder, rape, kidnapping, and human trafficking. Unable to wait weeks or months in these conditions, many families are forced to cross between official border points.
3⃣ CBP officials have—in an orchestrated manner—restricted the number of asylum seekers processed at ports of entry daily, forcing asylum seekers to wait for extended periods in dangerous and difficult conditions.
2⃣ Customs and Border Protection officers “turn back” asylum seekers by outright refusal or by telling them to come back another day. After being turned away—often multiple times—some asylum seekers choose to cross between ports to request their legal right to asylum.
1⃣ Mexican immigration officials often block asylum seekers from approaching U.S. border posts. Our researchers have seen this first-hand. Mexican officials—under the request of CBP—physically stand at the port of entry, preventing people from requesting protection.
After Trump announced his illegal decision to bar people who cross between ports of entry from asylum, a lot of people asked why asylum-seekers cross between ports of entry in the first place. Here's our fact sheet to explain why: https://t.co/OVcxuGTc7L https://t.co/lIbHiINZ8X

Seeking asylum IS NOT A CRIME, and people are entitled to seek asylum regardless of where they cross the border.
For two years this administration has systematically undermined the asylum and refugee protection systems. It has illegally turned away refugees at official border points, forcing desperate individuals to make the dangerous crossing between points.
The case, O.A. v. Trump, was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The filing can be found here: https://t.co/0kzclxGTk6
The lead plaintiff, O.A., is here with his 4-yr-old daughter. They fled Honduras after O.A. tried to help the police investigate the murder of his brother and was then targeted himself—with death threats and an attempt to kill him by burning down his house.
The plaintiffs in today's case either entered the United States outside an official border entry point after being turned away or forced to wait in unsafe conditions near inspection points, or because they did not realize that going to a port of entry was an option.
"By blocking these brave individuals from seeking asylum, the administration acted illegally and turned its back on our nation’s ideals. We are committed to fighting for our clients and the principle that the Trump Administration is not above the law."
“The U.S. was built as a haven for the persecuted. Today’s refugees at our southern border—Human Rights First’s clients—are no different than those who have landed on our shores for generations in search of a safe and dignified life for themselves and their families." @M_Breen
The plaintiffs in O.A. v. Trump are six asylum seekers, including three children, who were illegally barred from seeking asylum because they entered the United States outside of an official border point.

We’re gearing up to send monitors to the U.S.-Mexico border to raise alarms when refugees are turned away or punished for seeking this country’s protection. And we’re continuing to provide life-saving legal representation to refugees.
With this new Congress, we will continue to fight for freedom and dignity for those who are brave enough to seek safety on our shores. We’re working to FREE refugees from behind bars, ensuring that no child grows up in jail.
We have 40 years of experience working to protect and bolster the rights of refugees here in the United States. Our staff is dedicated to representing our asylum-seeking clients, to combatting misinformation, and to fighting back against inhumane and unnecessary policies.
Whether its the admin’s cruel family separation and incarceration policies, their attempts to roll back protection for refugees, or the politically-motivated decision to send thousands of troops to the border, we’ll be using our policy know-how to get results from Congress.
As we close out this contentious election season, Human Rights First is looking to the future. 		And that starts with a vigorous congressional oversight agenda, to ensure that the cruel policies enacted by the Trump Administration are exposed for what they are.
President Trump’s closing bid to voters was clear: be afraid. Be afraid of refugees desperately fleeing persecution in their home countries.		But President Trump’s agenda failed, because Americans will not allow hate and fear-mongering to undermine what our country stands for.
THREAD: Yesterday, millions of voters made their voices heard in support of the American ideals that we hold dear: diversity, tolerance, and compassion. 		Americans stood together to show that President Trump's fear-mongering closing bid did not represent them.

Immigrants appear for their immigration court hearings at high rates, particularly when they have legal representation or case management support, and accurate information related to the court process.		Clearly the president has no understanding of the process or of the facts.

Or our client Emmanuel*, a political and minority rights activist who fled Ethiopia after being detained and tortured by the government. With the assistance of Human Rights First and a team of pro bono attorneys, he was recently granted asylum by the immigration court.
Refugees like our client Gabriela*, an attorney from El Salvador who escaped death threats by MS-13 after refusing to defend them in court. 		Since being granted asylum in the U.S., Gabriela is now committed to using her legal skills to assist other survivors of violence.
It’s because we know that refugees love America. They contribute to this nation in a myriad of ways, whether that be opening businesses, defending this nation in uniform, or simply being active members of their communities.
This is why the staff at Human Rights First continues to be committed to common-sense solutions, to safeguarding the refugee and asylum systems from attacks, and to the protection of brave families fleeing unspeakable violence in Central America and beyond.
And since there is no “safe third country” agreement in place with Mexico, refugees and migrants are not legally bound to request asylum in Mexico first. 		President Trump and Secretary Nielsen have no legal basis to tell members of the caravan that they must “turn around.”
Why don’t they all just stop in Mexico?		Our research shows that Mexico is not safe for many refugees and asylum seekers. Certain groups—including the LGBTQ community, people with indigenous heritage, and many foreigners in general—face consistent persecution in Mexico.
#FactsMatter: Despite the administration’s rhetoric, a large portion of caravan members have chosen to stay in Mexico to seek asylum, while others have bravely chosen to continue their journey to ask this nation for protection.
By the time this caravan—which is still ~1,000 miles away—arrives at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number will have further dwindled, making it part of daily asylum requests that our nation is more than able to address.
It’s especially wasteful when we know that asylum requests from members of the caravan would not represent an “invasion” or “influx.” 		During the last caravan, 400 asylum requests were made, which was entirely on par with daily and monthly trends.
Sending thousands of troops to the border is both wasteful and reckless. Dozens of national security experts have stated that further militarizing our borders is financially costly, harmful to our nation's security, and is a clear misuse of the military for political purposes.
Many of the mothers, fathers, and young children involved in the #CaravanaMigrante have bravely risked their lives to seek their LEGAL right to asylum. 		These families should not be met at out southern border with machine guns.
But our 40+ years of experience show that this is nothing more than political fear-mongering days before the midterm elections. The United States can handle asylum requests from caravan members in an orderly fashion—as we have successfully done for decades.
And daily attacks on the families and children that constitute a refugee and migrant caravan are inundating the airwaves—with President Trump manufacturing a national emergency to further his partisan agenda.
Right now, our mission is far from easy. This administration has doubled down on some of the cruelest policies imaginable—family separation, family incarceration, “tent cities,” and the drastic reduction in annual refugee admissions.
THREAD: No matter how refugees and asylum seekers are demonized and vilified, Human Rights First is committed to serving our asylum-seeking clients, to fighting back against misinformation, and to ensuring that refugees can live in freedom and dignity in the United States.

This is a massive waste of government funds, since the overwhelming majority of represented families appear for their hearings without detention. https://t.co/n9d2uIpbdK

Refugees have long been the most thoroughly screened travelers to the U.S. The admin’s decision to subject them to extra security checks, accompanied by the sharp reduction in the number of checks conducted, makes clear that the aim is to grind resettlement to a standstill.
By rolling back resettlement, the United States hurts not only refugees but also itself. By sharing the responsibility, the U.S. would relieve the strain on front-line countries, helping to secure their stability and reduce the potential for escalating regional volatility.

Statement from our @RobBerschinski 👇	https://t.co/69WD33RCDC
As should surprise no one at this point in the Trump presidency, what the President of the United States presented to the world wasn’t so much an articulation of American values as a rejection of what has made this country both great and good.
Gone is both JFK’s pledge to “bear any burden” and Ronald Reagan’s call to “tear down this wall.” Gone are appeals to the "better angels of our nature.”
What we heard today from President Trump at the U.N. General Assembly diverges wildly from American values and interests as expressed by a long line of previous presidents of both political parties.
What our president fails to understand is that international cooperation on migration does not sacrifice U.S. "sovereignty," it actually advances U.S. interests.
Even in praising those states, like Jordan, that are bearing the brunt of the global flow of refugees, Trump managed to hide behind the work of others to mask administration policies that are harming the most vulnerable.
President Trump's emphatic rejection of the Global Compact on Migration is yet another indication that this administration is deciding not to lead internationally when it comes to solving hard, transnational problems.
His attacks on the UN Human Rights Council and International Criminal Court amount to saying that the U.S. is no longer in the business of improving flawed international bodies, and will be seen by mass-murderers like Bashar al Assad and Burma’s military leaders as a boon.
Trump’s overly-simplistic and distorted view of “sovereignty” will be music to the ears of authoritarian leaders from Moscow to Beijing.	https://t.co/dJj1NEpF8d

ICE claims that family detention facilities are humane in nature, comparing them to summer camps. 		But summer camps do not get stormed by armed guards who arrest campers and separate them from their children to retaliate against non-violent protest. https://t.co/JO42f1vvwZ

@realDonaldTrump and AG Sessions are not trying to “secure our borders” or improve the immigration system. They are simply attempting to punish all immigrants arriving at our borders out of desperation.
Despite these successes, @realDonaldTrump axed the program in 2017 in favor of separating families and throwing them in cages. So, what exactly is the Trump Administration trying to accomplish?
In fact, a 2017 review of the DHS office found that the Family Case Management Program had a 99% success rate for families attending ICE check-ins and appointments, and a 100% success rate for families attending their court hearings.
Instead, time and time again, data has proven that programs like the Family Case Management Program are cheaper, more effective, and more humane than the incarceration of families. https://t.co/XcV7IZhN1h https://t.co/ZXseChMztW

Our data analysis has shown time and time again that families and children with legal counsel show up to their court hearings nearly 100 percent of the time. These people are not trying to evade the law: some just need help navigating the process. https://t.co/jArmpFJfiW
Another important takeaway: people with attorneys were much more likely to make their court dates. Asylum seekers with access to legal representation and case management have help in navigating the complex legal system and in communicating with the court.
If the Trump Administration is genuinely concerned about making sure asylum seekers stay in the legal process, there are solutions. The administration should devote its energy to smoothing the bureaucratic obstacles that are the real heart of the problem. https://t.co/0OykSoANgx
All of us who work in the asylum representation space know that asylum-seekers want to comply with rules set into place. It’s just that the system makes it almost impossible for them, flooding them with legal and bureaucratic obstacles that are difficult to understand.
The administration could do a better job of coordinating between agencies so that migrants only need to update their addresses once. (See below stories 👇). But instead, the administration adopted a blanket approach that assumes that all families are trying to evade the law. https://t.co/rNVRoyozjs

Many parents accept deportation because they think that they will then be reunited with their children. Others choose to be deported because they would rather be sent back to danger than face blatant mistreatment and abuse in prison-like detention centers.

Read more from our @AcereEleanor on why every effort must be made to place families in community-based programs that offer medical, mental health, legal, social, and other supports. https://t.co/abEddmWZRw
This false choice narrative propelled by the administration—family separation or family detention—conspicuously omits migration management strategies like the Family Case Management Program that are effective, proven, and far less costly and cruel.
At Human Rights First, we provide pro bono legal representation to refugees seeking asylum. From this experience, we know that asylum seekers who are afforded accurate information and legal representation overwhelmingly appear for their immigration removal hearings.
Not only is the detention of children “never in their best interests,” but family detention may also “constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment” in violation of the Convention Against Torture. https://t.co/D0R78uLcNX
The Family Case Management Program cost around $12 per person, per day. Family detention costs over $300 dollars per person, per day. Other alternative programs cost as low as 30 cents to $8.04 per person, per day. https://t.co/nq3xYaaGtl
Another alternative to detention program, explained by the @CatoInstitute, resulted in 99.6% compliance. And was found to be much cheaper, more humane, and more effective than incarceration programs.
DHS’s own advisory committee recommended expansion of community-based case management programs rather than family detention. Concluding that detention is “never in the best interest of children,” the committee recommended DHS “discontinue the general use of family detention." https://t.co/mpw28v2YOS
Like the Family Case Management Program—operated by ICE—that resulted in 99% attendance for ICE check-ins and appointments, as well as 100% attendance at court hearings. https://t.co/YNzWlPuzL6

Immigrants who seek asylum are not criminals, even though they are now being charged as such. Most of those seeking admission at our southern border are not economic migrants seeking a better life but are asylum seekers fleeing for their lives.
Asylum claims must be decided on their individual merits, not with technicalities or categorical bars. Sessions cannot take these peoples lives into his hands and turn them away or block entire groups from their legal right to protection. https://t.co/oHAC88kCtY
There are several problems with asylum seekers being turned away or turned back to harm at our southern border.		1. It is ILLEGAL	2. It is sending people back to their deaths
.@Prof_LMHarris recalls border agents telling their clients as early as 2016 that “there is no asylum. Trump is going to be president, and you’ll all be sent home.” Since his inauguration, problems in the asylum system have only increased.
In early 2017, we documented 125 cases of Border Patrol agents unlawfully turning back asylum seekers. Lately, border officers tell asylum seekers to “come back later,” turning away one family nine times. https://t.co/ZPGTNDWOF1
Seeking asylum in the United States has never been easy, by design. But under Trump, it’s become arbitrarily harder—and impossible for some. Even before the 2016 election, border officials began turning back asylum seekers in greater numbers. https://t.co/JLXOQIxobf

Despite these successes, @realDonaldTrump axed the program in 2017 in favor of separating families and throwing them in cages. So, what exactly is the Trump Administration trying to accomplish?
In fact, a 2017 review of the DHS office found that the Family Case Management Program had a 99% success rate for families attending ICE check-ins and appointments, and a 100% success rate for families attending their court hearings. https://t.co/FaXLvcAD9U

More than unsafe, these family detention centers are also unnecessary. Alternatives to detention, like the Family Case Management Program, resulted in 99.8% compliance, as reported by ICE itself. https://t.co/vaP0sNiman https://t.co/TImHvoCoN1
These facilities are not safe for children. They trigger distress, including self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, developmental regressions, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Children may suffer physical health problems, such as weight loss and frequent infections.
Children in detention don’t want to eat, they just cry. One mother stated, "my daughter is seeing a psychologist for the trauma she suffers from the death of her father. But what about the trauma she suffers from being detained?” https://t.co/dVRKJQcXeZ
A mother who was detained for six months along with her nine year old son recounted: “[My son] would tell me, ‘I’m not a criminal that should be held in this place,’” and, “My son, crying, told me that if I didn’t get him out of there, he would throw himself from the roof.”
Another example: At the El Paso Processing Center, a detainee from a Muslim majority country said that guards have called him a “stupid Taliban terrorist” and that kitchen staff have called him a “Muslim terrorist.” Another officer said, “You guys are my enemy.”
One detainee who was imprisoned with her children in Pennsylvania: "agents mock our dignity as immigrants. We came here seeking refuge. We came to this country to save our lives and the lives of our children.” https://t.co/S7s4cl43X4
Children have suffered psychological damage, and many have suffered health-wise, because of the confinement—not to mention the racist abuse and poor treatment from certain members of the staff in the detention center.
An 11-year-old girl locked in prison with her family: "A few days after I arrived here, I realized that this was going to be very hard. I try to go outside, distract myself with some activities. We are not delinquents who should be imprisoned." https://t.co/lujPNvWBU2
Trump and Sessions don't seem to care if their detention centers are filthy, inhumane, or medically unsafe. Instead, they see these conditions as measurable deterrents to any refugees desperate enough to come to our borders.
One detainee in El Paso stated: “Is El Paso even part of the United States? Do they follow international laws here? I thought the U.S. was one of the most recognized countries for human rights, and I come here and find the worst form of human treatment.” #EndFamilyDetention
In fact, almost everyone interviewed reported high levels of stress and anxiety stemming from a variety of factors, including: lack of sleep, poor nutrition, unhygienic conditions, isolation, and uncertainty of their legal cases. https://t.co/gpqlexV2fP
Mental health, too, is a serious concern for detainees, many of whom suffer from PTSD, depression, and anxiety. These issues generally worsen with prolonged detention, and many who need psychotherapy services never receive it.
More reports from the NJ facility claim that food is often spoiled or expired, leaving it inedible. One detainee at Hudson claimed to have lost 15 pounds during only 3 weeks of detention due to the food quality.
Many facilities themselves are unhygienic or unsanitary. Human Rights First researchers talked to several individuals held at a detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey who said they found worms or maggots in the showers on multiple occasions.  https://t.co/pPzdEyYBrC
One detainee stated: “This is a modern ghetto. They want to break us mentally … We haven’t committed any crime … The treatment here is very criminal. You cannot access justice here.”
We conducted interviews and research on the ground of multiple facilities and found: improper medical care; inadequate mental health services; filthy and unhealthy living conditions; and more atrocities. These detention centers are prisons. https://t.co/dNHMXi5CaH

But for children, Trump's policy of family detention means further trauma and further abuse. Mental health evaluations for detained children contain diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, which have been either perpetuated or exacerbated by detention.
Family detention violates international human rights standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee on the Rights of the Child states that immigration detention of children “is never in their best interests and is not justifiable.”
It is impermissible under international law to send individual refugees and migrants into automatic detention in order to send a message to deter other individuals from coming to the United States. https://t.co/UDvLcqhdjj
“We have spent birthdays here, Christmas, the New Year, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day. It’s difficult to explain [to our children] why we are still here.” Read more from our 2016 report 👇 https://t.co/S7s4cl43X4
Detention unnecessarily exposes families with high rates of previous trauma, physical and sexual abuse, and exploitation to additional psychological trauma, putting children and their parents at greater risk for physical and mental health problems.
Prolonged detention—even with family members—has serious negative consequences for children, including suicidal gestures, anxiety, sleeplessness, behavioral regressions, and lack of appetite. it's still prison like conditions for children.

These people are fleeing unimaginable violence. They arrive in the United States desperate for safety, desperate for a place free from fear. And yet, today, the U.S. is separating them from their children, placing them in detention for months, and treating them like criminals. https://t.co/k4vBPUKyuK
Our client *Sophie, a mother of two from El Salvador, was separated from her sons—one under the age of 10, the other under 5—in May and hasn’t seen them since. Sophie has been told what state her children are in, but has not been able to speak with them.
*Arlin was physically, sexually, and psychologically abused by the father of her children over a period of several years. After she was raped at gunpoint and told that she would be killed, Arlin fled Honduras to seek asylum in the United States. She was granted asylum in April.
*Emely was assaulted, extorted, robbed, and threatened by gang members. She was targeted because of her relationship to a police man, who was murdered by gang members. She fled Honduras with her two young children to save their lives. The family was granted asylum in March.
*Raj was repeatedly beaten, abducted, and sexually assaulted by Bangladeshi government agents for his involvement with an opposition party. The police interrogated and beat Raj, forcing him to flee. With the help of Human Rights First, he was granted asylum earlier this month.
*Sergei and his family faced persecution in Russia because of their identity. They fled to Azerbaijan, where Sergei's sister was raped and Sergei was attacked. Sergei escaped to the United States, where he was granted asylum this past February.
*Victoria suffered years of domestic violence and abuse in Honduras. She fled when her partner threatened to kill her then-10-year-old daughter. Victoria and her daughter were granted asylum. Victoria is now working to petition her five other children, who remain in danger.
A teenager from Tajikistan, *Ali was threatened by the government because of his father, who had spoken out and written critically about the government. In June, Ali was granted asylum. He plans to apply for a travel visa to visit his father in Canada.
*Mariam suffered severe violence at the hands of her husband in Burkina Faso. The police told her that it was her fault for "not respecting" her husband. Mariam fled to the United States for safety. She is now living in New Jersey, taking classes and learning English.
An academic from Ethiopia, *Dr. Achebe conducted research on government corruption in his country. He was arbitrarily tortured and arrested, and finally fled to the United States. With help from Human Rights First and two pro bono attorneys, he was granted asylum in June.
*Jean was held captive, beaten, and tortured by his government for his political activities. Fearing for his life, he fled Togo, leaving behind his infant son. Jean was granted asylum in 2016. This past May, he was finally reunited with his now 6-year-old son.
*Lucas and *Eduardo—eight and four years old—arrived in the United States desperate to escape from their abusive father. Two weeks after their interview with the asylum officer, the boys were granted asylum. They celebrated by eating ice cream sundaes.
*Isabel was abducted, raped, and held against her will by a drug cartel in Mexico. When she told her brother about it, the cartel murdered him. She quickly fled, traveling thousands of miles with her son. In February, Isabel and her son were granted asylum.
*Luz, a citizen of El Salvador, suffered domestic abuse for years at the hands of her husband. Police refused to protect her. She had no choice but to flee. With the help of Human Rights First, she was granted asylum in June.
On #WorldRefugeeDay, these are the stories of the people that President Trump and Jeff Sessions believe belong in cages. These are the people that they are trying to dehumanize, separate from their children, and send back to harm. These are people seeking refuge.

Detaining children along with their parents would imprison kids for doing nothing wrong. Do these lawmakers truly have no shame? https://t.co/3hynq6r2pQ
By trying to indefinitely detain traumatized children and parents seeking protection in the U.S., the Trump Administration is doubling down on their cruelty. There is no scenario in which children should be held in prison—held in cages—like criminals. https://t.co/0cSzXXkj79
Keeping people in detention is not the answer. Keeping families together in cages is not the answer. Family detention is traumatizing for children and young adults, as well as their parents. It doesn't solve the problem. Indeed, it just creates new ones.
86 percent of individuals released from ICE detention in 2015 pursuant to a bond hearing complied with their appearance obligations. Read the facts 👇https://t.co/FOrIgMaa7a
Families and children with legal counsel are in compliance nearly 100% of the time. To say otherwise is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts.

We're fighting to protect the asylum system. What's happening isn't "enforcing the law." In fact, it’s not a law at all. It's Sessions' way of using cruelty as a tool to deter any refugee from partaking in the lawful asylum system. https://t.co/L7qX2JWta6
And we fight for refugees who are illegally turned away at the border. Families like the Berudo's who were turned away and told that there was "no space" at Customs and Border Patrol stations for them. "If we go back home," they said, "they will kill us." https://t.co/suvXO29eJv
We are fighting for refugees who don’t get a shot at due process. Who are offered only dehumanizing mass “trials,” in which large groups of refugees shout their answers to a judge in unison without the opportunity to argue their individual case. https://t.co/Mw0HuMrL1H
We are fighting for refugees fleeing domestic violence, despite Sessions’ newest policy making it even harder for battered women to qualify for asylum. Refugees like our client *Mariam, who fled her abusive husband after he stabbed her twice in the back. https://t.co/5L8wndsJNi
We fight for the nearly 2,500 children who have been separated from their families. Babies, infants, kids, and teenagers, who now live scared, in inhumane conditions, unsure of when they will next see their parents. https://t.co/Q1MJF1WOEo
We're fighting for our client *Sophie, a mother of two from El Salvador, who was separated from her sons—one under the age of 10, the other under 5—in May and hasn’t seen them since. Sophie has been told what state her children are in, but has not been able to speak with them.
We fight for fathers like Eric, who fled to the border with his 3-year-old son after receiving death threats. Border officers took his son without clothes or authorization. "I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's hurt. I don't know anything." https://t.co/qa9asvRsLb
We fight for mothers like Mirian who requested asylum at the border with her infant son, only to have him taken away the next morning. She remembers his screams as officers buckled him into the car, “without giving me even a moment to comfort him.” https://t.co/r9QPxfsjS1
On #WorldRefugeeDay, let's not forget who we are fighting for... https://t.co/Eo2r3OxKdL
Every minute, 20 refugees are forced to flee their homes due to violence and persecution. These refugees have a legal right to request asylum at the U.S. border. Sessions, however, is using his zero-tolerance policy to try and deter all asylum seekers from seeking protection.
After WW2, the U.S. stepped forward as a world leader in aiding refugees from across the globe. Today, Attorney General Sessions is attempting to uproot this legacy through brutal, manufactured policies that narrow and alter the ways in which refugees seek protection.

This border-wide policy is quite clearly unlawful. There is no fair access to the asylum process right now, which is a clear violation of U.S. and international law.
These are people who are trying to follow the rules and present themselves as required. Yet, agents at the bridge tell them to come back when there is capacity. Where are they expected to go until then? Mexico isn't safe for them.
In the @latimes, the story of families stuck in limbo. “We heard if you cross in the river they will separate you from your family,” they said. “That’s why we came on the bridge.” https://t.co/IptEEZbTXW
Here's @nytimes with the story of a mother and her 2 children who slept on the ground for 2 weeks in their effort to seek their legal right to asylum. The Trump Administration is sending a message: wait; and when the wait becomes too long, go home. https://t.co/e71C7nJ2F2
Also from @BobMooreNews: the story of three migrants—a badly sunburned woman, her baby, and a 16-year-old girl. Despite the fact that federal law allows immigrants to step into the U.S. and claim asylum, agents are physically preventing them from doing so. https://t.co/cuhXmBSmWY
We have this administration that’s saying, ‘Come to the port of entry; we’re going to prosecute everybody who doesn’t come to the port of entry seeking asylum.’ And now we have CBP agents continuously turning people away. In reality, they don’t want anybody to come.
The Trump Administration is doing the same thing to Serbando Pineda Hernandez and his 15-year-old son, Riquelmer, who waited on a bridge to request asylum for 9 days. Here's @BobMooreNews with the story. https://t.co/htrXtisC7l
So what's a family to do? They cannot go back to their home countries, where they will likely be killed. The Trump Administration is blocking access to asylum in every way it can, forcing families to make impossible choices.
A message is being broadcast across the nation that migrants should be seeking asylum through official channels. But the Trump Administration is making it impossible. People are being turned away, told that there's no room, or told that they cannot enter the bridge.
Only 10 to 15 asylum seekers show up a day at this bridge. It makes no sense why U.S. agents are saying there's no room in their station to process people who follow the law. And this is happening all over the U.S.-Mexico border. https://t.co/gt6EE9Gjjx

There are no laws that compel the United States to separate families, to criminally prosecute asylum seekers, or to send children to tent cities. Sessions is creating a false narrative to justify his criminal treatment of immigrants and refugees.
Today, Jeff Sessions stated that Americans must "obey the laws of the government." The problem is, Jeff Sessions is NOT obeying the laws. Criminally prosecuting asylum seekers and sending them back to danger violates U.S &amp; international law. https://t.co/wJznS1x6X2
"At its core, asylum is an instrument to preserve the right to life. Families are the foundational element of our society and they must be able to stay together. Separating babies from their mothers is not the answer and is immoral"—Cardinal Daniel DiNardo https://t.co/ecn13pJgrz
Thanks to Sessions's "zero-tolerance" policy that rips children away from their parents, there has been a surge in the number of refugee children held in U.S. custody. Today, there are 11,432 migrant children in custody, up from fewer than 9,000 in late May.
Reminder: this is happening in the United States in 2018.

Asylum is a LEGAL right. Yet these vulnerable migrants and refugees are being forcibly separated from their families and treated like criminals. https://t.co/eqNYxZNu9c
Ms. G, a Mexican asylum seeker, presented at a port of entry with her blind six-year-old daughter and her four-year-old son. Ms. G was separated from them, unable to receive information about their whereabouts for weeks. https://t.co/P50eNodzpW
Mirian arrived at a port of entry with her 18-month-old asking for protection. She presented documents verifying their biological relationship. Despite this, “the officers forced me to strap my son into a car seat . . . and then shut the door." https://t.co/9Mo5hDawYG
“Ms. L,” a Congolese mother, presented herself at a port of entry with her daughter to seek asylum. Border officials separated them, sending her daughter to a shelter thousands of miles away. They were separated for months with only intermittent phone communication.
4 fathers and their children arrived at the border fleeing death threats, only to be brutally separated. “What’s happening?” one of the girls asked her father. “You made me a promise that you would take me to where the princesses are.” https://t.co/qa9asvRsLb
“Brenda,” a Honduran asylum seeker, was forcibly separated from her infant son at a port of entry. Border Patrol Agents "put him in a car and he started to cry, but they closed the door and put me in another car… It is so hard because he is so small and he doesn’t understand.”
Marbel was separated from her eight-year-old son after the two arrived at a port of entry. It took her more than two weeks to learn that he had been sent to a facility across the country—in New York State.
Olga arrived at an official port of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border with her four children to request asylum. After being allowed to cross the border, her children were taken from her. “[T]hey never let me say goodbye,” she said. https://t.co/jNY1KYAi9P
Yet even when asylum seekers follow the Trump Administration's guidelines and arrive at official border stations—doing exactly what they are supposed to do—they are still being separated from their families. Here are a few stories:
Sessions' policy is designed to criminally prosecute adults—thereby sending their children to separate facilities or into "foster care of whatever." This policy applies to the crime of "illegal entry or reentry" which can only occur between ports of entry.

“What’s happening?” he recalled Sofia saying. “You made me a promise that you would take me to where the princesses are.”
