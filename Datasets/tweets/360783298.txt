@TheRev1953 SBP is a voluntary insurance policy at retirement (monthly premiums paid) and automatically given to active duty at no cost while active duty. After retirement they are given a choice to continue to pay premiums. Ex’s can demand SBP in divorce decree.
@TheRev1953 #2. All the ex-spouses have to do is demand it in the divorce decree. In some cases if not in divorce decree the ex-spouse has to sign off on it for SBP to go to the widow. This offset is discriminating to nearly all widows/ers!
@TheRev1953 Yes, when there is a divorce the ex-spouse, if married long enough while service member is active duty can demand SBP to go to them if there’s a divorce. I’ve seen this happen many times during a divorce. Google SBP and divorce. No offset on SBP. #WidowsTax

@marshallofall1 @tedcruz I don’t live in Texas but advocate for the widows who have this offset in all 50 states. Very few people know about this offset on an insurance annuity on our fallen hero’s spouses! There’s members of Congress and the Senate that don’t know about it!
@marshallofall1 @tedcruz Yes...his widows in his state have tired and tired to get him to do something. I’m hoping his other constituents will see this and contact him too. I think the more he hears from people that one day he’ll he might do something.  #WidowsTax

@Southern_Yang @id2506 @consmover @adjunctprofessr @SenTedCruz @RandPaul @SenatorWicker @senorrinhatch @SenMikeLee @SenateGOP Exactly! I’m 100% offset on my Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and the really unfair thing is the remarriage clause! I can receive both DIC and SBP if I remarry! 	We’re all being penalized for remaining widows and widowers! Remarry and BOOM here’s your full SBP!
@Southern_Yang @Vincent75025849 @consmover @Katascadero @SenTedCruz @RandPaul @SenatorWicker @senorrinhatch @SenMikeLee @SenateGOP The Survivor Benefit Plan was offered at retirement as a voluntary insurance policy...the retirees could take it or leave it. I was there when my husband signed up for it and there was NEVER a mention of an offset. Just a big sales pitch on how great it was!
