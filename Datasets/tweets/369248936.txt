@AgentsofSHIELD I’d also like to see Jemma become the new permanent Director. I think the character is suitable for the job and I think it’s time they had another female director. I also hope SHIELD itself will be legitimised and fully restored to its pre-Hydra status once again.
@TheTimelessRoom I have an idea for a potential episode in season 3: the team learns that Rittenhouse is planning to take action against Empress Marie Feodorvana in 1916 &amp; find themselves, like her, conflicted over helping her in deposing her son Tsar Nicholas II to save Russia.
@AgentsofSHIELD I’m very glad there will be a season 6 :) I hope some previous main cast members will come back and I’d actually like to see @Lil_Henstridge become the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Jemma Simmons has a very good ring to it.

@ABCDesignated I have to be honest and say I’m not happy with Secretary Moss’ alleged resignation. He’s a good character and the Secretary of State has to be shown. Plus everything Moss said about Kirkman is right. I hope the next episode will reverse this action and keep Moss in as Secretary.
@ABCDesignated To be honest, I wasn’t happy with that. Moss is a very good character and I would like to see him stay on as Secretary of State - and promoted to a regular. I’d also like to see who Kirkman’s new Vice President and who the rest of the Cabinet are.

@Jamiroquai918 @ASJAustin It does seem to be a hard thing to find these days, but I think it's getting better. I even hope I might become friends with Austin one day.
@Jamiroquai918 @ASJAustin Absolutely - very few people can do that
@Jamiroquai918 @ASJAustin Some reasons why Austin's my favourite Ranger &amp; I'm grateful to be part of his Street Team. I hope to meet him in person in the near future
@Jamiroquai918 @ASJAustin Not to mention everything that he's done in real life as an EMT and a combat medic
@Jamiroquai918 @ASJAustin A lot of times over the course of the show, I think Austin was showing his real personality, and not just that of the character he played.
@Jamiroquai918 @ASJAustin I've liked the character development plots they created for Jason and Austin really shines in those eps. It's like he was playing himself.
@ASJAustin There are a couple that stand out for me because of their character centred plots - but one of the first was Ep. 4, "A Pressing Engagement"

@peterdaou I support @NancyPelosi as much as I support @HillaryClinton - two amazingly successful, dedicated women that America needs more than ever.

@AlexMohajer @ossoff Overall, I say these very close results &amp; moral victories for the Dems r encouraging for 2018. We still need @HillaryClinton as POTUS though

@AlexMohajer That solution is the simplest, most practical &amp; most moral. Hillary won the election &amp; US needs a strong leader &amp; a competent government now

@AlexMohajer @KeithOlbermann You two would be awesome together - you're both amazing journalists
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue can only happen with Hilary as President. I'm not going to give up hope on that.
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue Republican and a new election has too many potential pitfalls. America needs a strong leader and a competent government right now. And that
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue I believe it will happen. It's the right thing to do and it's the only real solution to this situation. No one wants Pence or another
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue Despite everything though, I'm convinced/hopeful that they will finally recognise &amp; officially swear in Hillary as the legitimate President.
@BonnieblueBlue I'm like that some days as well.
@BonnieblueBlue My respect for him as dropped a bit since then.
@BonnieblueBlue @AlexMohajer Some days I dread looking at the news because there's bound to be something about him making headlines.
@BonnieblueBlue @AlexMohajer My country's first female Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was treated really badly
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue saying that he regrets not running for President in 2016. To me, he's clearly implying that this situation is somehow Hillary's fault.
@AlexMohajer @BonnieblueBlue Exactly. Which is why I'm angry at VP Biden and GOP Senator Sasse saying that Biden would have won in a landslide if he had run that Biden
@BonnieblueBlue @AlexMohajer There are still double standards about women &amp; power - and yet history has several examples of strong women with power ruling very well.
@AlexMohajer I'm also astonished that some on the Democratic side are actually blaming her for this situation. It's completely unfair &amp; totally illogical
@AlexMohajer I remain convinced/hopeful that Hillary will be in the White House later this year. She deserves it after everything she's been put through.
@AlexMohajer It really is startling just how strong that sense of denial is on their respective parts
@DylanBruno12 I haven't heard of this movie before but it sounds really good :)
@AlexMohajer @SenJeffMerkley @ArianaGrande I applaud both Senator Merkley's strength of character and his physical stamina. Amazing job :)

@TVdub Very funny :) With a great view of the city :)
@BrenFosterReal I was really shocked when I heard about President Michener. I thought he was a great character
@BrenFosterReal @MarissaNeitling @TVdub I absolutely agree :)
@TVdub Have a great night Travis :) Til next time :)
@TVdub @MarissaNeitling @BrenFosterReal I've always liked Marissa to :)
@TVdub Sorry Travis, almost forgot to say that "A Chance for Change" is up on Facebook &amp; have a website. They should be easy to look up.
@TVdub @Dichenlachman She was terrific in @AgentsofSHIELD  Season 2 and @BridgetRegan was amazing in @AgentCarterTV  :)
@TVdub 2 friends run a non-profit called "A Chance for Change" to raise awareness of men's depression. I don't suppose u could support them?
@TVdub @BrenFosterReal You two do always look like you have a lot of fun together :)
@TVdub I think you're one of the nicest guys I've met :)
@TVdub @BrenFosterReal Sounds like fun :)
@TVdub @BrenFosterReal You two have always been two of my favourites from the show :)
@TVdub I would certainly volunteer to help. Some best friends are involved with charity &amp; non-profits and I help them out however I can.
@TVdub That's very hardcore and I'd like to see you do that to :)
@TVdub Is there anything that you haven't already done on the show that you want to do in Season 4?
@TVdub I went there in 2011 and it was a terrific place :) I've been wanting to go back there for a long time :)
@TVdub How did the work in Senegal go?
@TVdub I miss both her and President Michener - I was really shocked when that happened
@TVdub We certainly need to see more of that, this year has been a troubling one. I really admire and respect you for helping others
@TVdub What made you to decide to also take up charity work?
@TVdub You'll have to visit sometime, it's a terrific place :) I've never been to the US before, but I've always been interested in visiting
@BrenFosterReal Do you think there's a chance we might find out what's become of Australia in the new season?
@TVdub Have you ever been to Australia?
@TVdub Sounds like great fun :)
@TVdub Congratulations on getting a fourth season :) I had a feeling you would, but it's still great news :) Congratulations :)
@BrenFosterReal Congratulations on getting a fourth season :) I had a feeling you would, but it's still great news :) Congratulations :)

@Bryan_Baruch1 I was just saying that no matter how it's dressed up, extremism is dangerous and brings nothing but hatred and tragedy

@Bryan_Baruch1 I know you didn't and that it is a fair point - but at the same time we must be careful not to generalise.
@Bryan_Baruch1 As is right-wing extremism. The two are feeding off each other in a very dangerous cycle
@Bryan_Baruch1 It may help some, there r stories of former jihadis who turned their backs on terror. It doesn't happen often, but it can.
@Bryan_Baruch1 I would say all communities need that and I'm not just talking about  Islamic extremists, but the far-right as well.
@Bryan_Baruch1 Hard to say with any certainty, but stricter control laws would make such tragedies less likely to occur.
@Bryan_Baruch1 I'm not, I'm just saying not every Muslim is a fundamentalist and we shouldn't jump to conclusions yet.
@Bryan_Baruch1 I think it was a huge mistake by the FBI not to keep eye on the Orlando attacker
@Bryan_Baruch1 I agree, we must not blame whole groups of people for the actions of an extreme minority
@Bryan_Baruch1 or if he was acting alone
@Bryan_Baruch1 To my knowledge, it's not yet known whether the attacker is a fundamentalist or not, &amp; if he is, whether he's part of a cell
@Bryan_Baruch1 Gun control would minimise the risks of any terrorist, actual &amp; aspiring, from getting their hands on military-grade weapons.
@Bryan_Baruch1 It has been proven that proper education decreases extremism of all kinds
@AlexanderWraith Good advice Alex
@Bryan_Baruch1 I was very upset when I first heard. I couldn't believe there had been another attack in France. Now there's a coup in Turkey
