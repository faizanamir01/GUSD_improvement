@Bo10221616 @Zigmanfreud Sure, that makes sense. He was “trying” to lose his gig. (Perhaps you haven’t noticed, but Bob has been a commentator on several sports, including football, for years.)
@BickfordCountry @TheRealWaitWhat @jesteinmetz @Zigmanfreud That was the point. The NFL &amp; NBC made clear what their “principles” were — ignoring &amp; quashing the (well-documented &amp; supported conclusion that CTE risk is substantial, not negligible — even by one of the most respected sports media people. Pretty clear why, too.
This is key. The SBC won’t track abusers, &amp; has repeatedly rejected calls for reforms to protect victims of devaluation assault by church leaders.

@byrdshouse @MeanLin1 @Delphyne49er I think Vietnam, then the Cold War, captured the attention of most politicians. Race was a recurrent theme underpinning the right’s rise. As the article points out, even the GOP  wasn’t vocally anti-abortion, until after Roe when it became a helpful distraction.
@G8tekeeper @MeanLin1 @Delphyne49er @byrdshouse Lol! I was going to respond, until I got a look at your handle. Laughing at that silliness.
@MeanLin1 @Delphyne49er @byrdshouse @KevinMKruse FYI: Falwell Sr. Founded his all-white Lynchburg Christian school in reaction to desegregation of public schools.
@MeanLin1 @Delphyne49er @byrdshouse @KevinMKruse But the article is pretty clearly talking about the religious right, and how they shifted their position on abortion, to be more widely appealing, cover their racist positions on things like school segregafion.

@whazittoya @Karoli @MEPFuller Finally, another thing I appreciate about John Dingell was his wit &amp; how he expressed it, even as he was dying. That’s a grace many of us might not be able to hold onto in the same scenario. He still believed in us &amp; I’m grateful for his life &amp; service.
@whazittoya @Karoli @MEPFuller Sadly, things Dingell worked so hard on are what Republicans used to think were important (conservation, clean air &amp; water, wages), but current GOP/Trumpism has decided to dismantle.
@whazittoya @Karoli @MEPFuller As @Karoli points out, John Dingell was the real deal. He didn’t just sit on his butt for decades, but helped forge many critical bipartisan solutions — something Mitch long ago cynically &amp; selfishly gave up. He’s reduced the Senate to a football field &amp; he’s Lucy. Truly awful.
@whazittoya @Karoli @MEPFuller I can see the appeal of term limits as a “solution” to the miscreants, but it is myopic, if you look at it from the other POV. We *could* address that &amp; more, more effectively, w/true reform of campaign finance, better recruitment &amp; civic education, less apathy.

@Scarletpxi1 @darkenedsea @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction Nope. I took the time to look stuff up, not just from a site I claimed did one thing, but did something else entirely. Just do the research. If a site claims something, but makes money off of selling you on their “charity,” then it’s prudent to be suspicious. Look up the source.
@Scarletpxi1 @darkenedsea @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction Btw: VAERS staff follows up on reports (which are voluntary by individuals), but as they clearly state, they do not change the report (even if it turns out the cause was not related to the vaccine.  That’s important. (Not on your website.)
@Scarletpxi1 @darkenedsea @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction From VAERS own (actual “government run website”: 		“VAERS data should be used with caution as numbers and conditions do not reflect data collected during follow-up. Note that the inclusion of events in VAERS data does not imply causality.”
@darkenedsea @Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction While avoiding any proper research of applicable scientific information, like what VAERS actually is, what reports *actually* entail, &amp; what they mean to convey.
@darkenedsea @Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction It’s much easier to quote a website run by an organization who lies about its intentions, &amp; makes money off of calling itself a charity so they don’t have to pay taxes, but  takes donations from people they endanger.
@Scarletpxi1 @Sweetsir93 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction You negated your credibility when you touted a “government run website” that isn’t.
@Scarletpxi1 @darkenedsea @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction How would you know? Have you looked that up on VAERS yourself? Are you familiar with what is reported, why, &amp; what reports include? Or, for that matter, what stats are for exposure, w/o reports of contracted disease?
@Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction If you want to tour a “government run” website, then at least be honest &amp; look at one. You are clearly advocating something else entirely.
@Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction The website you touted *claims to present neutral info, but makes money off of pushing a biased, anti-vaxxer stance. If they aren’t honest about that, why would you trust them to give you medical advice about your child?
@Scarletpxi1 @heyuwoman @wheelchairwiz @SethMacFarlane @LeftAction The website you quoted is not what you claimed, the org. makes money from spewing anti-vaccine crap. They say they they want to give “independent” information, but promote only anti-vaxxing. That tells you who they are, &amp; why you shouldn’t trust them to give unbiased info.
@Scarletpxi1 @SethMacFarlane Again, misinformation spreads like a stupid meme.
@imforgivenryou @SethMacFarlane Research has been done, those claims have been debunked, even recanted by the people that made the claims. The challenge is informing people in an age where education is called “elitist” &amp; science is refuted by politicians &amp; anti-conservationists.

@SurfCityWriter @fordm That reminded me of the other part of this — where the hell were the many other ppl that saw/laid hands on this yrbk before publication? Thought you’d like this thread. I think it gives some better nuance. https://t.co/zZOnaUbPFc
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I daresay I have seen so many things that I found disturbing, but I couldn’t swear I  remember all of them, or the faces of the ppl involved. Some, sure. All? Maybe. Someone I knew well/trusted? Probably (in part because I’d be done w/them after blackface).
@SurfCityWriter @fordm His post sounded like these things would’ve happened at the same time. (Blackface, yearbook publication, &amp; graduation.) We don’t know when the yearbook came out, but I was saying that afterward, he’d be more focused on medicine &amp; moving forward, not what pics he took, if he did.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I worry that if a picture can derail a career decades later, who will we ever be able to trust? Bc pictures can be manipulated by anyone now. Will it mean that you have to decide as a child that you’re going to be a politician &amp; remain blemish-free? How is that possible?
@SurfCityWriter @fordm We’ve had a lot of discussions over the last few yrs about our attitudes &amp; actions &amp; how we’ve changed/evolved. Beyond this, &amp; in light of the cameraphones everywhere era, I am interested in how we are going to handle pictures coming back to haunt years later.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm And from the GOP responses, I think it’s obvious they see it as a “win.”  I think it’s awful &amp; I  don’t see how he survives it.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm Fact is, we don’t know what happened, or why, or wth made anyone think this was a good idea. I always wonder, when this stuff happens, what the motivation is behind such a revelation. I think that’s prudent, overall.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm When I saw this, my thought (after wth??) was whether someone on the yearbook staff had inserted a tasteless “joke” as a dig at him. I worked at a med school in the early 80s, &amp; I could imagine that kind of bad idea being thought of as “funny” by some of those guys.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I was often concerned about how some people’s actions seemed to be deliberately designed to make matters worse, not better, &amp; their motives for doing so.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I knew, and a lot of other people knew, that we’d never be caught dead wearing such a get-up. But I lived with &amp; around marginalized people my whole life. I was very sensitive to race issues.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm Worse, that it would make *them* seem racist. (A kind of compartmentalization often occurs around this.)
@SurfCityWriter @fordm So, while they (whoever is in the costume)  might have thought it was a stupid, even insulting “joke,” they (depending on their local experiences), might not have appreciated the real, hurtful way it would be felt to be racist, or
@SurfCityWriter @fordm And even in the case where white people might have found it offensive, they wouldn’t have necessarily said anything to the offenders. The routine racism I saw informs my beliefs about that.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I don’t know whether it was unsurprising in the area where Northam was, or whether this was an aberration. I just don’t think it was universally considered surprising/repugnant/offensive to white people.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm Btw: when I said “heard about,” I mean “heard about someone facing consequences for it.” Bc I guarantee it happened a lot more than the times it made the news.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I think it’s possible that those stories you mentioned (besides the political ones, bc that’s about politics) were “in the news” because they were rarely heard about. There were still a lot of places where there would have been more a “meh” reaction.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm For context, In 1984, probably most of the men I served with still thought it was okay to sexually harass women they worked with. Some said women “deserved it” for daring to join. Others disagreed, though remained quiet about it.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I don’t think that should be surprising, given what we’ve seen even over the last decade, of people **still** doing it, &amp; still acting like it doesn’t matter.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm In 1984, those stories being in the news might have been memorable, but there were still a lot of places where someone dressing up like that might have been laughed at — even nervously — but many others around them wouldn’t have called them out.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I remember the incident you referred to in Quincy, MA, because I was stationed not far from there at the time; so I hadn’t realized it was a national story.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm In 1984, I was in the Army. Reagan was President. I remember hearing a Senator on tv say that “we don’t want our women coming home in body bags.” (They we’re discussing why women shouldn’t be allowed to serve in combat roles, even if they wanted to.)
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I am old enough to remember a lot of things, including “whites only” water fountains, school bussing, &amp; lots of “routine” racist comments &amp; actions — where people that should have known better &amp; been better — didn’t object.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I’ve never even though about wearing blackface — the idea horrifies me. I heard old family members talk about the “good” intentions of the old Klan. Even as a young child, it sounded like crap to me.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I’m originally from Memphis, Tennessee. My parents were sharecroppers. I grew up as an Air Force brat, moving in and out of the deep south, between one more diverse community to much more acrimoniously racist communities.
@SurfCityWriter @fordm I’m unclear what you think we disagree about?

@DHamamdjian Do we know that she actually claimed that she was a police officer, and to whom? It is a curiosity to me, though not necessarily of any real importance.

@bitkahuna @greta You mean don’t trust that your employer, the government of the United States, when they say they will pay you for work you’ve done? It’s not like they work for Trump Organozation, or a Trump casino.
@GregHoffman13 @greta He’s the one that said he wouldn’t compromise at all. He’s also the one Mitch McConnell “blamed” when he said he wouldn’t bring the previous (unanimously passed) bill, or any other, to the floor, bc Trump wouldn’t sign it.
@SheilaC98106887 @greta Ask Paul Ryan and the GOP, who had complete control for the last two years, and failed to submit it in September, as they were supposed to do.
@wvusparky @greta Tmw your second statement proves the opposite of the first.
@62jerseygirl @greta Actually, no one recommends it, except people that work for Trump &amp; the racists that embrace this stupid idea.
@KspitzeKelli @dougiefresh1218 @greta Working at the IRS is not a “cause,” but a job. “Volunteering” at the IRS is also illegal.
@dougiefresh1218 @TheYankeeMan @greta Also, the House, under Pelosi, voted numerous times on bills; the Senate refused to even vote on the bill they’d approved unanimously just weeks ago. Trump refused to compromise, until he caved.
@MarkSLong2 @uzererr @greta @CNN You’d rather? This is why you’re not a journalist. Because a journalist does their homework. They knew the grand jury was meeting Thursday, and they staked out his house. Stone himself said he expected to be arrested. Greta used to be better than this.

Such a reaction could happen after a wholely-appropriate investigation &amp; finding. (Plaintiffs also commit suicide, as I’m sure you know.)  7/
@RickDoyle @Castantine @JohnnyGWeir They, &amp; the public, are left with unanswered, &amp; unanswerable questions. I sympathize with them. 		If SafeSport acted outside the bounds, that should be fully addressed by the governing body. His reaction virtually assured a review, though not necessarily an unbiased  one. 6/

@RickDoyle @Castantine @JohnnyGWeir He was apparently represented by an attorney, &amp; I would’ve expected them to raise the issue of venue, if he felt SafeSport was acting outside their purview, or if he had not been given an opportunity 2 defend himself before the investigation was complete. Wouldn’t you? 4/
@RickDoyle @Castantine @JohnnyGWeir In this case, it appears he chose (but was not obligated) to talk about the claims, but unless I missed it, it didn’t look like he was saying they were not the appropriately-designated entity 2 conduct an investigation. 3/

@Glitchy_Ashburn @ByronTau Or more uncaring. My impression of the young man staring at them was that he was aware the cameras were on him. He did it exactly for that purpose. Daring them to object.
@sfreligh @CatholicCincy The political power of the Bishops and the Catholic Church. Add an immoral man like Trump to sign legislation lifting restrictions on churches, &amp; it gets worse and worse.
@victorlams @DecentFilms @dlongenecker1 Or maybe he should be more observant, since he’s obviously missed seeing them. Or maybe he shouldn’t encourage negative stereotypes based on his own biases, and then call it a “joke.” If you have to explain it, it’s not a “joke.”
@NDdecks @JamesMartinSJ To paraphrase the pragmatic Dr. Joycelyn Elders: Some people aren’t really “pro-life,” but “pro-fetus.” They love a fetus, but once it’s born, it’s a different story.
Wonder how that whole #BeBest thing is going... https://t.co/xjuvfTAXWl
@cedteaches @aldotcom Oh, wow. Wouldn’t happen to be a certain fiddler, would it? Someone who, like Trump, is too skeered of his constituents to face them, but loves blocking them?  He’s the worst. And that’s saying something.
Priceless! When you see vases that look like urns flying off the shelves, you’ll know why. https://t.co/8Io24bToxg
@RickDoyle @JohnnyGWeir Any org. charged with investigating is going to be looking into the actions of someone that is liked by aomeone. When to realease information (early or later), and how much to release, is difficult to balance. No org. would satisfy everyone. Only hindsight is perfect.
@RickDoyle @JohnnyGWeir Sounds like no way will make people happy. If someone *does* abuse others &amp; is *not* put on interim suspension when being investigated &amp; that comes out later, all hell will break loose.

@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC All this reminds me of an old Clint Black song. “We tell ourselves that what we’ve found is what we’re looking for.” 		A lot of this looks to me  like cowardice.  I miss courage. 😢
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I know some “evangelicals” that feel the same way.  But they knew who he was. No one mistook him for a Christian. Some won’t speak up. A few do. When it’s all over, I think a lot will claim their hands were clean.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC That’s been especially hurtful to some vets, like me, to see fellow vets embrace him. Utterly devoid of honor, integrity, our “code.” Never leave a buddy behind. Never betray one. Or a POW. Or a GS family. It’s the worst you can be. The worst.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Like fake patriots, embracing a man that spits on vets, spits on female vets, POWs, Gold Star families. Even if you could “get” being against the Vietnam war, as a lot of ppl were, DJT is the other end of the spectrum. He didn’t oppose *it*, just *him*  going to fight it.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I just can’t abide the ludicrous hypocrisy. I remember reading about white people, like pastors, who marched, registered ppl to vote, often putting their own lives//reps/fortunes on the line. Where were they when racists attacks on Obama were *everywhere*?
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC They outed themselves, then had a fit when people noticed the distinctly racist flavor of theirs shrieks. The overlapping “evangelicals” were kicking Boy Scouts out of their churches for accepting gay kids. But not a word on racism &amp; $$ spent on wars ad nauseum.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Then, they show up with pics of Obama as a witch doctor, with a bone through his nose. Or him as a Nazi. Or a monkey. It’s permanently imprinted on my brain. So, so telling though.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I guess I’m reluctant to buy into the idea they were duped. Certainly not when the tea party showed up. If they didn’t see it before, that was a clue. Remember how they said they were all about the “fiscal accountability,” not really into social issues?
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Sorry, I see you were referring to my statement. I don’t think they were duped. They were still happy to hang on when the clown car left the road. They chose that. Resisted the signs &amp; alarms. Too few of them bailed after seeing the light.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC I don’t give much credit to the guys that now say they were duped. They knew, or should have known. The same guys blame their wives for their own bad behavior. The women blame other women that don’t share their views. They preach responsibility, except when it matters.

@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC What always frustrated me was that it seemed obvious that many of these so-called patriots/Christians/etc. were faking it, but saying so was &amp; still is “risky.” Like being afraid 2 “offend”  the abusive family member is okay. Drives me nuts.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC But even I’ve been somewhat surprised. And no one seems to want Fox News on the TV in the waiting room. Ha!  I should say that I’m almost always surrounded by vets older than I am, &amp; almost all male. So, not a scientific survey, by any means.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC Btw: a surprising number of convos at the VA have been about this very thing. I’ve had some surprises, tho I’ve always known that not all vets were Republicans, as some believe. We are not a solid bloc.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC What used to be called “patriotic” looks different from the other side of the looking glass.  		Deep down, I think they still recognize what they see. But can’t save face *now* &amp; admit that. 		That’s my most generous read, at least. But still awful. 😞
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC There’s probably been several different reasons, lots of “wtf” moments, for some of these folks. But at some point they realized they were so far in, there  was no way out. They **needed** the next step &amp; the money to get there. They can be “patriots” by redefining it.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC It’s like they were being served bigger portions of more powerful drugs, and they felt invincible. And then Trump showed up. They all did a double take, then laughed. The Tea Party became “Freedom Caucus.” But the hook was set. By then, they’d sold their soul for the drug.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC With the FRC, the NRA, the Bishops &amp; Baptist Convention &amp; all of the propagandists of Fox &amp; talk radio pushing the message like it came from God himself, it was easy to slide by, with little to no actual accomplishments. It was too easy. So they got cocky.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC It was so easy for them, in part, to believe that bc they’d gotten by for so long w/o having to show *any* real work for quite some time. Just mention “morality,” “the unborn,” or “protect ourselves,” &amp; ppl “forgot” they didn’t actually DO things.
@Karoli @NicoleBelle @JoyAnnReid @LindseyGrahamSC At the height of their conceit, they really did think they’d be the sole survivors. They believed they could outsmart others, suck up the money (NRA), &amp; continue to get by, doing nothing to rein in  the evil.

@johnlin59 @HappyPete55 @forthepatrie @historBilia @thehill Even Scalia believed that the 2nd amendment was not any weapon, anywhere, by anyone. How does the background check “limit” your rights?
@blytheiam @Wolvertans @HappyPete55 @forthepatrie @historBilia @thehill Exactly. Responsible gun owners don’t leave them around for kids to find and shoot someone. Sadly, too many people want the “right” to own one, without accepting any of the “responsibility.”

@Connectionary @HappyPete55 @forthepatrie @historBilia @thehill Do you plan to exterminate the “criminals, mentally ill, and clueless morons?” If not (and that would be illegal and immoral), background checks are a good first step to ensuring they don’t get to buy guns. Closing loopholes further would also help.
@historBilia @JordanKornmann @HappyPete55 @forthepatrie @thehill Right? Apparently, it’s their inability to read and comprehend how background checks are designed to keep the wrong people from getting guns. They immediately go to the bunker-building mentality of an NRA fanatacist.
@CMJohnston22 @historBilia @HappyPete55 @forthepatrie @thehill So you’re okay with the mentally ill and felons owning guns? Bc that’s who background checks are aimed at. How does that endanger you?

@politico It’s hard to overstate how ridiculous this is, but the “we talked to nearly half a dozen people” (Is that 4? Or 5?) line is revealing. You started with  “compare Hillary’s ‘unlikability’ with Elizabeth’s” &amp; that IS the crux of the problem. We’re not doing that crap again.

@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Just as we wouldn’t be okay with excluding a disabled person from leadership, neither do I think we should dismiss a woman, or a woman who some see as “old.” Newer doesn’t always mean better.
@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Are you talking about this race for the Dem. caucus leader? Do any members of the caucus fit that description? Offhand, I can’t think of any members who are disabled, except for Sen. Tammy Duckworth. I’m sure there are others, but this is the House we’re talking about.
@7bestoftimes @freeandclear1 @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Being empathetic and compassionate is great, but does not necessarily fulfill the needs of a leadership role. When did we start playing the “stay in your (old) lane” as the “identity politics” we’re okay with?
@7bestoftimes @freeandclear1 @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier So bc you “no longer need to lead,” you think a blanket hand-off should be enforced. You completely disregard any possibility that younger, less-experienced ppl are right for all leadership roles? Curious at what age would u cut them off? What is “old” to you?
@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Knowing what we know, I think it is ridiculously silly to ignore that ageism and sexism are still alive well, as is just discounting that it might have been an influence. Blasting “old people” for wanting to use their earned &amp; valuable experience makes no sense.
@freeandclear1 @7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier Not sure about that, but she seems to be saying that because he’s younger, the right candidate won. So now we’re advocating for older women to be sidelined, simply because they have stuck around, gaining experience and expertise, despite all the obstacles. Seems nuts &amp; spiteful.
@7bestoftimes @scottwongDC @RepSpeier You saw him on TV, and he was “most impressive,” you say. But you don’t know what went on behind closed doors in the vote, which is what she’s addressing. FYI, we’re taking about the Dem. caucus, not the youth league. Experience matters. A lot.
@7bestoftimes @jmichaelkell @RyuRhodes @freeandclear1 @caragal_ @scottwongDC @RepSpeier You said you want to see the end of “identity politics,” but ageism &amp; sexism are exactly that. You say “old” people need to step aside. So, you’re okay w/ that kind of identity politics. Um, okay.

@TexasTribune @Walmart @AsaHutchinson @lrsd And the politicians in the pockets of @walmart &amp; the Walton family, put in complete control by an election, blame teachers, ignore causes/results of poverty, allow charters/private schools 2 take resources from public schools w/o same standards.
@TexasTribune @Walmart He, an appointee of Gov. @AsaHutchinson, was unqualified 4 the job, so they lowered the standards so he could take the job. Then he took over @lrsd, refuses 2 return it to local control, but he’s not “improving” it. But they won’t hold chargers 2 same standards.
@TexasTribune He’s right. Just look @ Arkansas, where the state’s largest school district was taken over by the state, wiping out the duly-elected board, &amp; put in the hands of 1 man, intent on charterizing/privatizing public schools as Walton (@walmart) money wants.

@radfemfatale Also, the underwear in both these cases would be preserved in evidence bags, and only handled by professionals, like CSIs, etc. Not by victims or lawyers. This is just sick.
@radfemfatale The rape victim shield laws I referenced above help protect victims. They don’t keep defense from casting some aspersions on victim, but it’s a thin line they have to walk. Plus, juries here are more likely to turn on them for doing that to a victim.
@radfemfatale I realize you may not know the answers to all my questions, but I’m trying to understand. I am horrified. Even here in the U.S. w/ dismal rates of successful prosecution of rape, a judge would never allow a defense lawyer to force a victim to hold up her underwear.
@radfemfatale I’m just gobsmacked by this. Awful!! Is a 4 year sentence for rape the usual? That seems so short! Was it bc he was a juvenile at the time? Does Ireland put teen offenders in juvenile lockup, or prison? Are there no rape victim “shield laws” in Ireland, like in U.S.?

@georgelittledc @john_sipher @MaxBoot He. Made. The. Choice. To sell his honor, his reputation, his dignity, to serve as a prop for a corrupt &amp; dishonorable man. When he trashed a U.S. Congresswoman &amp; the widow of a fallen soldier, he made it clear what he’s become.
@georgelittledc @cherokeesher2 He could quit &amp; refuse to be a party to the misuse of our troops for political gain, &amp; to the dishonor Trump brings to his office  &amp; the country Kelly &amp; his son served. He, more than anyone except maybe Mattis, knows what dishonor looks like. But he stays.
