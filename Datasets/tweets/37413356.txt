@lisastoi @jj_fedigan Are you a member of American intelligence? Do you really think that the President and Secretary of State  wouldn't know if KJU had direct involvement in Otto's torture? KJU is barely hanging on.
@RosaYanarates @jj_fedigan No, I rely on evidence. If you know something I don't, then please share.		Otherwise, we're all dupes of the WMD hoaxes that have kept us at war in other places for decades now.
@jj_fedigan Like I said, Trump brought Otto home. We don't know if KJU was involved. Our President stated he is going to take KJU's statement at face value. When leaders fail to do that and apply guilt without supporting evidence, they start wars.

@KappelmanErik @RandPaul One doesn't need credentials to write books on a topic (and still be non-fiction). :) A fresh graduate, for example, is likely to regurgitate what their instructors fed them with until they've lived a bit. And the greedy ones have a slanted perspective.
@KappelmanErik @RandPaul Yes, my "RRs" come in handy. :) Ron Paul, also a physician, is Rand's daddy. Ron Paul authored the book, and the movement in my POV. Observing the criminals and their grip over masses over decades sealed it. I recommend you give it a read, and then fully or partially debunk it 🤷🏽‍♀️

@waronwankers To one with blinders on, then yes, your tweet makes sense.  Negotiation 101 covers the concept of give and take. He's offered lots so far - even more yesterday.  So while you and your across the pond heroes continue to keep those blinders on, the govt will stay shut.
@waronwankers "Under Senate rules, any senator can ask for consent to vote on or pass a bill, but any senator can object." McConnell has voiced that any funding bill presented must include negotiation btwn Dems &amp; POTUS. Dems aren't negotiating, as I've stated before. *We don't do Parliament :)

@JasonHornbuckle You want me to compare a grown woman's murder case to a trafficked kid's? Ok, why did Cyntoia Brown serve more time?
@JasonHornbuckle Why am I here?	https://t.co/fTv0aMu2hR
@JasonHornbuckle Raise up these cases, then. You have to start somewhere. There are so many people (non-celebs, don't worry) working towards criminal justice reform.
@JasonHornbuckle It's because people squabble over situations like this that the big fish get away with mass murder. Punch upward, friend. 		Also, get to know more local activists. They knew Cyntoia before the celebs got involved. (I'm grateful they lent their platform).
@JasonHornbuckle "Brown will now be released on parole supervision on August 7, 2019, after serving 15 years in prison."		You still don't see that she has paid a due to society? Or are we back to anarchy again?
@JasonHornbuckle You just said this: 	https://t.co/P6T8Mwxo1c
@JasonHornbuckle Uh, he is independently wealthy/$$ secure. He had nothing to gain here but goodwill. In fact, he even placed a lengthy probationary requirement.
@JasonHornbuckle Thank you for your concern. 		A handful of clemency cases isn't going to take us into anarchy. If you fear anarchy in Tennessee, why not take your concerns up with Gov. Haslam? Don't you think he reviewed the whole case before making this decision? Come on. :)

@JasonHornbuckle You compared what you were doing at ages 16 and 17 to this girl, and in doing so, based your sense of morality and "justice" on your personal experience. I recognize that sexual abuse/trauma impacts psychological development. I place most of the culpability on the adults here.
@JasonHornbuckle Then thank the heavens that you were blessed with the capacity, maturity, and freedom from predatory bondage at an *earlier* age.
@JasonHornbuckle Person C points back to Person A, however. Both were adults in literal control of an underaged person. 		*Murder is wrong. Both Person A and Person C should have been imprisoned for their crimes. Due to her age and the situation in which the crime occurred, I agree w/the clemency
@JasonHornbuckle Celebs caught on to a case that many others non-celebs had already been advocating for. I think amplifying certain causes using their platforms is a powerful tool, especially since executive clemency is rare.
@JasonHornbuckle I ask that you step back and think about what you wrote. "A kid" and "pimp" should not exist, anywhere.  That's already a huge extenuating circumstance w/regards to her crime in my book.
@JasonHornbuckle No, there's no rule.
