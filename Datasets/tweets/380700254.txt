Don't even know how I made it through today without going completely off my rocker
I look beyond ugly today so please no one look at me and we can pretend this day never happened
Well atleast with all the procrastinating I do I've learned to work well under high pressure if I even need to deactivate a bomb or anything
BYE HOMEWORK BYE 👋
If we call attractive people hot shouldn't we call ugly people cold?
Lol at @Jauch_95 busting his shit getting outta my car
Whenever I see a car with my schools sticker I always creep to see if I know whose driving 😳
