Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own (and indeed Allâh answered their invocation by sending Muhammad Peace be upon him ), who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book (this Qur'ân) and Al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islâmic law
Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our Manâsik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage - Hajj and 'Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.
And (remember) when Ibrâhim (Abraham) and (his son) Ismâ'il (Ishmael) were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka'bah at Makkah), (saying), "Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."
Those (who embraced Islâm from Banî Israel) to whom We gave the Book [the Taurât (Torah)] [or those (Muhammad's Peace be upon him companions) to whom We have given the Book (the Qur'ân)] recite it (i.e. obey its orders and follow its teachings) as it should be recited (i.e. foll
were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Qur'ân), then you would have against Allâh neither any Walî (protector or guardian) nor any helper.
Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ) till you follow their religion. Say: "Verily, the Guidance of Allâh (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him )
Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ) with the truth (Islâm), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, they will enter the Hell-fire). And
And those who have no knowledge say: "Why does not Allâh speak to us (face to face) or why does not a sign come to us?" So said the people before them words of similar import. Their hearts are alike, We have indeed made plain the signs for people who believe with certainty.
The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : "Be!" - and it is.
And to Allâh belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allâh (and He is High above, over His Throne). Surely! Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knowing.
For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.
And who are more unjust than those who forbid that Allâh's Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in Allâh's mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allâh's Mosques) except in fear. For them
The Jews said that the Christians follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); and the Christians said that the Jews follow nothing (i.e. are not on the right religion); though they both recite the Scripture. Like unto their word, said (the pagans) who know not. Allâh wil
Yes, but whoever submits his face (himself) to Allâh (i.e. follows Allâh's Religion of Islâmic Monotheism) and he is a Muhsin then his reward is with his Lord (Allâh), on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. [See Tafsir Ibn Kathîr].
And they say, "None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian." These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ), "Produce your proof if you are truthful."
And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât, and whatever of good (deeds that Allâh loves) you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allâh. Certainly, Allâh is All-Seer of what you do.
upon him is Allâh's Messenger) has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allâh brings His Command. Verily, Allâh is Able to do all things.
Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad Peace be upon him is Allâh's Messenger
Or do you want to ask your Messenger (Muhammad Peace be upon him ) as Mûsa (Moses) was asked before (i.e. show us openly our Lord?) And he who changes Faith for disbelief, verily, he has gone astray from the Right Way.
Know you not that it is Allâh to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? And besides Allâh you have neither any Walî (protector or guardian) nor any helper.
Whatever a Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allâh is able to do all things
chooses for His Mercy whom He wills. And Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.
Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) nor Al-Mushrikûn (the idolaters, polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh, pagans, etc.) like that there should be sent down unto you any good from your Lord. But Allâh chooses
O you who believe! Say not (to the Messenger Peace be upon him ) Râ'ina but say Unzurna (make us understand) and hear. And for the disbelievers there is a painful torment. (S

They followed what the Shayâtin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulaimân (Solomon). Sulaimân did not disbelieve, but the Shayâtin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two (angels,) Hârût and Mârût,
And when there came to them a Messenger from Allâh (i.e. Muhammad Peace be upon him ) confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw away the Book of Allâh behind their backs as if they did not know!
Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throw it aside? Nay! (the truth) is most of them believe not.
And indeed We have sent down to you manifest Ayât (these Verses of the Qur'ân which inform in detail about the news of the Jews and their secret intentions, etc.), and none disbelieve in them but Fâsiqûn (those who rebel against Allâh's Command).
Whoever is an enemy to Allâh, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibrael (Gabriel) and Mikael (Michael), then verily, Allâh is an enemy to the disbelievers."
Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him ): "Whoever is an enemy to Jibrael (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur'ân) down to your heart by Allâh's Permission, confirming what came before it [i.e. the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and
And verily, you will find them (the Jews) the greediest of mankind for life and (even greedier) than those who ascribe partners to Allâh (and do not believe in Resurrection - Majus, pagans, and idolaters). Everyone of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years.
But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent before them (i.e. what they have done). And Allâh is All-Aware of the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers)
Say to (them): "If the home of the Hereafter with Allâh is indeed for you specially and not for others, of mankind, then long for death if you are truthful."
[93] وَإِذ أَخَذنا ميثٰقَكُم وَرَفَعنا فَوقَكُمُ الطّورَ خُذوا ما ءاتَينٰكُم بِقُوَّةٍ وَاسمَعوا ۖ قالوا سَمِعنا وَعَصَينا وَأُشرِبوا فى قُلوبِهِمُ العِجلَ بِكُفرِهِم ۚ قُل بِئسَما يَأمُرُكُم بِهِ إيمٰنُكُم إِن كُنتُم مُؤمِنينَ
And indeed Mûsa (Moses) came to you with clear proofs, yet you worshipped the calf after he left, and you were Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).
And when it is said to them (the Jews), "Believe in what Allâh has sent down," they say, "We believe in what was sent down to us." And they disbelieve in that which came after it, while it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say (O Muhammad Peace be upon him to them): "Why
How bad is that for which they have sold their ownselves, that they should disbelieve in that which Allâh has revealed (the Qur'ân), grudging that Allâh should reveal of His Grace unto whom He wills of His slaves. So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath. And for the
And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur'ân) from Allâh confirming what is with them [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked Allâh (for coming of Muhammad Peace be upon him
Those are they who have bought the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their torment shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped.
And they say, "Our hearts are wrapped (i.e. do not hear or understand Allâh's Word)." Nay, Allâh has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is that which they believe.
And indeed, We gave Mûsa (Moses) the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave 'Īsā (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear signs and supported him with Rûh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel) A.S.]. Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what
After this, it is you who kill one another and drive out a party of you from their homes, assist (their enemies) against them, in sin and transgression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. Then do you believe inpart
And (remember) when We took your covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your (people), nor turn out your own people from their dwellings. Then, (this) you ratified and (to this) you bear witness.

আমি সবার কারো একার নয়. হোক  সে যে কেউ. সবাই এক পথের পথিক .কি? কেউ মানে কেউ মানে না.। কথা কি ভুল.
যদি অজানা কাউকে আঘাত করে থাকি তো কমা করবেন সবাই
সবাই সবার জন্য সবাই ভাল থাকবেন এই কামনায় নদর্ মার কিট
কিছু সময় তোমাদের

আপনাকে অনেক অনেক ধন্যবাদ। মনের কথা ও মুখের কথা চোখ দেখলেই বোঝা মা জননী। সবার সাথৃ নিয়ে এগিয়ে যান সেবক হয়ে https://t.co/qkZZmXhoqz
ধন্যবাদ সবাই কে।নিজে বাঁছুন অন্যকে বাঁছান।দেশ বাঁছান দেশের জনগন বাঁছান।একে অনের্ পাশে দাঁড়াই ও সেবা করি https://t.co/fnacrcB1qL
অচেনা পাখি সব সময় খুজে নিরের ঠিকানা।যে ডালে বাসা বাধে সেই ডালটা হঠাৎ ঝর এসে ভেঙে দেয় আবার চুটে ঘড় বাধার আসায় এদিক ওদিক। পাবে কি নিড়

আমাদের শরীর এক হাত দুই পা দুই চোখ দুই। আর মুখ এক। কি আর কিছু।আমার এসব শুনে শুনে অভ্যাস হয়ে গেছে।আমি আমিই চ্যালেঞ্জ।
thanks to all every body. good by good night. Allah helped all female member. amen
যত দুশ ননদ লাল ঘোষ।এই আছি এই নেই চলি বল পালাই পালাই। কিছুই না আনডা
সময় কারো জন্য অপেক্ষা করে না বরং সবাই কে সময়ের জন্য অপেক্ষা করতে হয়। সময় এক ভাবে কখনো যায় না কারো যেমন সবার বেলায় এমন।

কেউ কারো মত নয়। মানুষ মানুষের জন্য জীবন জীবনের জন্য। একটু সহানুভূতি কি মানুষ পেতে পারে না।
জীবন কখনো হাসায় কখনো কাদায়ঁ কখনো অভিমানে দু চোখ ভাসায়। এরি নাম জীবন
