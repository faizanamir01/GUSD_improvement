@model_daughters They also may feel a sense of jealousy because you had a relationship with your mom that they didn’t.  It’s complicated, and not yours to fix. Just take care of yourself and be good to yourself.
@model_daughters Sometimes grief makes people turn on loved ones. They also feel tremendous guilt for not doing their part, but it’s easier to just be angry. But you have to put your own well being first and shut them out for now.  Self care and protection.
@CNN I hope Biden beats his ass behind that metaphorical dumpster.  Trump truly is hot trash.

@realDonaldTrump We need a new President, a slightly smarter and less orange version. God I miss the O’bamas.
@realDonaldTrump Their wall won’t cost taxpayers billions of dollars for a false sense of security. Their wall won’t be placed on land that would be altered by the fence.  There is also no rivers running through their land.  They pay for their own fence. It’s not interfering with others land.
@realDonaldTrump And their fence isn’t to keep “illegals” out.  It’s simply to keep photographers/tourists at bay.  They also aren’t interested in taking water away and killing those who are trying to seek asylum.  Lastly, they didn’t promise another country would pay for it.
