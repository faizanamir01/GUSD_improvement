@ChrisPack716 @USATODAY I'm saying if you asked AOC or any other House Democrat if they actually believed the world is going to end in 12 years, I don't believe they'd say yes.
@ChrisPack716 I don't think that quote means what you think it means, not that it's a particularly artful sentence.

@NextLAMayor @StefenEQ @michaelshure FWIW, AOC is testing your theory, with the minimum staff salary in her office being $52,000, but because there is so little money in her MRA, that means senior staff makes no more than $80,000, which also carries its own problems.

Looking at this list, it's clear how outrageous it is that junior congressional staffers get paid so little.		I'm guessing that, with an additional $100,000 in every office, you could make sure no staffer is paid less than $50,000. That's $54 million—or, like, one project here.
Democrats on the Hill have been circulating a list of 400 potential military construction projects that could be affected by Trump's national emergency declaration. https://t.co/iwrXDeQLPs

George pretends he got rich off of cryptocurrency to attract a woman. The IRS then suspects he’s hiding the money to avoid taxation.		“Oh yeah? Well the joke’s on you! I don’t have a dime to my name!” George confesses to the IRS agent, just as his love interest enters the room.

@plbernstein92 Treaty of Madrid is from 1891. That’s the first treaty dealing with “Champagne.” Versailles then codifies and expands that agreement. 		The U.S. signed Versailles, but the Senate never ratified it, so we operated under some murky international law for 80+ years.
Just spent a little time reading tweets about this — which mostly get the facts wrong — and a couple articles about it. 		This was the best story on it: https://t.co/yk3v3yxAP2
@plbernstein92 We catch Rob Lowe’s character explaining that Champagne has to come from “Champagne,” otherwise it’s just sparkling wine.
Anyway, I thought that was interesting and I tweet for me no one is making me tweet stuff like this.
Except, U.S. trade negotiators secured a concession allowing U.S. winemakers already marketing their sparkling as “Champagne” to continue. 		Hence, we have stuff like “André California Champagne.”
So some American wineries were calling their sparkling “Champagne” with impunity for decades — many of the lower-end winemakers, in fact — until we agreed to end that practice in a 2005 trade deal.
An agreement to only call wines from Champagne, France, “Champagne” is from the Treaty of Versailles — “Actually” first appears in the Treaty of Madrid — but the U.S. Senate didn’t ratify the Treaty of Versailles.
Contrary to Wayne’s World, the term “Champagne” *can* be used to describe sparkling wine outside of Champagne *if* the winery was using the term before March 10, 2006.
Discovered my new favorite “Actually...” tonight.		It involves wine, global politics, trade agreements, and the famous Rob Lowe “Actually” in Wayne’s World.

@noonanjo So...two “good questions” and you managed to answer neither of them.
@noonanjo How much ~secret~ spending should we assume? Want me to spot you $100 billion?
Hello, John.		Thought I might find you here.		While we’re comparing current spending to JFK’s tenure, what were the tax rates were back then?

A majority of Republicans just voted against a bill Trump is supposed to sign tonight.		https://t.co/FubKvQmzI0
@TakeBackUsa2018 Republicans got what they wanted. Democrats didn't. You tell me who failed on that one.
House passes the funding bill 300-128, with 109 Republicans voting no, 19 Democrats voting no, 87 Republicans voting yes, and 213 Democrats voting yes.		They were well short of a majority of Republican votes, and Democrats didn’t get to 218. They needed Republican votes.
Dem leadership is out in the back, looking for members they can flip so they can get 218 votes on their own.		Mildly important for their future negotiating position that they can say they had the votes to pass this themselves without GOP votes.
A majority of Republicans are gonna vote no on this spending deal. Democrats also aren’t going to get to 218 votes on this. 		Leadership from both parties kinda muddling their message on the victory, but particularly Republicans. Trump isn’t gonna love that many GOP no votes.
Folks, looks pretty certain that a majority of Republicans *will* vote no on this bill. That could give Trump some pause on signing this thing.		It also makes this look like a better deal for Democrats than it probably is.
Looking like a majority of Republicans *could* vote no on this, which would be a little shocking.
Currently more Republican noes than there are Republican yeas. 55-56
Right now, it’s looking more like the dozen-ish Dem noes and 60 Republican noes.		Current tally is 129-29, with 6 Dems and 23 Republicans voting no.
Alright. We’re voting in the House on the funding bill.		This is one I think we’ll spend some time reviewing as some ~paradigm of ideological purity~ for both parties.
Bit of a feeling here in the House that there may be more Democratic no votes than we first expected on this funding bill. 		Could be more in the 20-30 range rather than single digits to a dozen.

I’d also tell you that, in my mind, Walter Jones was the last fiscal hawk in Congress.		He was the only Republican to vote against the tax bill over spending concerns.		Every single other Republican is posturing.
Anyway, Walter Jones was a man who voted his conscience in Congress, not his party — or, at least, he tried. He’d tell you that he often failed.		We could use a lot more of that in Congress, and I don’t think I’ll see another one like Walter Jones in my lifetime.
Walter Jones famously changed his mind about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he was very open for years that his biggest regret in life was voting to authorize those wars.		Republicans wouldn’t let him have an Armed Services subcommittee chairmanship because he spoke out.
We had a long chat about his career one night, and at some point, he started talking about why he cared about veterans.		Through tears, Jones told me he came to Congress and discovered that his grandfather was gassed in the Argonne Forest in WWI and eventually killed himself.
We just lost another good Congressman: Walter Jones.		Years ago, I wondered who the Congressman was who crossed party lines the most. By a long shot, it was Jones. He voted for every Dem motion that benefitted veterans, and he was happy to pay the price.		https://t.co/CZhyjwSreN

Sports are cool because, when you’re a kid, they teach you that you aren’t the best and you can’t do whatever you set your mind to. And when you’re old, sports show you that you’re deteriorating, that you’re slowly dying.		Sports: The deliverer of inconvenient but poignant truth.

Trump is uniquely bad at this.
Quite honestly, even I didn’t think Trump would leave himself with *no* cover for caving. I thought he’d at least declare a national emergency.		Democrats aren’t going to give him a wall in three weeks, so he maybe still does that, but why live through this embarrassment today?

I was told Donald Trump was playing chess and Nancy Pelosi was playing checkers...		🤔
@notthatready @econwonk Eh. I’m not sure anyone even cares about spending anymore. One vote to “raise” spending versus several votes, and I do think this storyline would of constraining spending would become pretty mainstream.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 I’m probably not as sympathetic to that as I should be, but I still don’t think anyone is taking future shutdowns seriously enough.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 I’m telling you, there’d be a supplemental.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 If I were at an agency right now, I’d take guaranteed paychecks for the rest of Trump’s first term.
@notthatready @econwonk Rhetorically, yes, but in effect, no. Congress, like always, is not living by BCA caps.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 And agencies would be wise to take guaranteed funding whenever they can get it at this point. (Again, The Appropriations Committee probably then focuses on a supplemental, so this becomes more like an auto-CR deal for two years.)
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 I mean, yeah, not happening, but this is where my mind wandered to at a bar with a bunch of mourning journalists.
@econwonk I’d prob do 02/01/2021, so a new President is in office, and because that date looks tight as hell.
@MattGlassman312 @joshHuder So the real result is you get an omnibus supplemental every year — thus why Dems do it — but it takes shutdown off the table.
@StevenTDennis And thus, retaining their services for the next two years is irrelevant. An actual way to drain the swamp.
@econwonk Zach, come on, the caps deal is included in this at continuing fiscal 19 levels.
@joshHuder Josh, this is Congress, I can fix that problem in less than a page of legislative text. (The caps deal is just a continuation of defense and non-defense spending at fiscal 19 levels.)
This idea — which, again, is not happening — would have an added “drain the swamp” effect.		I imagine lobbyists would *hate* not having new spending bills for two years (unless their job is to block new riders, in which case, enjoy your vacation). https://t.co/HWXsBbJpgQ
@CapeCodder2012 Good point, though a lot of them are also interested in constraining Dem riders that’ll now pass the House.
@MattDennis1 Write the caps deal into the CR (as an extension of current spending for defense and non-defense).
Republicans would also get to brag about constraining spending and the Dem House majority, (though I bet there’d be a big push for a defense supplemental), and Democrats would get government funded for a long time with no wall fight.		Essentially, both sides win and lose.
I had this idea last night, and it’s not gonna happen, but it’s a fun thought-experiment:		A two-year continuing resolution.		Democrats wouldn’t like it because it’d limit the bills where they could make new law — same for some Rs — but it’d end shutdown threat under Trump.

I know this is an agreement to take two failed votes, but am I missing something?		Isn’t it tougher on Senate Republicans to vote against a clean CR to reopen government than it is for Senate Dems to vote against wall money + immigration changes + government funding?

Trump has heard from Democrats on the Problem Solvers Caucus. That's pretty much it. They definitely didn't negotiate an immigration for border security deal.		This is all just wishful thinking and lying.

After the last 24 hours, maybe Trump decided he needs to stay on the good side of Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP.
The national emergency declaration to build the wall — which has looked like the most likely end to the shutdown for almost two weeks now — probably won’t accomplish what Trump wants.		But it gets everyone out of a shutdown without anyone having to concede.
Well, this could be it.		The assumption is he’d declare a national emergency, redirect money to a wall, and then Congress could pass clean funding bills.		Can’t say for sure though. The last time he did this it was to say Democrats are bad live from the Oval Office. https://t.co/wh20tox3XU

@ryanbeckwith @TalKopan Which is why a rational (political) decision would have been the national emergency declaration.		I've seen very little evidence that GOP support ever craters, no matter what he does.
@ryanbeckwith @TalKopan I don’t think it’s rational to only consider political implications, though that may be what he’s doing. I’d hope he considers, you know, people.		There’s also more to political implications than GOP support. Independents are cracking. His favorability is dipping into the 30s.
@TalKopan @ryanbeckwith These assumptions only work when government and the decision-makers are acting rationally.		Is the pain caused by this shutdown driving a deal? If not...
If House Democrats went this route with a *one-day* continuing resolution, I'd bet more than 20 Republicans — about double what they're getting on individual agency funding bills — would vote for it.		It would also highlight McConnell's obstinance, how pain is the point. https://t.co/dyDUpnfRAD
@jjstoller I guess. Pretty cool point, huh?
The whole idea of this shutdown is to make it painful for real people so one side cracks — a very cool and responsible way to govern — but you can lessen the pain and hold onto most of your "leverage," just saying.
@emilycrockett The contractors have been SOL for a long time on this and no one is doing anything to help them.

House passes a resolution against white nationalism (meant as a rebuke of Steve King), 424-1.		The only member to vote against it was Democrat Bobby Rush. He’s authored a much sterner rebuke of King in the form of a censure resolution. He wants a vote on that.
The House is voting on the resolution against white nationalism — supposed to serve as a proxy vote against Steve King — only the vote is currently unanimous. Even King is voting yes. Current tally 399-0.		I don’t think this will satisfy Democrats who want to censure King.

And I know I shouldn’t be surprised about Republicans being hypocrites when it comes to executive overreach — I know, I know — but man, even I expected a *little* more pushback at a move that would drastically limit Congress’s power of the purse.		Nope, they were on board!
I easily talked to 30 House Republicans last week about Trump maybe declaring a national emergency — kept on asking even after we pubbed this: https://t.co/h2ZSCyqMLs — and hardly any GOP lawmakers were actually going to oppose him doing it.		I bet 95% of ‘em would fall in line.
I certainly get ruling it out from a practical standpoint (would be tied up in the courts and wouldn’t result in construction), as well as an ideological one (it’s blatant executive overreach), but from a political angle, if it’s just about selling the fight to your base...
From a negotiating standpoint, Trump ruling out the national emergency route is such a mistake. It’s maybe the only way out of the shutdown that preserves him not compromising. And good chance there’s no deal here.		Then again, when has contradicting himself ever stopped Trump?

Louie Gohmert is not only a lawyer who took the LSAT, passed law school, passed the bar, and represented people in court.		Gohmert was a judge who has sentenced people to death.		And his argument for a border wall is that, if you don’t like walls, tear down your house’s walls. https://t.co/mYU1R2AOHO
Gohmert also has posters of Americans who were allegedly killed by undocumented immigrants.		My point is what passes for acceptable rhetoric agaunst immigration, and what’s beyond the pale, seems like a pretty thin line.
There was a rush of reporters to listen to Steve King’s floor speech, but it pretty much emptied out when he yielded back to Louie Gohmert.		Gohmert is currently talking about how, if you don’t believe walls work, you should “eliminate the walls in your house.”
Steve King says he regrets "the heartburn" that this is NYT report has caused for Congress and for Iowa, which is kind of like saying "I'm sorry you feel that way."
For a floor speech about how he's not racist, Steve King has clarified that he's *not* anti-immigrant — he's "anti-illegal immigrant," he said — and he's mentioned his support for "Western Civilization" a few times.
He's addressing the New York Times report.

@MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mls1776 @brfreed @mattngreen Opening line is four.
Nancy Pelosi elected Speaker.		Pelosi: 219	McCarthy: 192	Jordan: 5	Bustos: 4	Present: 3	Duckworth: 2	Abrams: 1	Fudge: 1	Biden: 1	Lewis: 1	Kennedy: 1	Murphy: 1	Massie: 1
@emilcDC Paul Tonko, I believe.
@MattGlassman312 @joshHuder @brfreed @CaseyBurgat @mattngreen I was prepared to go 12 if you counted "present" at 0.5.		You left points on the table.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 @brfreed @CaseyBurgat @mattngreen I'm still awarding 0.5 for present votes, so we were at 12 already even before Jeff Van Drew voted "No."
Jeff Van Drew votes "No."		Not sure how we count that one, but okay.
By my count, we have currently 11 Democrats who have voted for someone other than Nancy Pelosi, with na additional two Reps. who have voted "present."
@MattGlassman312 @brfreed @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen Ouch. And now we're just running up the score.		Live line is 13 after Slotkin present vote.
@MattGlassman312 @brfreed @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen 9.5 after Rose, with Spanberger left to go.
@MattGlassman312 @brfreed @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen I'm moving live line back down to 11.5.		Rice and Spanberger are the only two who I think are sure things, but we got Rose, Stevens, and some other folks coming up.
@MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen 7.5 now.		Live line is 12.5 (-110)		Man, I'd be sweating if I had that under right about now.
@brfreed @MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen Fool.
I should note he's sitting literally right behind Nancy Pelosi as she's elected Speaker.
Rep. Antonio Delgado is reading a children's book to three kids, with a fourth older kid who isn't his looking on from time to time.
By my count, six Democrats have voted for someone other than Pelosi, with one other Dem voting "present."		6.5 votes against Pelosi thus far.
@MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen By my count, we're at 5.5 votes.		Live line is 11.5 (-120).
Walter Jones not present to take his vote. (He's been sick.)		Another blow to the David M. Walker For Speaker campaign.
@JustinOArnold Keep an eye out for Fortnite dance moves.
For those keeping score, we have one "present" vote (Cooper), one for Biden (Brindisi), one for Duckworth (Crow), and two for Bustos (Cunningham and Golden).
@MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @joshHuder @mattngreen Live line is 9.5
Jason Crow goes with Tammy Duckworth.		Hey! She's in the Senate!
Jim Cooper goes with the "present" vote.		Colin Powell's support for speaker has really fallen apart.
Justin Amash votes for Thomas Massie.		Someone on the Republican side boos him.
Hakeem Jeffries, with the line of the day: “Democrats are down with N.D.P.”		(Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi)

@MattGlassman312 @mattngreen @joshHuder @CaseyBurgat Cooper didn’t go Powell last time. I think it’s fair odds at this point.
@MattGlassman312 @joshHuder @CaseyBurgat @mattngreen Can we set it at 8?
@MattGlassman312 @mattngreen @joshHuder @CaseyBurgat We really shoulda offered odds on various vote-getters.		Nancy Pelosi: 1:10,000	Kevin McCarthy: 1:8,000	Jim Jordan: 1:50	John Lewis: 1:2	Colin Powell: 2:1	Paul Ryan: 2:1	Jim Cooper: 3:1	James Mattis: 8:1	Barbara Lee: 32:1	Alcee Hastings: 400:1
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @mattngreen I was kinda hoping to catch a live line under when this adjusts to 15 (-110) early in the vote.		Would give me 20:1 on a bookend zone of 10-15.

@CaseyBurgat @MattGlassman312 @joshHuder @mattngreen Hold on here, I want official rules. (I’m making official rules.)		The over is 10 (-110), and present votes count for 0.5.

There actually was a way Trump could have gotten his wall.		Yes, he could’ve taken the immigration deal for $25 billion of wall funding in exchange for DACA. But he could’ve also been shrewder.		The GOP could’ve done this through reconciliation. He was too clueless to know that.

Alright. Another clarification: This vote could actually fail. Corker and Flake might not vote for it.		That’d be something.
Just to be clear, this is a vote on a motion to proceed. This vote will be fine. It only needs 50. The next vote — a motion to end debate — that needs 60 votes and it'll fail.
@APAndrewTaylor Just trying to tell the truth.
Well, the Senate is now voting. The vote will fail.		And then it'll be on House leaders to either recede in the House amendment to the CR, or to do nothing.		Paul Ryan is ending his speakership by having to choose between "the least he can do" or "the ABSOLUTE least he can do."

The House hasn’t closed a vote on this tax bill, it appears, because Kevin McCarthy hasn’t voted yet.		He’s doing a live Fox News hit about 20 yards from the House chamber.
If I were betting, I’d say House Republicans actually have the votes to pass their CR with wall money, but I wouldn’t put much on it.		So the Senate rejects it, the House (maybe?) passes the clean Senate bill, and then what? Veto?		Still a good chance we’re headed for a shutdown.
An underrated thing about Donald Trump's twitter is...how can anyone criticize your twitter as unprofessional now?

By the way, if any Republicans would just like to pass a clean CR and make Trump do something with it, this vote is your chance, I guess.
Annnnd we're now voting on appealing the ruling of the chair. Pelosi is trying to force a vote on a clean CR. Republicans are trying to kill the motion.		Doug Collins bangs the gavel. The House begins voting again. Rep. Billy Long says "Dilly Dilly!"		(He actually said that.)
Sen. Ron Johnson, you can thank Rep. Thomas Massie.		I guess your bill wasn't gouda 'nough. https://t.co/pl7Zz2WT6V
I’ll note here that about 80% of the Republicans have already left the chamber, and almost all the Democrats are here.
Pelosi is now offering a privileged motion to get a vote on a CR to keep government open.
@StevenTDennis @HouseInSession I assume they would not get consent. I'm sure there are plenty of Senators who'd like to take the vote on the wall now.
An interesting strategy that Democrats almost certainly won't take advantage of.		They could prevent a vote on the wall merely through a quorum call. (Practical effect would be slowing everything down, giving Republicans more time, and ultimately getting more GOP members here.) https://t.co/yZOVTdRqhr
@HouseInSession Does the Senate have the votes to strip it out? Couldn't they just have the vote fail, and then count on the House to withdraw their own amendment?
Don Young comes down to the well to yell at presiding officer Doug Collins.		"Next time you bang that damn gavel..." he says, mad about when Collins closed the vote.		"I don't care!" he says. "It's not fair."		(Not sure whether he was mad that he closed it too fast or too slow.)
So based on the current attendance for these roll call votes, there are 212 Republicans, and 177 Democrats. So the threshold to passage in the House is 195.		Republicans can only lose 17. And they only have a few hours to whip.		Again, and then what?
House Republicans think they'll be able to pass a CR with border wall money.		I'm not so sure. Still a lot of absences, and I doubt any Democrats vote for it. But let's say they do. Senate rejects the bill, and then what?		 Anyway, good plan.		https://t.co/wgK8TPpNBZ
Doing a little math here.		We had 380 members vote this morning. A two-thirds majority to override the veto would be 255. We have 171 Dems here, and could probably get another four. (Call it 175.)		You'd need 80 Republicans to override the veto. Not impossible.

@DougHeye I mean, it’s really not difficult to derive my prescriptions from the piece. Allow bills and amendments to get votes. If you’re gonna take offense to Obama’s slights, call out Trump’s. Don’t pass a tax reform that costs $1 trillion. Don’t propose cutting Medicaid by $834 billion.
@DougHeye Pre-baked? It was mostly written when I saw you. And this piece wasn’t so much on the speech as it was his entire speakership and career in Congress.		Standing up to Trump means real oversight. Real accountability. Act as a separate and co-equal branch. Don’t do his bidding.
@DougHeye For the record, I think my piece was fair. What was unfair was the years of giving Paul Ryan undue credit and the benefit of the doubt.		And if you want to talk about how Paul Ryan could have been better, it’s not hard to imagine my suggestions: Open process, stand up to Trump.

To think Republicans wouldn’t just strip the Yemen language from the rule and pass the farm bill within 4-24 hours later is the most legislatively naive statement I’ve seen in my near decade covering Congress.
Oh no! We can’t let the rule setting up debate for the farm bill fail just because it includes language blocking a vote on Yemen!		All farm programs would lapse and Congress would never finish the bipartisan, bicameral legislation that lawmakers have been working on for years!
I have a Democratic Congressman who voted for the rule blocking a Yemen vote in my mentions telling Twitter users that the farm bill would have failed if the rule went down.		This is either absolute stupidity or shameless lying.		The farm bill was always gonna be fine, folks.
@Call_Me_Dutch @_El_Mendoza Is that a fact, or a guess?		(No, the farm bill was not going to fail if the rule was rejected, and with 16 years in Congress, I’m pretty sure you know they could do another rule pretty quickly.)

Literally millions of lives are at stake in Yemen, and the House of Representatives won't even have a debate on our support for a Saudi-led coalition there.		https://t.co/hxQHIRXVzL
Democrats could have blocked Republicans from shutting down debate on Yemen, and even highlighted GOP attempts to turn off the War Powers Resolution.		Instead, five Democrats decided passing the farm bill today instead of tomorrow was more important.		https://t.co/hxQHIRXVzL
Collin Peterson, one of the five Dems who voted to block a vote on Yemen, says he doesn't know "a damn thing" about the war there.		Reminder: 85,000 children have died from starvation as a result of this war, 17 million Yemeni at risk of malnutrition.		https://t.co/hxQHIRXVzL

House passes the farm bill 369-47, with 44 Republicans and three Democrats opposed. (Earlier tweet had it flipped.)		So much heming and hawing over food stamp cuts that didn’t happen for a bill that passed with 88% support of the chamber.
@hbottemiller The farm bill is gonna pass.		Exclusive. Must credit.
@igorbobic This coming from a guy who makes Oscar host/WH chief of staff comparisons and has never once did a Mentos pinstripe/park bench tweet.
@15c3PO I didn’t *dunk* on him. I just pegged his ass harder than ever before.
This tweet was too good for the 10,687 people who saw it and *didn't* throw it a fave.		They didn't deserve this tweet.
And now Al Lawson is speaking in support of the farm bill.		My *guess* is Dutch Ruppersberger, a former ranking Democrat on Intelligence and longtime hawk, just wanted to support Saudi Arabia. The other four Dems didn't want to blow up the farm bill.
Collin Peterson — the Democrat who's managing floor debate on the farm bill and led the small group of Dems to support the rule with Yemen language — is wearing a pinstripe suit that looks like he sat on a freshly painted park bench and thought fast after popping a Mentos.
I've seen 3 of the f5 Democrats who voted for the farm bill rule blocking a Yemen vote speak on the floor in favor of the farm bill.		It's almost like they thought blocking the rule would have killed the farm bill. (It wouldn't have, it's just unbelievable shortsightedness.)
@ClaraJeffery C.W. Dutch Ruppersberger.		Believe his handle is @Call_Me_Dutch.
The five Democrats who voted with Republicans to block a vote on Yemen:		Jim Costa	Al Lawson	Collin Peterson	Dutch Rupperberger	David Scott
@JM_Ashby We hardly ever see Democrats vote for GOP rules.
Kind of amazing that Democrats bailed Republicans out on this one.		This was a clear winning issue for Democrats.		Does the voting public support Republicans sliding in language to a farm bill rule to subvert the War Powers Act and block any debate on Yemen?		Way to go, Congress.
@byrdinator It was 17 or 18 Republican noes, with 17 Republican absences.
The farm bill rule — which unrelatedly blocks Yemen resolutions from getting a vote — is narrowly adopted 206-203.		I believe five Democrats voted for the rule, saving Republicans from a self-inflicted failure.
We currently have 17 Republicans voting against the rule, but 5 Democrats voting for it.		Democrats handing Republicans a victory because, what, they think the farm bill wouldn’t eventually pass?
And we now have 15 Republicans voting no.		But a number of Democrats haven’t voted, and they gonna gavel quickly to adopt the rule.
One Republican just switched. They still need two.		Coincidentally, if two more of the six Democrats had shown up today, Democrats would have blocked the rule.
At 14 Republican noes. One more Republican could sink it.		(Reminder that they could hold this open and try to flip people too. It’s not like House of Cards.)
Republicans already have lost 13 votes right out of the gate.		If two more Republicans vote no, I think the rule will go down.
Alright. Here we go. Rule vote for the farm bill/to block any Yemen votes. 		By my count, with the vacancies we have today, Republicans can lose 14 and still adopt the rule.		I believe 206 will be the magic number.
This 15-minute vote has now been open for 30 minutes.
@Gkelly1193 That’s about right, yes, but it’s starting to feel longer than normal.
A lot of this rule vote — because I do expect some Republicans to vote — is gonna come down to what combination of lawmakers show up.		Right now, 20 Republicans haven’t voted on a previous procedural vote. But 12 Dems haven’t either.
Good afternoon from the House of Representatives! Lawmakers are about to vote on a rule for the farm bill that’d *also* waive portions of the War Powers Act to block a vote on Yemen.		Real question whether the rule is adopted. GOP vacancies, conservatives, and Dems could sink it.

So we already funded half the govt. Many of the other agencies would stay open during a shutdown anyway. Dems take back the House in January, at which point they pass a CR, dare Senate Rs to vote no, and Trump to veto.		Republicans already lost this fight—they just don’t know it.

More words and thoughts on Pelosi winning the Democratic Caucus vote today:		https://t.co/6FP0bprSL6
DC band name idea: The No Votes.		(jk my band is just me in my apartment strumming chords to Bright Eyes songs...)
A cameraman just nudged me further back from this Kathleen Rice scrum and acted like I was somehow the jerk for being in his way.		What I literally said to him in response: “Buddy.”
Kathleen Rice says this isn’t about getting one specific person to be Speaker, or denying one specific person. She says the anti-Pelosi movement is about “agitating for change.”
Kathleen Rice says members deserve to know when Pelosi plans to leave.		That now seems like the big fight — whether Pelosi will have to announce a date of retirement. If she did, I think a crucial number of the anti-Pelosi Democrats would support her.
The real fight in Congress is not between Republicans and Democrats; it’s between cameramen and print reporters.
Rep. Tim Ryan’s take on the 35 Democrats who didn’t vote for Pelosi today: “Twice as many as you need.”		(A 203-32 vote with 3 blank ballots wasn’t exactly a resounding result for the anti-Pelosi group, but Ryan is technically correct.)
The tally is actually just a little worse for Pelosi than first reported:		It was 203-32, with 3 blank ballots and 1 absence.		(Democrats allow delegates to vote in caucus, though they won’t be allowed to vote on the floor.)
Pelosi wins the Caucus vote to be Speaker, 203-32.		She’s short of the 218 she needs on the floor in January, but this number really isn’t awful for her. 		We know of about 22 hard noes right now. The other 10 are probably just posturing. https://t.co/mQB8q9hThw
Kathleen Rice, one of the three anti-Pelosi members to meet with her today, says their concerns were “dismissed outright.”		Pelosi isn’t looking to make any deals. https://t.co/W9iUrHZD4y
I asked Hakeem Jeffries why ageism didn’t have anything to do with him winning, considering he continues to make a case for “generational change.”		In a non-answer answer, Jeffries said everyone made their own assessment as to why they voted the way they did.
Hakeem Jeffries is asked about Barbara Lee saying ageism and sexism had something to do with her losing the Dem Caucus Chair race.		Jeffries says the race was a “friendly competition of ideas.”
Question: Do you think ageism or sexism played a part in this race?		Barbara Lee: “Well, I think you heard and saw what took place. So I absolutely think that’s the case.”
Barbara Lee asked if ageism or sexism had to do with her losing her race to be Caucus Chair. 		She says she “absolutely” thinks that was part of the reason.
Pretty close race between Hakeem Jeffries and Barbara Lee for Dem Caucus Chair.		Jeffries won, in part, by arguing for a younger Democratic leadership.		(Jeffries is also a guy to watch to one day — sooner or later — be Speaker.)		https://t.co/z59L02VLjh

@seanspicer I mean, I’m all for these quirky voting tactics — nothing gets me going like when Democrats vote present on the RSC budget — but I think you’d be hard-pressed to find a single Republican willing to do this.
@billscher True, though I don’t expect Mia Love will vote for Pelosi either.
Well, I’m entering my ‘Basically Crying At Heartwarming, Branded Content’ stage of life with very few regrets.		https://t.co/Us27bxI2aN
(Seth Moulton and Cedric Richmond are still sitting on the floor talking. The House adjourned about 45 minutes ago.)
I will note that Marcia Fudge is one of two Democratic members who refuses to cosponsor the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to sexual orientation and gender identity.		(The other is Dan Lipinski.) https://t.co/rte68HKS35
Tim Ryan, Ed Perlmutter, Seth Moulton are still on the floor.		There's also a group of CBC members: Jim Clyburn, Cedric Richmond, and Bennie Thompson.		Richmond just walked over to Moulton and now they're sitting together talking.
Wait, Seth Moulton has joined Ryan and Perlmutter on the floor.		I will say, if I've learned anything from the Freedom Caucus, don't judge a legislative obstructionist by his suits.
One thing that continues to bother me, as I watch Tim Ryan and Ed Perlmutter hang out on the floor:		Are these guys really the ones who are capable of dethroning Nancy Pelosi.		Tim Ryan is wearing a TAN SUIT today for Christ's sake!
Another thing: Tim Ryan and Seth Moulton are proposing other women for the job of speaker.		(They recognize that it's not such a great look that some white guys are trying to prevent a woman from the speaker's job.)		(They keep pushing Marcia Fudge.)		https://t.co/1BYzOqxKAG
One more thing: I had the office of a prominent Democrat reach out to me this afternoon to tell me they think their member is well-positioned to become Speaker if Pelosi is blocked.		In short, there's some interest in the position.		https://t.co/1BYzOqxKAG
Reminder that this is far from over, but the anti-Pelosi Democrats are moving fast to try and force Pelosi's hand.		They don't want her picking off Democrats one by one, which is what she very well could do, but they're counting on boxing themselves in.		https://t.co/1BYzOqxKAG
Here are the 17 Democrats currently signed on to the letter to oppose Pelosi.		There are a bunch more Democrats who say they won't support her, but have not signed the letter — at least not yet. (Conor Lamb, Abigail Spanberger, Jason Crow, Andy Kim, etc.)		https://t.co/1BYzOqxKAG https://t.co/AHG9oOFHuE
Here we go: There are 17 names currently on the letter to oppose Pelosi.		I count another half-dozen-ish who have kind of firmly said they won't support Pelosi on the floor. The numbers do not look good.		https://t.co/1BYzOqxKAG
So I have the list of Democrats who are currently signed on to the letter to oppose Pelosi.
@mls1776 A Dem member brought up Boehner to me today, noting that Walter Jones outlasted him.
I'm saving a good anecdote about the speaker race for my story and will not tweet it until the piece goes live.		I just want my bosses to know that I'm asking myself the important question: https://t.co/jZMHGbIS8i
@7im I maybe don’t take that idea seriously enough, but I’m sticking with zero. 		Present votes would be a half vote, maybe she could get some of those? But it makes her position as speaker pretty untenable, I think.
Another member has been added.
People would trust reporters less I think if they knew how often we forget which day of the week it is.

Hey haven't been following the House GOP leadership elections who won?
New focus from anti-Pelosi members like Tim Ryan is pointing out the women in their group, like Marcia Fudge and Kathleen Rice.		Ryan and others pushing narrative that a woman should be Speaker, just not Pelosi.
Tim Ryan also says there will be a “handful” of members who will not be on their letter who are committed to not voting for Pelosi.
Tim Ryan says the number of Pelosi opponents is in the “mid-20s.”
Seems like a good way to ensure the Speaker race happens every day for two years. https://t.co/gCXnDvn74d
Exiting the Dem Caucus meeting together: Conor Lamb and Abigail Spanberger.		Both publicly say they won’t support Pelosi. Lamb just told me he would not vote present on the floor either.
@dwallbank The effort is in shambles.
Multiple Democratic members who publicly support Pelosi are speculating to me on background that she doesn’t have the numbers and can’t get there.
One thing about covering Democrats: It’s very difficult to interview Gerry Connolly in one, uninterrupted session. There’s a lot of schmoozing he has to do with the people who are passing by.
This is exactly right, but it has to be much closer to 20 intractable members than 10.		As long as 20 members are firm that they won’t support Pelosi on the floor — or even vote present — they’ll force a race.		Lesson of the Freedom Caucus. https://t.co/5AdeF6SKp6
@svdate Floor, Shirish. No one cares about the Caucus vote.
Just got word of another incumbent on no one's radar who's apparently signing the letter against Pelosi.		Again, my number is increasing against Pelosi, not going the other way.

@krossny1 I'm fairly confident neither of them will run for speaker.

Handing My Phone To Members So They Can Review My Whip List: The Matt Fuller Story
Tim Ryan says we can “safely assume” the 10 remaining names on a letter pushing for rules changes will be on the letter vowing not to vote for Pelosi to be Speaker. 		You can find those names here: https://t.co/MVeGoLPkWQ
It seems like the delay for releasing the letter from anti-Pelosi Democrats is them checking in with the incoming freshman and making sure they’re solid.		So my guess is, as soon as people like Tim Ryan and Seth Moulton check in with those freshmen, they’ll release the letter.
Rep. Tim Ryan says the letter of opponents to Pelosi *will* include names of incoming freshman. 		I think this means the 20-ish names is around 20-ish names in total.
Hakeem Jeffries says he’s ruling himself out for Speaker. “I’m running for one thing,” he says.		(Promises like this are the emptiest promises.)

Yes, the White House making up some crap about a reporter accosting an aide when we can all see on tape what actually happened, and then revoking that reporter’s pass, is insane.		But this feels like one of the rare instances where “IT’S A DISTRACTION” is an apt description.

Pretty clear that Democrats in 2020 will face a lot of the same problems as 2016: They’re winning districts that Clinton won, but they’re not gaining in areas where Trump won, like Ohio and Florida.		And that’s after Republicans voted to gut health care. https://t.co/6InvV9UOXo

The House map still looks pretty large to me for Democrats. A lot of potential pickups still out there.		The big numbers are still in play, I think, but settling into the 230-245 area imo.
Again, the House polling is looking pretty accurate to me, and a general rule of thumb of mine is sticking: If a Republican was at 47% in the most recent Upshot poll — even if the Dem was at 46% — they're probably going down.		See: Brat, David.
Down goes Rep. Pete Roskam (R-Ill.).		No real surprise there, but a very shrewd GOP member — once the chief deputy whip with an eye toward one day being speaker — who got behind the GOP health care bill and helped write the tax bill.
Looking like Abigail Spanberger is gonna defeat Dave Brat. 		Nearly 99% reporting and Spanberger is up almost 2,000 votes. I expect someone to call it any minute now.
Imagine you're surfing at the beach and you see a decent looking wave from afar, but then it starts dissipating and it's not looking very large at all, but then maybe it's starting to look decently sized after all, just not huge — welcome to Election Night 2018.
First "Lean Republican" on the Cook Political Report to go for Democrats. https://t.co/ulsySm5zcr
@LbudisaLila They're crazy. Way too early.
@ArthurDelaneyHP Quite possibly. We’ll have to see what the turnout looks like.
Now that you people are coming back more toward my House projections, I'll take this opportunity to remind you that there is still a *ton* in flux. 		The polling is looking pretty accurate, which means so much of this will come down to California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
@vonceyb Really depends on Nevada and Montana. I've leaned Heller recently, and I'm not positive about Tester.
I knew you guys would see it my way. https://t.co/eK5trIAOJp
A Democrat who has said he won't support Pelosi to be Speaker.		One thing looking clearer tonight: If Democrats get the majority, Pelosi is going to have some trouble getting the gavel. https://t.co/KeAJf72e2p
RT @Robillard: Nick Saban is now 1-0 in Senate races, while Taylor Swift is 0-1.
I can still pretty easily see Democrats getting to a 230-ish majority in the House and losing, like, three seats in the Senate, which is an outcome I've been talking about quite a lot.		Still a lot in flux, but I think the House numbers are bit better for Dems than the 538 model.
RT @Robillard: Down goes Donnelly.		The margin here has to be concerning for McCaskill. 		https://t.co/ei0jHE0HdX
Florida tho.		What a world that state is.
If Spanberger and Luria pull it out in Virginia, you could still be looking at some pretty healthy Democratic gains in the House.		But the night for Democrats is gonna mostly depend on Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, and California — which was probably always the case.
The Dave Brat-Abigail Spanberger race is still very tight.		Chesterfield, where she should pick up a few thousand votes, still hasn't completely reported.
Folks, there's still a long way to go before we really know anything. Let's talk after we see where Pennsylvania and New Jersey are at.		But yeah: The big numbers that Democrats were hoping for aren't looking so likely.
Well, folks, this is about the time of night where I think I’ll note that I can see Republicans holding on to the House, maybe Democrats pick up a few seat majority.
Yet another fool's errand for the NRCC: They spent $1.5 million trying to hold an open Republican district that Clinton won by 19 points.		Democrat Donna Shalala just won it.		In the end, Shalala's perceived weakness was a benefit for Democrats. It gave the NRCC false hope.
@ToddWaggoners Same.
Wow this was a good tweet.		Some guy really nailed this race a couple weeks back. https://t.co/IqPnASR1L3
The NRCC communications director was *literally* on Fox News today talking up Comstock’s chances of holding her seat, so that was a good call.
Looking like Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.) is on track to lose by double digits, which is...exactly what we expected all along, despite the NRCC inexplicably spending $5 million there.		Gotta be one of the NRCC’s most questionable decisions of the cycle.

I’ll just say — as I stand in line at a polling place that astoundingly has only one machine to receive ballots — that long voting lines are maddening.		It’s a political choice that politicians inflict upon us for political reasons.		It shouldn’t and doesn’t have to be this way.

@peterjhasson Yeah, what you seemed most interested in was mutually working out how we correctly categorize support for Steve King among elected Republicans. Aw shucks. I guess that snowflake just couldn’t handle a dialogu, huh?
@peterjhasson Not policing, just think it illustrates my point. People who don’t support Steve King — presumably like you, like Jerry — still go out and support the Republicans who do, like Ted Cruz.		And you weren’t asking a question. Your follow up tweet wasn’t about starting some dialogue.
@NerdNeuro That is actually how I’ll die.
I think my favorite part about this guy trying to own me is that one of the people who gleefully retweeted him — @JerryDunleavy — used to work for Ted Cruz.		Ted Cruz personally called Steve King and offered him his support. https://t.co/FYFX3klVWb
@mirandayaver What if doing “you know what” at Dairy Queen is actually “supporting white nationalists.”
@peterjhasson Um, sure. It’ll also be “interesting” to see what people say *after* the election.		But it’s pretty hard to argue that Republicans haven’t had a chance to say or do anything about Steve King. This has been years in the making and they have stood by him.		See also: Donald Trump.
He died doing what he loved: Getting into a Twitter argument after midnight with some dude who’s willfully misrepresenting the support Steve King has among elected Republicans because he doesn’t want to associate his party with white nationalism.		(This is very specific, I know.)
@peterjhasson Not at all. Paul Ryan is very consciously choosing not to say anything.		Although I will note he’s been “explicitly” asked about King in the past and he refused to say anything critical, so I’m happy to say he explicitly supports Steve King if you’d like.
@peterjhasson “Some” in the first case means two elected Republicans.		Your demand that we carefully note the *two* instances of Republicans distancing themselves from King obscures that *hundreds* of other congressional Republicans have stood by him — financially, explicitly, or tacitly.
@peterjhasson On the one hand, you Steve Stivers and [checks notes] Carlos Curbelo. On the other, you have President Donald Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen.Ted Cruz, Sen. Chuck Grassl
@peterjhasson Not really. Name another Republican who’s disowned him. Carlos Curbelo?		And if you wanna go shot for shot, I’ll be happy to point out how many Republicans have financially contributed to King and how many are explicitly standing by him, like the President and House GOP leaders.

I'm glad this piece holds up Andrew Gillum's "I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist; I’m simply saying the racists believe he’s a racist" line as the new paradigm of messaging, because that uniquely cut through so much bullshit I can hardly believe a Dem politician said it!

The unhinged rantings of a President aside, the rocket ship to blimp thing feels a little like a Kanye lyric. https://t.co/aAaN3FY581
I'll end this thread here.		My final point is that, contrary to claims that no one would have been affected by the pre-existing conditions waivers, the CBO projected that about half of America's population lives in states that would have eventually implemented those waivers.
The bill also would have defunded Planned Parenthood.		(It very cleverly did this by preventing federal funds from going to an organization that met very specific criteria. The CBO report actually said it only expected Planned Parenthood to be affected.)
Essentially, there was a more rigid formula for the tax credits in the AHCA. The tax credits were more determined on age and income rather than how much insurance costs in your state.		So for some people, that could have also dramatically raised prices.
The AHCA also would have decreased the tax credits to pay for insurance for some people.		For some states — like Alaska — that would have been a huge deal, because the bill also would have made the tax credits less dependent on differing prices in states.
The AHCA would have also allowed insurers to charge older people a lot more than they charge younger people.		Under current law, insurers can charge older people three times as much as the young. Under the AHCA, insurers could have charged older people five times as much.
The AHCA would have also allowed states to convert Medicaid to a block grant program. That would have inevitably raised prices on Medicaid recipients.		And states would have also likely had to tighten eligibility requirements and reduced benefits to make the cuts work.
Another huge item we don't talk about enough is the Medicaid cuts.		The AHCA would have cut over $800 billion in funding for Medicaid, resulting in 14 million fewer people with insurance.		Think about that: The GOP health care bill contained an $800 billion cut to Medicaid.
The EHB provisions are particularly interesting because it could have dramatically changed insurance for people on employer-sponsored plans.		Essentially, if your state got a waiver to redefine EHBs, insurers could have decided things like hospitalization wouldn't be covered.
One item we now don't hear about enough is how the AHCA would have changed Essential Health Benefits.		EHBs are a list of 10 services insurers must cover, like emergency services, prescription drugs and maternity care.		AHCA would have allowed states to redefine EHBs w/ a waiver.
First of all, yes, the GOP health care bill would have undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions.		Despite what some Republicans are saying now, a key part of the bill was allowing states to waive certain protections if they set up high-risk pools.
As much as Democrats are running on health care, I still feel like a few aspects of the GOP health care bill have been lost to time. 		We all know it risked raising prices on people with pre-existing conditions, but it did a lot more than that.		A short thread:

One somewhat overlooked item tonight: Donald Trump.		Abigail Spanberger didn't mention Trump once. 		For a midterm election that most people consider a referendum on Trump, it's pretty interesting that Democrats never mention the guy!		https://t.co/UIElZNg7zh
Dave Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi 21 times during his debate tonight with his Democratic opponent Abigail Spanberger.		The audience was laughing and groaning it got so noticeable.		Here's what mentioning Nancy Pelosi 21 times looks like: https://t.co/UIElZNg7zh https://t.co/9stq6Sg8dg
Blackjack!		A bonus time mention of Pelosi!		Dave Brat literally mentioned Nancy Pelosi 21 times during an hour and a half debate.
18 times now.		We're in the closing remarks, so this might be it, but yeah, mentioning Nancy Pelosi 18 times in a debate — far more than the times he's mentioned Abigail Spanberger's name.		Oh, wait, 19 times!		Check that: 20 times.		That'll be his last mention, folks.
16 times.		The groans have become laughs.		And now it's 17 times.
15 times now.		I'm not sure Dave Brat has realized the crowd thinks it's weird that he's mentioned Nancy Pelosi so much — they're actually groaning — but either way, he's pressing ahead.
13 times now.		On this latest mention, people guffawed, so Brat — per the rules on interruptions — asked for an additional 10 seconds.		Oh, and it's 14 times now.
12 times.		It's feeling a bit...forced.
@brfreed There are multiple measures of PPM.		PPM with minutes that Brat has spent talking, and overall PPM. 		Overall PPM easier, but a less reliable statistic.
Ten times.		I hadn't even finished my last tweet before he mentioned it again.		And he did it again.		Now we're at 11 on times Dave Brat has mentioned Nancy Pelosi in this debate.
Nine times.		I'm not sure he's realized that the crowd is actually groaning every time he does this.		The moderator just asked the crowd to not do that, and instead make their voices heard at the polls.
Dave Brat claims the Washington Post gave Abigail Spanberger four pinocchios on her claims about health care.		That claim itself is untrue. The WaPo fact checker has asked that Brat's campaign take down their false press release. They still haven't.
Eight times now.		The groans are getting louder.
@baseballcrank Is your point that you think Obamacare was bipartisan, or is this just some partisan whataboutism to illustrate that some Democrats once also falsely claimed a bill was bipartisan?		I'm honestly confused.
Seven times now.		Dave Brat got more laughs and groans on the sixth mention, so he asked for more time and picked it back up at Nancy Pelosi for that seventh mention.
If you have a bill that does 40 different things and three of those things were once supported by *some* Democrats, but the bill itself was never supported by *any* Democrat, yeah, I'm not sure you get to call that bipartisan.
Dave Brat claims the Goodlatte bill was bipartisan because...elements of it...were once...supported by Democrats...		No Democrat in the House supported the Goodlatte bill...or helped write it...sooo not quite bipartisan by any traditional standard — or really any standard at all.
Dave Brat has now mentioned Nancy Pelosi five times.
Times when you can use the phrase "I look forward to answering your questions":		-Opening statement of congressional testimony.	-Opening statement of a House race debate.	-When you're being deposed by your spouse's lawyer because your spouse thinks you're cheating but you're not.
Two mentions of Nancy Pelosi within the first 45 seconds of Dave Brat's opening statement.		Man, someone should do a podcast on this.

Did Brett Kavanaugh know it was over when he asked Amy Klobuchar if she had ever blacked out?		When exactly did Bork know it was over?
Again, Kavanaugh claims he didn't know Ford.		She somehow:		-Began telling people about this assault years ago	-Came up with a story involving Kavanaugh and his friends (who she supposedly didn't know)	-Contacted her Congresswoman before he was nominated		That's some conspiracy!
Can we get clarification on what "skis" means?
OH conversation between two members, as they pass: “...the WASPs at Phillips Exeter...”
To believe Brett Kavanaugh, you also have to believe he's never blacked out, which he just testified under oath has never happened.
Another thing Kavanaugh just said: He raised the point that he couldn't have been drinking on a day when he was working out at Tobin's house.		And yet, July 1, he works out at Tobin's house and *also* has "skis" at Timmy's house later.
And by the way, not sure what “Skis" means — maybe “brewskis”? — but if he was drinking that night, weird, because that wasn’t a weekend night. https://t.co/PL9Q4EKFMp
I missed this before, but I was just looking at Kavanaugh’s calendar, and I noticed that he’s hanging out on July 1, among a few other people, with “PJ” and “Judge.”		Pretty amazing coincidence that Ford, before she saw the calendars, said PJ and Mark Judge were there. https://t.co/8lXwiROHiO
The idea that Kavanaugh couldn't have been at a small party during the week is undercut by his own testimony and calendars.		He says he did hang out occasionally and have beers with friends during the week, but where's that on the calendar?		A 6-person party isnt exactly a rager.
