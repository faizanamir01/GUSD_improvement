Rememba dis? 100% JARED. You can bank on it. 		How Saudi elite became five-star prisoners at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton 		https://t.co/XRTJUjd77I
“Lunch at the White House with the president for a middle-rank deputy crown prince was just not supposed to be done.”		But there's The Orange Shitgibbon, doin' it. Of course. 🤡
"Woodward notes that MBS had lunch with Trump in the White House’s State Dining Room, which is usually reserved for meetings between the president and other foreign leaders. “This VIOLATED PROTOCOL, unsettling officials at the State Department and the CIA,”
"When it looked like they were close, Kushner invited MBS to the United States and brought him to the White House,” Woodward writes. The visit took place in 3/17, two months before Trump’s trip to the Middle East."
"Woodward adds that “NO ONE supported the idea of a summit” in the spring of 2017, as Kushner was offering. Yet Kushner eventually got his way. With the president’s support, and despite the other senior officials’ objections, Kushner pushed for a visit to Saudi Arabia." 		😠
Lawyers distancing themselves from their clients...not a good look:		https://t.co/SHBfGrLFAX
Of Course Jared Kushner Got His Top-Secret Security Clearance Through Nepotism https://t.co/XBrHxZMaTa
"Woodward writes that Tillerson also believed “engagement with MBS should be taken with a grain of salt. The U.S. could work hard on a summit, and in the end have NOTHING.”		And that's what we have right now. N-O-T-H-I-N-G. Except for more money for Jared. And SCANDALS...
"Tillerson, who had worked with the Saudi leadership during his years as CEO of ExxonMobil, CAUTIONED against Kushner’s wish of negotiating a number of large deals with MBS."		But hey, the 37-yr-old silver-spooner knows best, amirite?
"Then-Secty of State Rex Tillerson and then-National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster (who was officially Harvey’s direct boss), both of whom, like Mattis, had extensive experience working in the Middle East."		When even RExxon Tillerson won't go as far as you are willing to go 🙄
"Woodward writes that Defense Secretary JAMES MATTIS WAS SKEPTICAL about Kushner’s suggestions, as were two other top administration officials: ..."
"Kushner &amp; Harvey allegedly pushed for a major summit to be held in Saudi Arabia during Trump’s visit, as a way of bringing the American-Saudi relationship back to the center of U.S. foreign policy, and that MBS became their main pt of contact for org'g the president’s arrival."
Showing favoritism to the younger MBS WOULD CAUSE FRICTION in the royal family,” he added." 🙄
RT @DianeNolan1: @MsMariaT @realDonaldTrump We hate him.
"The message from them was that Kushner better be careful,” Woodward wrote. “The real solid guy was the current crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, who was known as MBN. He was the king’s nephew credited with dismantling Al-Qaida in the Kingdom as head of the Interior Ministry"
"Kushner told Harvey he had important and reliable intelligence that the key to Saudi Arabia was the deputy crown prince, the charismatic 31-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS,” writes Woodward. Some INTEL CHIEFS IN D.C. DISAGREED."		😡🤬
"Woodward claims that while sr U.S. intelligence officials believed that the most influential Saudi was the then-crown prince, former intelligence chief Mohammed bin Nayef, Kushner had a different reading of the situation." 		I'll bet Jared did. 🧐
"After writing that Kushner had strong ties to the most senior levels of the Israeli gov't, including PM Benjamin Netanyahu, Woodward then describes a disagreement between Kushner and other sr U.S. officials over who was the most important figure to work w/in Saudi Arabia."
"The Saudis and Israelis, both longtime foes of Iran, had both open and important back-channel relations.”		JARED AND TRUMP.		https://t.co/V2w0RBo0dB

Oh, and some money from Israeli investors too. Bonus! (first tweet):		https://t.co/lztomC2Wso
" Harvey told Kushner that choosing Riyadh as the first foreign capital to be visited by President Donald Trump would “fit perfectly with what we’re trying to do, reaffirm our support for the Saudis, our strategic objs in the region.”		And get some money from SA in the deal.
"Woodward writes that Kushner discussed the issue with Derek Harvey, a retired military colonel who was in charge of Middle East policy at the National Security Council during Trump’s first year as president."
"The idea was to send a message about the U.S.’ commitment to forging closer relations between the two countries, who are both regional enemies of Iran."
"Woodward says it was the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser who first proposed that the president’s first official foreign trip should include two stops: SAUDI ARABIA and Israel."
"According to Woodward’s account in the just-published “Fear,” Kushner’s efforts began during the first months of the Trump administration in early 2017...."

"The report also said that Zuberi belatedly registered as a consultant to the government of Sri Lanka, as required by law under the Foreign Agents Registration Act."
"Zuberi’s habit of trading on his political connects veered into his role as an agent for a foreign gov't....the Times said that in 2015, “the scandal-plagued gov't of Sri Lanka paid a total of $6.5M to Zuberi...to have included seeking to influence the American gov't.”
"Mr. Zuberi’s co, Ave Ventures, acts as a consultant and has offices in China and the UAE, w/investments in India and Bahrain. The donation apparently generated coveted invitations to black-tie dinners and photo ops w/the US pres and some of his high-ranking officials..."
RT @RacoonSquadron: Oh. https://t.co/gNyE1vKB0K
"This came in the wake of US then introducing a resolution at the UN Human Rights Council to probe alleged war crimes. It has transpired that Mr. Zuberi played the role of a middleman and benefited from large amount of moneys paid to these so-called PR firms."
"Pakistan-born Mr Zuberi has figured in Police investigations into how then Monitoring MP for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sajin de Vass Gunawardena, allegedly hired public relations firms in the US to promote Sri Lanka."		https://t.co/eZzDtMimVg
The fact this guy is based out of L.A., tells me that either Broidy or Barrack set him in front of Cohen and Trump.		Possibly even Dana Rohrabacher, since Zuberi donated to him as well.
"The Daily Beast also reported that Zuberi was in contact with Elliott Broidy, former Republican National Committee finance chairman, about potential business."		Of course he was.
"Sri Lanka paid [Imaad Zuberi] $4.5M directly and $2 million to a company he co-owned for consulting work that included influencing the U.S. government. And he didn’t properly disclose to the United States the extent of his arrangement with Sri Lanka, the report said."
"Zuberi is also vice president of strategic dev for Manhattan Street Capital, a San Diego start-up that provides a platform through which cos can raise funding. Manhattan Street Capital did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"...an auto sales firm named Avenue Automotive Group and a handful of real estate investment firms."		Guys, there's no huge investment firms in South El Monte. Trust me. 😁
"Zuberi is also CEO of So El Monte companies named Avenue Capital Group Inc. and Avenue Investment Services Inc., described on state docs as investment firms. Listed at the same So El Monte address are several other cos where he also serves as CEO..."
"Zuberi’s LinkedIn IDs him as vice chairman of priv equity and VC firm Avenue Ventures. He has “closed over $15B...” at the firm, whose clients include start-ups, major corps and sovereign wealth funds...		Avenue Ventures does not appear to have a working website..." 🚩
"In 2017, NYT reported that after the $900K donation from Ave Ventures to Trump’s inaugural committee, Zuberi was granted attendance to the Chairman’s Global Dinner, “a pre-inauguration, black-tie gathering intended to introduce the incoming pres to the foreign diplomatic corps.”
"[Imaad] Zuberi has also donated to the campaigns of Republican candidates — including Sens. Lindsey Graham of SC and Rand Paul of KY and then-Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of Costa Mesa, CA  — as well as the RNC and NRCC."		https://t.co/dLd3enoBBx

@PortlusGlam @MacFinn44 @arapaho415 @Agenthades1 "In 2006 and 2007, while working as a physician's assistant in Alliance, Heben forged a doctor's signature on prescriptions for anabolic steroids some 16 times, eventually pleading no contest to three felony forgery charges and having his physician's assistant license suspended."
@PortlusGlam @MacFinn44 @arapaho415 @Agenthades1 "In 1994, he was arrested by Cleveland police and later pled guilty to two first-degree misdemeanors of attempted deception to obtain dangerous drugs...and attempted illegal processing of drug documents of the prescription variety."		Stolen scrips?
@PortlusGlam @MacFinn44 @arapaho415 @Agenthades1 "Despite what Heben's camp viewed as rudeness directed toward a wounded ex-Navy SEAL, the answer to detectives' original question was YES, Heben had been convicted of a crime, time and time again..."

The second American that Martinelli spied on, was Colonel Richard Downie, retired. (Again, Martinelli: idiot!). Downie was also there in Panama, in 2014, working on another campaign.
Trump had the current pres of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, at the WH in 6/17. Christian Ferry had worked on Varela’s campaign in Panama, in 2014. Think Trump asked Varela to make this go away? 🤔 It’s his MO.
H/t to @DemocracyJourno ✌️
Martinelli, used the Pegasus software he purchased from Israel, to surveil opponents. He published cringeworthy results of the spying in news pubs that he controlled (idiot). His trial finally begins in Panama next month, and his NSC underlings have already fingered him.
Christian Ferry (Lindsey Graham’s 2016 campaign mgr, who was also listed as a key indiv in Deripaska’s lawsuit against Gates &amp; Manafort 🚩) was one of two Americans found to be spied on by Ricardo Martinelli- ex pres of Panama, awaiting trial for espionage, close assoc of Trump. https://t.co/pIfVDubYzS
