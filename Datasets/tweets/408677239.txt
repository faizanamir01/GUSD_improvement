Are you kidding?
“For evil to flourish, it only requires good men to do nothing.” — Simon Wiesenthal, Death camp survivor and Nazi hunter
that we are not forgetting them, that when their voices are stifled we shall lend them ours, that while their freedom depends on ours, the quality of our freedom depends on theirs. - Elie Wiesel 2/2
As long as one dissident is in prison, our freedom will not be true. As long as one child is hungry, our life will be filled with anguish and shame. What all these victims need above all is to know that they are not alone; 1/2
Human rights are being violated on every continent. More people are oppressed than free. How can one not be sensitive to their plight? Human suffering anywhere concerns men and women everywhere. - Elie Wiesel
When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. -Elie Wiesel
Where have we seen humans dehumanized  as animals in world history? Never Forget.

RT @eclasper: LIBRARY WORKERS: What was the best professional development experience you had in the past 2 years?	Respond and RT
@eclasper @wawoodworth The NYSCATE conference in NY State. It is an excellent conference for all librarians- you learn new apps, programs, ideas and network w many educators.
And how many government letters and @Ford letters am I going to receive telling me its my responsibility but nobody has the parts or the time to order them individually?!!? Plus the airbag could still explode and kill someone!
None of the @Ford dealers are going to follow this silly process that makes no sense at all- order parts per individual with 3,000-4,000 customers per dealership affected. Release the parts and make our cars safe again!
I will never buy a @Ford again after this airbag recall nonsense. Fire your vendor who is doing the customer service. Open a factory that makes the parts ASAP. Seems pretty simple to me. NONSENSE!

80s day is the BEST Spirit Day of the year!!!! Last year I channeled Barb from "Stranger Things", but this year I am taking it back to when I was 11 and I had Madonna and MJ on vinyl.
It is 80s day tomorrow, and you bet I'm going back to those days when I dressed up as Madonna, stacked my bracelets, put a big bow in my hair and got down to "Like A Virgin" on my record player.

#amreading An Unkindness of Magicians by Kat Howard. Great read for mature YA, specifically fantasy lovers who prefer the idea of another magical universe in a contemporary setting (NYC). Nonstop action, intrigue, revenge, suspense. Loved this.

@MolleeBranden Ready for the sequels of Caraval and The Bear and the Nightingale. #YearofYA
A2: We need to be confident in the real world, and I feel it is important for all of us to be role models. YA and literature mirrors our world in creating strong females who ate also role models and heroines for us to look up to.  #YearofYA
@MolleeBranden A1: I read Caraval by Stephanie Garber also! Sorry I forgot in first tweet. #YearofYA
@tavia_clark A1: The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden(Winternight Trilogy) #YearofYA

The kind of movie that makes you think about how you can  help other people and make the world a better place.  @LionMovie
That's the kind of movie that makes you think your heroes really could be doing a better job saving the world instead of wasting their time and money on trivial pursuits. @LionMovie

@beckyksu @ncte @ProjectLITComm Sometimes I think kids seek out the high interest titles they want and I want to bring these to them.
@beckyksu @ncte @ProjectLITComm And I am not sure what level you are but a couple of my students read The Heroin Diaries outside of school but when I asked if I should have in library, they look at me uneasily but they read it at home. Thoughts?

@nova_road You are so lucky.
@nova_road So, did you film this from the road to the beach? They had it open? Probably will close for that launch though, right? Incredible. Wish I could be there for the launch.
@elonmusk Wish I could see it in person. Great job, @SpaceX . (and what a show!)
