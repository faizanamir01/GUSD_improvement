@DJM1949 I guess anything to do with your heart is serious but a 50% blockage didn’t rise to the need for a stent, so I guess that’s good. It’s still scary and I’m unfamiliar with these meds &amp; how much time it will buy me, but I do know that prayer changes things so I appreciate prayers❤️
@Donnalady Well, it wasn’t a heart attack, PTL, &amp; I admit I am addicted to my phone &amp; Twitter LOL. A tweet for prayer was my first instinct…Apparently it’s a 50% blockage and meds are supposed to help keep me alive. How long is in the Lords hands…Thank you ❤️🌸

@colemarisa49 @haynes_nan @doctorneilsmith @realDonaldTrump Life begins at conception, the baby has all the DNA from his parents and is therefore a living human being deserving life.
