@RealJamesWoods I get what she's driving at with the correlation between the fully automatic [military] M16 and the semi-automatic [civilian] AR15 equivalent. She's wrong though! Citizens use these firearms all the time to defend themselves and their families &amp; property.
@BriannaWu My teenage son is very proficient in the use of the civilian equivalent AR15, and he often enjoys target practice at the range under my supervision.
@BriannaWu You're wrong. US citizens use them to defend their homes &amp; families, and several have even used them recently to thwart deadly home invasions.

@MetLife Thank you. I’m definitely shopping. #USAA blew it!
RT @YouReviewTool: 67% of online consumers who are more likely to purchase from a business with a positive online reputation. What are you…
@pennst8drr @USAA I’m actually conducting reconnaissance and gathering intel right now. 👍 One thing is clear, they employ a lot of internal #PR &amp; Comms folks. They’re gonna need’em.
*Finally got a call-back ...right after this tweet and still no resolution of the matter. I’ll just pay the fee and switch to another insurer, but @USAA has set me on a mission, and they’re not going to like it.
@Bek13Nelson I love my @Ford F-150 ...just wish I hadn’t insured it via @USAA
@usaaef This “educational foundation” sounds like a shil for your #USAA insurance &amp; banking products.
@USAA @stephm75 #USAA May be great to work for, but their customer service is the pits.
@Laura_Propp Q: Are you paid to just tweet pro-USAA info...? #USAA
@elainebeare @AmerBanker @USAA needs all the help they can get...
@johnnywehrung @USAA_help They won’t even get your joke. They’re that bad.
@USAAssociation @johnnywehrung @USAA_help @USAA Serving was the honor of a lifetime, and it’s more than just a paycheck or an advertising slogan to me, unlike the #USAA insurance co.
@USAAssociation @johnnywehrung @USAA_help And, I’m confident your grassroots group does a much better job of defending the Constitution than @USAA does insuring vets like me. 🇺🇸
@USAAssociation @johnnywehrung @USAA_help Yes. I saw @johnnywehrung accidentally included your organization [that he follows]. That’s all. Thank you. He meant @USAA instead.
@johnnywehrung @USAA_help @USAAssociation They don’t even get what your saying and think it’s your account their referencing... * SIGHT * Face Palm!
It's 4:20 P.M. and still no call-back from Megan in your #USAA #Tampa office.
I never went ahead and moved my auto from #USAA to another insurer... 	Boy, was that a mistake.
And, still not a peep from #USAA.

Lawsuits are seldom the way to go, but maybe I need to explore that with #USAA. I’ve never filed a single suit against any individual or corporation, but I’m at the end of my rope with @USAA and no @USAA_help to speak of.
@pennycrosman @USAA @USAA_help No. The rep. before Megan even  called back and told me the issue’d been rectified, but that wasn’t true. Got another notice from the DMV nitifying me of an administrative suspension of vehicle Registration and DL! But, they always cash my checks...
@pennycrosman @USAA @USAA_help Yes, Mam. On multiple occasions... You never get the same rep., and they’re not great about calling back.
@pennycrosman Absolutely. I’m awaiting a call-back still on an issue that has not been resolved over several months. @USAA @USAA_help
@USAA @ZAGipson @forrester I’m not sure how they arrived at this conclusion? My experience must be one as an outlier to the typical #USAA experience. #Tampa #Florida
@pennycrosman “Service culture” at #USAA? That’s a doozy.
@stopUSAA Sign me up. I’m ready to enlist in your cause and carry the torch like they’ve never seen before! 🇺🇸 #USAA
@FLHSMV This is unbelievable.
@FLHSMV How’d this happen?
@USAA_help @USAA Drivers will be arrested if pulled over for any infraction while driving on a suspended registration or license - forever branded with a mugshot in the public domain. I need this fixed. #USAA certainly hasn't had a problem cashing my checks vi auto-deduct. #Tampa #Florida
@USAA_help @USAA I called to insure my brand new [silver] Ford F-150 STX in Sept. '17 and replace the coverage on my old '15 [silver] Ford F-150. Well, the transfer never took effect. So, the @FLHSMV suspended my registration. They've now suspended BOTH my license &amp; registration!
@USAA_help Maybe they don't know how hard it is to get someone to actually fix an issue? https://t.co/vlrA33B9ii
@USAA_help @USAA Then, I'm going to reach out to @PamBondi at her office @AGPamBondi to see what recourse their might be via her ofc. Then, I'll work my way down your Board of Directors starting with #USAA CEO, Stuart Parker. You'd better put your best people on this today.
@USAA_help At this point, your reply is laughable, and I've gto ZERO patience. My patience was worn thin. Now, we're in the negative. I spoke with Megan. The representative I spoke with previously lied to me and told me the issue had been rectified.
@USAA_help ...gathering info to file complaints with @JimmyPatronis and his office @FLDFS. Then, I'll work my way over to @AdamPutnam and the State of Florida's Dept. of Ag. and Consumer Services Division via @FDACSNews to inquire about a consumer complaint process there. Lastly, I'll...
