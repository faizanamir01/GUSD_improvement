Mental disorders are sneaky illnesses &amp; relapses could happen to anyone  whether person is taking meds or not.
@Lmo66Olson I agree. That why I said that Court could appoint Psychologist who can do the evaluations. I’m all for protecting &amp; respecting civil rights, but also I’m for drawing the line when it comes to protecting &amp; saving lives of the people.

@GranoSapientia @NedadMemic I tend to follow the facts I’ve witnessed not what the other people tend to tell me what to follow. Big difference.
@Dropingbones @NedadMemic @RodrigoXuarez @Meditatetowin Agreed. Now you know why timeline is important. In 1992 very small numbers of foreign fighters were there. Most of them were students at Universities in Bosnia. 1994 is more crucial to look &amp; examine, especially what took place after Croatian/Bosnian war peace was signed.
@GranoSapientia @NedadMemic Not really. Berle Zecevic did ballistic investigation at a same time so he concluded together with UN that Serb’s indeed shelled Markale. It’s the other side of a political coin why UN rebutted it’s original report.
@GranoSapientia @NedadMemic I did it was part of my job during and after the war. 😉
@Dropingbones @NedadMemic @RodrigoXuarez @Meditatetowin Just info: I lived and worked in Bosnia during entire war, than followed after war recovery and Hague Tribunal for years, so I’m quite familiar with Bosnian war/crimes . I’m pretty fluent in Serbo-Croatian language. Have a degree in Language &amp; Literature from ex YU Univeristy 😉
@Dropingbones @NedadMemic @RodrigoXuarez @Meditatetowin You are partially correct here. Here is first hand info;they came to Bosnia in 1992 &amp; never established good roots anywhere until 1994. They had no more 1500 fighters total during entire war.

@GranoSapientia @NedadMemic Really? Well, I was there when Markale happened, while UN investigated and concluded that shell indeed came from Serbs front line. The report does exist it was presented at Hague. That is one of the many reasons why Mladic and many other Serb’s leaders are camping in prisons now.
@Dropingbones @NedadMemic @RodrigoXuarez @Meditatetowin It does b/c nothing happens over night my dear. Do you really think they established Al-Q movement in 94/95 or even in ‘92? 😉
@Dropingbones @NedadMemic @RodrigoXuarez @Meditatetowin Connect the timeline my dear. From Afghan-Russian war till now. The first WTC attack was in 1993.What took place before that? You can’t talk about AlQ w/out establishing proper timing than connecting that to the Bosnian War. Btwy, the picture you posted was taken in 1994.
