Hi. Women like Susan Collins never have to worry about a lack of reproductive choice access. Her race and her class make her not have to worry about what would happen if she had an unplanned pregnancy. She can always just buy an abortion.
Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) 381 US 479. 		The right to access contraception and the right to privacy. 		This was the foundation for Roe. Could be gone easily.

@cowboycollier And for the final piece of advice in this burst: Remember you are the student AND the scholar. You are learning as you are synthesizing knew knowledge. You are meant be an authority on your subject area by the end of it all. K bye 💖
@cowboycollier Don’t be afraid to ask for help and guidance from your committee. That’s what they’re there for. And don’t fear revision. It may be hard and hurt to change or cut a portion, but it’s ultimately for the better.
@cowboycollier Make a set schedule for when you’ll work and write. It needs to be something you do consistently every week, not just occasionally. And find a fave writing spot. I recommend the Coffee House in Uptown
@cowboycollier A lesson I had the learn the hard way: Don’t bite off more than you can chew. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel to have a meaningful piece of work.
@cowboycollier Start EARLY. You need to have a general idea of what you want to study end of first semester and an adviser end of second.

God created us and so he is delighted. It negates the purpose of creation if he imposed condition on that after creation. 6/6
So I have to believe God delights in us because of what we are, not in what we believe or do. That's unconditional delight in Creation 5/6
...his delight in us is not based on our belief, but on the fact that he created us because he saw we were good then. 4/?
This is true for 2 reasons: 1) If God created us and saw that we are good and 2) he delights in what is good then... 3/?
First, if we are only delightful to God if we believe in him, then the lessons of the creation are inherently false. 2/?

Resisting heterosexual oppression begins with resisting the regulation of our bodies.
If we are criminal, then we can be regulated through systemic means. If we are regulated, then we are controlled and no longer a threat.
Heterosexual oppression of LGBTQIA persons' main purpose is to make the non-hetero body criminal in its very existence.

This all makes me think that being radical in the face of oppression is never a choice but something oppression forces us into.
Is this idealistic? Maybe. But no collective movement of resistance worked by joining in the oppression of other oppressed peoples.
And so if sexism is understood as the oppression of not just women, but also what is perceived as feminine, then GBT men must be a part too
Such a masculinity of course, in the gaze of hegemonic masculinity, is unachievable because we are seen as innately feminine.
This, I believe, must also include gay, bi and trans* men because sexism hurts us too. It creates an acceptable masculinity.
We must also realize that sexism does not just harm women. Sexism cannot be defeated unless it is countered intersectionally.
Sexism will never be defeated unless we deconstruct and rebuild the structures that most reify it. E.g., the modern presidency https://t.co/ujUCtZkiOM

Bears get caught in traps. Russia needs to watch its back if it continues this swaggering.
Example: Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk cannot become the next Sudetenland. Empty promises from eager despots cannot be enough.
While I respect Pres. Obama greatly, we need more than just more diplomacy. Russia needs to be shown that our diplomacy has a spine.
We must make Putin see that his USSR fever dream is just that: A delusion. He is a weak man. We must show him to the mirror.
I believe that Russia will only stop its support of Iran and Assad if it feels alone in the world. We must make them feel lonelier than ever
We must reinforce NATO in the Baltic, support pro-US Central Asian nations and peel away pro-Russia nations left after Cold War (Azer. etc)
We must isolate Russia in the world so Putin &amp; the Kremlin feel the impact of their decisions. Economic sanctions aren't enough.
#Russia interfering with our election is a direct violation of our sovereignty. A swift &amp; strong response is necessary.
