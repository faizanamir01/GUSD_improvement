Do the @CounciofDC members claiming large employers "can afford" higher wages also think #DC residents "can afford" higher prices? #LRAA
.@CouncilofDC Why are unionzed grocery chains, offering barely over #DC min wage w/ tiered benefits, exempt from the #LRAA?
.@CouncilofDC Residents already spend $1B at MD/VA retailers. #DC ranked last in US for being biz friendly. Will #LRAA reverse those trends?
#DC has 2nd highest rate of kids w/ inadequate food access. How does the #LRAA encourage growth &amp; development to those Wards in need?
#DC Residents have the right to know the @CouncilofDC answers to these 5 #LRAA Questions: http://t.co/cfbJitajPs
Exemption of unionized grocers creates the perception some @CouncilofDC members support #LRAA solely at the behest of organized labor.
