I tried to watch last night, but as soon as they let themselves get sucked into the contraception issue, I tuned out.
So the final debate was last night? Good. I've lost interest completely.
Daylight's coming earlier. Time to crash.
In the end, people will still vote based on the economy, and how much gov they are willing to tolerate.
Let the Supreme Court decide this. Until then, it will just be a political football being kicked around by loudmouth pundits and hacks.
I'm not a scholar, so I don't know if it does or not. But it doesn't seem right for th gov to make churches go against their sacred beliefs.
Of course, it's not about contraception bans. It's about whether it violates the constitutional right to religious liberty.
Seasonly adjusted unemployment figures back up to 9%. Whoops! Thought contraception bans was the big story these days.

Newt is trying to emulate Reagan. Whether or not he's succeeding is open for debate. #harharhar
The GOP trying to push their candidate on everyone gives credence to the non-voter argument that the system is rigged and useless.
Tired of this "electability" business. The best one is now out. We're stuck with what we got. Pick one or vote for O again.

May be wishful thinking, but still not convinced that KXL is dead. Wouldn't be surprised to see a "reconsideration" come summer.
From what I'm gathering, he hates oil, rich people, wall street and still blaming Bush. Sounds inspiring.

Whether or not they worked is still open to debate. But the premise that they didn't work is faulty at best.

Maybe it's time for a bulldog as prez. He couldn't do any worse than what we've had the last 3 years.
I can personally attest that being nice often doesn't get you anywhere. This should be esp true in politics. He did what he had to do.
4 years ago, we were wondering if Obama was unelectable over Hillary, due to lack of experience. same deal, with different circumstances.
Newt won SC, as I predicted. Now we have a race. I don't think he's "unelectable" as others do. After all, he was elected many times before.
Getting the mop trimmed. First time since last summer.
Seen a question: Is the GOP racist, or homophobic? Geez, might as well ask how many times a day they beat their spouses...
There was a time not so long ago when being a philandering perv was a resumé paddler when running for prez. 😁
So Newt's a philandering perv. Won't make much difference. Predicting he will win SC. Establishment will be crying and throwing things.
Crowd's all into this debate, too. Newt schooled the media as usual. Looks lonely without Perry.
The timing of the MU shutdown is uncanny. Gov is at odds with the people and must be put back in their proper place: a servant to the people
Repub base just now figuring out they've been played by the media picking off their candidates. Where y'all been? Been going on since July.
Will watch the debate replay later. They just don't seem as important now. Who has the biggest...

Anyway, it's interesting the Skins beat NYG twice and held SF & NE to last minute wins last year. Too bad it meant nothing.
If this happens, O is so gone in November. Landslide. In flames. The economy cannot absorb this high an increase. So screwed, Myrtle.
Oil futures into summer are already zeroing in on $5 gasoline. This will stop what little economic recovery we have. We're screwed, Myrtle.
Watching the #scdebate replay. This crowd is all up in this thing.

Never thought I would see a news anchor with a combover on TV in 2012. Wow. You go, guy. 👍
What's it like being shot at for days on end? That has to mentally take a toll. Stop apologizing for them, government. Write em up n move on

On another note, I just found an album called Chilled House Season 2 with some of the greatest mash ups I've ever heard. Burning CD for car.

The debate was boring because the questions were largely irrelevant.

Worst. Debate. Ever. They never had an opening to go after Obama on anything of substance. We all know why social issues are even brought up
What do they say? When you resort to calling someone Hitler in Chinese, it's over. 😁
Mitt brings up out silent, long-running cyber war with China. This should be an issue in and of itself.
Oh, there's Rick. Thought he left of building... Typical. Pounce when he blunders, ignore when he's on his game.
Increased infrastructure spending? The premise of the question is a trap.
Probably not what he meant, but that's how it sounded. He's correct that we left too fast without securing the peace. May be all for nothing
Perry wants to reinvade Iraq. That's some nads of steel right there, you pacifist pansies... :p 😝
This is such a lame debate. Country's falling apart and they are concerned about contraception bans and gay marriage. #shootmenow
Some days are bad for bad news.
Perry back to Texas to "reassess" campaign. Bachmann still running for the Mars delegates. The establishment got their wish last night.
Romney beats Santorum by 8 votes. Don't ever say your vote doesn't matter.
22% reporting: Romney, Santorum, Paul tied at 23%. Newt 13%, Perry 10%, Bachmann 6%, huntsman 1%. Interesting.
1% precincts reporting. Santorum 1st with 26%. FNC projecting Bachmann will finish last.
I will say that the candidate with the best record has been largely ignored for superficial reasons.
Just realized I said I would endorse a candidate last month and never did. Oh well...
One hour, Iowa. Show us what you got. 🇺🇸
Roughly 24 hours left. Go get 'em, tigers! 😜
Of course, Iowa is just the beginning. Those with the least money are in the worst shape long term.
2 days until Iowa. Looking for an upset; Paul could win, and/or stronger than expected showing by Perry or Bachmann. Stay unpredictable.
Skins finish 5-11. Should be a high draft pick in the spring. Need a franchise QB.
Watched Inception last night. Great flick. Gonna watch I Am Legend later.
Apparently they're rocking so hard they caused an earthquake in Japan. Wow.
Liking NRE this year. They have some entertaining youths on there, they do.
Here's to a Happy New Year. 🎉 📶2⃣0⃣1⃣2⃣🆒
Two days left of '11. Let's see what '12 brings, including election madness. I'm gonna refrain from politics until Iowa on tue Just 'cause.
Picked up 4 $7 Blu Rays earlier, including Inception. Now if I can only motivate myself to fire up the ps3... Music sounds better right now.
Still couldn't help to think of Pimp My Ride. That hearse needs air shocks. And now, a final bounce on outta here...
40 year old vehicles in a state funeral? Folks, that's as good as it gets within a totalitarian state where rice is often hard to find. 🍚
Either way, they are both critical to oil supply to the West. This also makes them obvious targets.
Egypt controls the Suez Canal. Got it mixed up with Straits of Hormuz. Sorry, I'm American and I don't live over there. 😚
My random playlist just went from "Silver Springs" to the dance remix of MM's "Sweet Dreams". That's badass right there. lol
I just realized "All Of the Lights" is not a romantic song at all. 😳
@kelly_clarkson Many will only respect your freedom of expression until you say something they don't like. Such is politics. TY
Speaking of rides, I seen some videos of dear KJ's state funeral in DPRK. Man, they're still using 40 yr old Mercedes & Jeeps over there.
LOL @ Iran closing the Straits of Hormuz. I need gas for my ride, biatches. Nice knowing ya. ⛽🇺🇸

One millionaire says to the other millionaire, "You know, my penor really is bigger than yours."
I still think he can be bribed with an iPad, a 458 Italia and a supermodel. 📱🏁💅
Oh, it's ok for the historical aspect. But his poor people are relieved that a tyrant is gone. But now this kid...
He routinely used food as a weapon against his own people. People found dead in fields with grass stains in their mouths, bc of no food.
Instead, I will have a moment of silence for the two+ million innocents he allowed to starve to death in the cold during his gracious reign.
So I hear KJII funeral is on somewhere, and my first reaction is, "Who would want to watch that shit?" 💀
What a horrible, traumatic evening. But it's getting better now. 😊
I think I can officially say (except for the Rockies and West Coast) that Christmas is finally over for another year. AMEN! 🎄
Day and a half until Christmas. Lots of travelers on the highways today. Be safe out there. 🚗
Daylight is 4 seconds longer today than yesterday in my locale. Longer days will be back... ☀
Everybody, cancel Christmas. It's been discovered that Santa has a large carbon footprint. Have a tofu picnic in a wind farm instead. 🎅🍲
Good lord. Whose bright idea was it to create a "super flu" in a lab in order to "find a cure" for it? That university should b on lockdown.
My, my. Some things you just have to see to believe...
Just heard a long-time friend of the family passed away this morning. Sad news to hear right before Christmas. #ripDewey
Winter begins at 12:30 am EST on Thursday. Central time and points west it begins tomorrow night.
Maybe some more of that crony capitalism is just around the corner. They know just the company to do it, too.
TM is dead anyway. They want to sell out.
AT&T/TM deal is dead. Okay, I want to hear plans from someone else to cover 97% of the country with 4G LTE in 3 years.... Still waiting...
I couldn't be a dictator. There would be so much tech and communication in the country I would get myself overthrown. iPhone factories, too.
His age may make him more open to the outside world. Gadgets, fast cars, and wild women should do the trick.
Over the weekend Kim Jung Il descended to the 7th layer of hell where his father is. His successor presents both opportunities and dilemmas.
The other part of me wants a drag-out fight between Romney, Newt, and Perry until June. 😚
Romney is really racking up endorsements. I don't think he's the best, but part of me is starting to concede that he will be the nominee.
It's been a quiet weekend. These long nights really bother me. Wed is the shortest day of the year, but earliest sunset occurred 1 week ago.
They all nailed it on Keystone and energy policy in general. It's far too important to this country to be a political football.
After 60 degrees the last two days, back to snow showers tomorrow. Ugh.
I will say that RP confirmed his place in the GOP as the crazy uncle who lives in the attic. Totally floored by his response on Iran. 😳
I missed the first half of the debate so I'll have to catch the replay. In the meantime, reading some strongly opinionated tweets about it.
The ol' fuzz buster conked out on me. Hate driving around not getting a heads up on speed traps. 🚓🚥
Government wants a national ban on use of cell phones and "all electronic devices" while driving. One-handed driving will be next. 🚗📱
So China is waiting and laughing at us. One thing China does that I like is tell the environuts to pound sand when they block progress.
Keystone XL pipeline should be a no brainer. It's sad this country is so tied up in regulations that nothing can get done.
AVG says it protected my PC from 4,954,870 threats in the last 30 days. Is this even possible? It sits idle most of the time.
Planning a lazy evening that hopefully involves Mexican food and loafing at the local gas station. Haven't felt good for days.
Gotta love how Cheney pokes his head out of the hole every so often and disses Bam, then disappears again. He's the GOP groundhog. 😁
I can see why people thru the centuries thought some dreams were from God. It was so vivid. Still feel like I was there. 😌
Church was packed. People sitting in floor. One minute the pastor was speaking, the next Trans-Siberian Orchestra was playing. lol
Haven't been there or seen these people in years. But it was present day setting.
Just had a dream I was at my old church. Seen and talked to pretty much everyone I knew. Got caught up on life. It seemed so real.
Maybe some are annoyed by his public displays of religion. But some are annoyed by this belittling of religious people. Nobody is harmed.
They can criticize his gameplay all they want, even though he's doing good. But you would think he's breaking the law w/ his JC shout outs.
Jesus is his thing. Leave him alone. It's amazing how much political correctness has permeated society without people realizing it.
I don't understand this hatred for Tebow. We still have freedom of religion. Tolerance is becoming a scarce commodity, all around.
Although I disagree that a failing in one area of your life means you will fail in every area of life. Everyone slips. Consider the whole.
Perry looked decent on FNS. I really think his biggest problem is the Texas accent. It reminds those snooty Northeasterners too much of GWB.
Can't believe yesterday was 5 years my father's been gone. Where does the time go?
Go ahead and lose the rest of them, "Skins. At this point I'm rooting for a high draft pick. 😜
But I like it... http://t.co/3gN7NVKs
Big Bad Moon's lookin' down on me tonight.
Perry and Bachmann might get a bump out of this. Otherwise, not much will change.
Turned out to be a decent debate last night. Problem is nobody watches these weekend debates, except for political geeks like us.
There's an undertone to these recent questions that I don't like. They're digging for a "Gotcha!" without being obvious. #IowaDebate
Interesting strategy Perry is using. Defending Newt instead of taking the obvious course.
Another debate tonight. Everyone seems like this one isn't important. The big one is Thursday.
Looking at Christmas lights again.
In another life, I would be...a truck driver.
Haven't did #FF for 2 weeks now. I apologize. 😁
Days are too short. I keep repeating this but I don't like it. Earliest sunset time just around the corner. ☺
I'm gonna marry the night.
Watching a Xmas parade. Everybody seems cold and nobody knows where they're going.
How hopeless do you have to be to shoot your 2 kids and yourself in a welfare office because you were denied benefits? Wow.
Man the snow is really flying now. Shouldn't have spoken too soon. http://t.co/HH52IGiY
December 7, 1941. "will be a day that will live in infamy." I wasn't around 70 yrs ago, but I know history. Never forget. 🇺🇸🇯🇵🇩🇪💣
Latest polling shows Newt @38%, Mittens stalled @19%, Paul @14%, and Perry back up DD @11%. It's not over by a long shot. No panicking. 😚
Just when the Cain Train suspension seemed surreal enough, he apparently quoted Pokémon in his gbye speech. Well...that was a fun ride. 👽
Looks like its gonna be another rainy and foggy night. At least it's not snowing.
Considering the country is still falling apart, that's all he has left. Sad. Complete 180 from '08. 😒
This is a pattern I've seen from him over the last few months. Just never brought it up. His campaign will be based on envy and dividing.
I can't deal with Bam's speech. I'm so sick of hearing him blame certain people for all our problems. He's clearly no longer a uniter.
With so many debates left, we can't say Newt's got this. Except for 2 or 3 of them, they all still have a chance. It continues after Iowa.
This is the point they begin making "outrageous" comments to get attention and differentiate themselves from each other. May be fun soon.
There's already been what—12, 15 of them? They're starting to regurgitate the same Q & A. Guess its ok bc so few are yet paying attention.
The Donald is hosting a debate on an obscure channel. Why all the outrage? With the exception that there are too many debates, period.
Turning the ceiling fan on. It's that warm this morning. 😊 #stayawaywinter
I don't know if Newt is the answer. He'll kick the crap out of Bam in the debates, but is debating all there is to being president?
Gonna be a long, rainy night. ☔☁
Several more debates left. 4 more weeks. There's still plenty of things that can happen.
Cain endorsing Newt is not surprising, but it still too early to endorse, IMO. Wait at least a couple more debates.
Got invited to a church Christmas dinner. Very full now. 😊
The weekend is going too fast. How can I want time to speed up for certain reasons (Boo winter) yet want it to creep by, at least today? 😏
It was sad watching baby turtles getting eaten by seagulls before they even made it to the ocean. 😢
Watching this Oceans documentary on Starz on demand. There's some really funny looking but amazing creatures in there. Sea dragons do exist.
Anything you ever could have remotely done in the distant past will likely come out if you ever run for prez. That excludes most of us.
I don't know if HC really thought all of this stuff wouldn't come out eventually. Then again, we all know O really wasn't vetted properly.
In all fairness though, it's very possible for men and women to be just friends. I'll take his word for it unless more info comes out.
Cain's suspended his campaign today. Prolly means there are more friends of his out there that haven't come out yet.
Hangin out relaxing tonight. About to get some food.🍴
Been playing Angry Birds Seasons all night. Time to take a break.
Decided I'm gonna endorse one of the candidates after the next debate. It's probably not hard to figure out who I have in mind. 😉
They have shrunk the entire labor pool 3 million since 2008. If counted, real unem would be 11.6%. There's lies, damn lies, and statistics.
Also wonder how much stat tinkering is happening. Was a larger percentage of total labor pool discounted and made smaller?
Unemployment rate down to 8.6. Good news, but how many are temp holiday positions? Employers are prepared for	record predicted holiday rush.
#40 Yeah yeah and it's ok	I tie my hands up to the chair so I don't fall that way  http://t.co/BZBeNywG
Busy night at Wallyworld. I've already got my dose of holidays. Bring on the New Year. 🍺
Looks like the Cain Train has been swinging the block a few times.
I bet I spend at least 50% of waking hours staring at some sort of screen. (TV, iPhone, iPad, laptop, old rusty but trusty HP desktop.) 💻
December 1. First day of meteorological winter. 3 weeks til solar winter, and the shortest day of the year. Start countdown to longer days.
So far, his timing is great. Him and Perry are the only ones who will aggressively put the hooks to Bam, if nominated. Verbally, of course.
Gotta hand it to Newt. He's the new GOP star.the question is can he hang on for another 5 weeks. At least he's willing to debate a lot.
Gonna post my top 40 songs of the year over the next few days. 🎤
Darn evenings are too short. Feels late. 🌙
When's the next debate? I need moar dope.
Or, should that be hillbilly flatlander? 😁
Oh geez Perry don't know the correct voting age! That flatlander hillbilly. /sarc
3G is down. Edge is painfully slow. I got spoiled really fast... Hopefully they're installing H+. 😚
There you go. #opinionsoutofnowhere 😏
I'm more pro decriminalization than legalization. There is a difference. It would take care of prison overcrowding overnight.
Why there is a slow nudge towards drug legalization: Government likes a more sedate and passive population. They could get away with more.
Trying to figure out why someone would steal a dirty clothes hamper and not actual clothes in the dryers. 👕
Somebody stole my dirty clothes hamper. Hope they have fun with it lol
Sucks the AT&T/T-Mobile deal is all but dead. I haven't seen anyone with a better plan to cover so many rural areas with 4G LTE in 2-3 yrs.
This mandatory drug testing of half the pop just won't work. Too many legal pitfalls, and somebody will get very rich off selling test kits.
So Newt want drug testing for anyone who gets money from the government. Does this include retirees who worked for years and smoke weed?
Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball. Can I play wit madness? There's no vision there at all http://t.co/Cm7KkCRv
I self censored 2 tweets with off the cuff comments last light. If you missed them, good. If not, good. 😚
I call BS, unless they got a bunch of those old stinger missiles. Regardless, they wouldn't even have a chance to launch them. ❌
Iran says they will fire 150,000 missiles at Israel if attacked. Sounds like that's where the fireworks show may be next summer.
Okay, I was true to not talking politics all holiday weekend. So now, it's back to RSP. 📢
Well the Skins actually squeaked out a win. 4-7 ain't nothing to crow about, though.

Although I sometimes wish things would have turned out differently, all in all, I know I've really been blessed. I'm definitely thankful.
Spending the evening on the road. Love driving. 🚗
Deer hunting and skinning bucks are big around here. These country boys are hard core. I might try it if I didn't have to leave 3G  signal.
Still can't do a Mac. Way out of my price league. But I'm down with their "low end" stuff.
Love this iPad 2. Only time I used my laptop yesterday was to sync devices. I admit, I'm drowning in Apple koolaid right now.
Looks like hoops fans are happy this morning, too. 🏀

Well, I survived Wallyworld last night. Feels like a regular day now.
Looks like the crowd beat me out here. Just got "crop dusted" though. 😳
Reports say Wallyworld is already a madhouse. Wonder how many Occupiers are in the carnage pile?
Sometimes, people are just determined to put you in predicaments when they got it in for you. 👎
Man I'm TIRED of this f❌❌kn 💩.
I gotta question to ask, but since I vowed to steer clear of politics for the weekend, I'll hold off until Monday. 🚑
Haven't ate dinner yet. Think I will gnaw on some blood pressure-raising ham later. 🍴
Deviled eggs were a huge hit. Can't claim all the credit, though. 😊

It might make you lazy and want to eat all the time, but so does TV and the Internet.
No, I don't smoke. Haven't smoked in years. It's ridiculous that drug laws view pot as dangerous as meth and crack. That's clearly not true.
Make it a controlled substance paralleling alcohol and prescription laws. Then tax the crap out of it. This cat's long been out of the bag.
Guess they forgot that the Feds still consider pt illegal. SC says federal law trumps state law, so it will be interesting for future of MM.

Still debating whether or not to go run over some Occupy protestors on Black Friday. There's really nothing I have to have this year.
I think I will take a break from politics over the holiday weekend. It's been a busy week. I'm on sensory overload. 🚥
Considering last night's debate was in DC, it was pretty clear who the establishment likes, judging by who got the most applause lines. 👏
Hope it stays mild like this all winter, even if it's rainy. The grass is turning green again. ☔
Occupy will attempt to occupy stores to protest Black Friday. Getting in the way of a BF Walmart mob? They're crazier than I thought.
Just saw a Honda commercial with a family singing "Crazy Train" in a minivan. I'm officially old. 🚙 😳
Really thinking Perry is being underestimated. This was a good night for him. He has credentials and a coherent plan.
@candacecbure Perry and Newt. Cain seemed to disappear tonight. Romney is still there. Paul is always interesting. The rest don't matter.
Not too bad, even though I missed the first half.
Syria is almost incidental to Iran. By far the biggest problem in the ME. #cnndebate
Perry gave the best answer. We wouldn't be giving illegals as many freebies if they cannot get here in the first place. #cnndebate
Ron Paul is correct on the drug war. It is a waste of money. Legalizing pot would undercut the cartel profits overnight. #cnndebate
Y'all just don't like Rick Perry's accent. 😏 #cnndebate
I've missed half of the debate. Gonna have to watch the replay.
So far Perry sounds best. Much debate to go, though.
Debate in...a little while. 🐘 👍
@EconFree this state has never seen a tax it didn't like. State government has politicians who favor whoever lines their pockets the most.
Pepsi Next coming next year. Sounds like Edge repackaged, which I really hated to see go. But it died out with the Atkins diet about 2005.
WV ranks #55 in economic freedom, out of 57 states. 😁
Ohhh, the debate is tonight. Well shoot fire. Even I can't keep up with these things. 🐘
Is there another debate on tonight? Good lord, people. I don't ever recall this many. 😳
New Apple rumors for 2012 include the elusive iPhone 5 with a 4 inch screen, and an iPad 3. Already have the 4s so maybe I will get the ip3.
I just earned the Trail Blazer Bonus at Mountaineer Mart in MyTown2. #MyTown2
It means people are going places and have stuff to do. Contrast that with a dark, deserted highway.
Everyone hates traffic, but few things make me happier than seeing a busy multilane freeway full of cars. It means things are happening. 🚗
I actually watched last weekend's debate. Not getting much press play. It made republicans actually look like humans with feelings. 😢
Well the GOD Committee was a total waste of time. Could see this coming last summer. Just another "kick the can down the road" strategy. 💰
Well, "The Hoff" just bombed the AMAs at the end. Nice.
Aw man, the 4s emotes don't show up in Chrome. Just squares.
Am I the only one who thinks "photo bombing" is hilarious? Every one I've ever seen has made me laugh. Esp when the "victims" are repulsed.
Even though there's a few hours left, all in all, it's been a great weekend. 👍

I wish I didn't feel the need to talk about this boring stuff. But it will soon affect all of us profoundly if nothing is done. See Europe.
The only other option is spending cuts and freezes across the board. Otherwise we will continue to watch that debt clock spiral into orbit.
Econ 101: we can't increase treasury revenues (code for taxes) long term if there are no additional revenue sources (jobs) being created.
Either way, these dollar amounts are mind-boggling. and we ain't got it.
Repubs submit $525,000,000,000 spending bill to the God committee. Dems hate it bc it doesn't tax the rich enough. Impasse.
Oh wow, they found Waldo Jr. over in Libya trying to escape the country. Wonder what will come of him?

We get it: you hate working, the free market, and soap. Now go back to your basements and boxes for awhile. It's getting cold.
Exercising 1st amendment rights is one thing. Defecating on police cars and trashing the cities is quite another.
And furthermore, every opportunist politician who got in front of this movement owns it. These are your boys. We will remember.
Throw them all in jail if they must. They have already cost taxpayers millions in police and medical services. Send them the bill.
This Occupy stuff is out of hand. Worthless bums complaining there are no jobs, yet blocking everybody else from going to work and school.
Such a cold evening. Getting ready to be warmed up by some Mexican food.

Great line from life's next playwright.
"The jig is up. You only made it this far bc u know the boss. Everyone knows it but you. Leave, while you still have a shred of dignity."
Looks like Perry saved some face last night. Bachmann and Cain was left holding the poopie sticks. But Mitt's hair still didn't move.
Just exceeded my daily recommended saturated fat intake by threefold. But it was one lone bright spot in an otherwise terrible day.
Nah, you know when your welcome is worn out and it's time to move on. I'm the guy who always hangs out a little too long. Literally.
Did Perry screw up tonight? Didn't see the least hour.
You mean it was actually mentioned the we've been in a silent cyber war with China for years? Never thought I would hear that.

I haven't endorsed anyone yet. I get ticked at the unfairness of a 10 second brain fart counting for more than a 10+ year economic record.
Texas is the final frontier of growth and job creation in this horrible economy. That ought to count for something. #Perry
Despite his horrible debate skills, Perry has one of the best records of anybody there. I hope the GOP doesn't live to regret this piling on
In fairness, we all have brain farts. Gosh, I do that all the time.
See what I mean? lol #perryoops
Interesting debate, but I'm really souring on these formats. Specifically designed to get irrelevant 10 second sound bites for news loops.
Okay, I didn't notice anything different at 2. Did the test work?
"Breaker 1-9 for radio check." "Come back, Wilbur. You're breaking up on me."

If Cain survives this, then maybe he should be the nominee. The Clinton of the right. Teflon candidate.
Well...There goes the Jewish vote.  http://t.co/laFtYFOi
Is the next debate Wednesday night? We need more Lincoln-Douglas style debates. That was some good, substantive stuff right there. #2012
LILO serves six hrs of 30 day jail sentence, released due to overcrowding. Don't want that PB shoot to take longer than necessary, do we?
I love DST, where it stays daylight until 9:30 in June. Ppl who hate it r almost always morning ppl bc it's still daylight when they crash.
This time change takes awhile to get used to. I feel slow now.
The 'Skins stink it up again. Same pattern every year: start out decent, get everyone's hopes up, then implode. I must be a masochist.
So Pippa Middleton is supposed to be writing a book on party etiquette. I'd be interested if I could get in to her—party, too.

Maybe I'll get used to it.
This Aluma thingy is already hurting my butt cheek. Not gonna work out, methinks.
Those women should work where I do. We'd love to have them. We have smokers, too. #Cain
Also, Cain's been making the rounds after the "harassment" stuff. I can see a day when we have to look at a wall when talking to coworkers.
Perry's Cornerstone Speech Highlights http://t.co/0BfsNd8A via @youtube
How did I blow $50 at Wallyworld at 3 am? Oh well... At least a got an Aluma-wallet!
It was entertaining, in a drunk, corny uncle sort of way. But harmless. The audience seemed to love it.
Got some Hotcakes earlier. Now watching these shrieking banshees in the media yapping about Perry being high on dope during NH speech.
Been hanging out at work for 13 hours. Craving Hotcakes for some reason. #readytogo

This virtually guarantees that a not-so-distant future president will have to deal with this...yet again. Iraq: take two.

Oh wow. Went to a party, wound up getting fingerprinted and nobody seems to know the purpose. Creepy.
Going to a Halloween party. Wish me luck.
Perry is getting a lot of crap for not wanting to do all the debates, but, maybe he's right. Maybe there are too many of them. 12 more to go

ION, there is "serious concern" in the media that Christie is too fat to be prez. He may spontaneously explode without enough pizza on hand.
Might as well keep their boots on. Gonna have to do this all over again next year, only with Bam and dogcatchers also on the ballot. #wvgov
Earl Ray won, but 3 points is an incredibly tight race. 10 years ago, this would have been a 30 point blowout.  #wvgov

In other news, Dr. Pepper 10 isn't too bad. I'll drink it again. Acceptable caffeine content, too.
Christie getting in will only help Cain and Perry. He will cannibalize Romney and effectively end Huntsman's run. So, go do what you want...
Kick off your house slippers. Put your boots on. Go out and march. Maybe a job will jump out and slap you upside the head.
But, nothing good ever happens on Monday morning, so I shall laith down for now.
I'd like to break these candidates down sometime into electoral votes and which states go into flux depending on the theoretical winner.
Rep primary race summed up: Cain's in to win. Perry's got 1 more chance; dont f this one up. Base still dont trust Romney. Rest dont matter.
Herman Cain is finally in the race. Nice.

Very impractical for mountainous highway driving. At least the Escalade will get you up the grade without needing recharged.
A gasoline powered Escalade will never meet 55 mpg. The only offset is making a bunch of tiny electric cars for people who hate driving.

It's a really dark night. Literally.
It's about this time I really start wanting Xmas to be over with...
Too cold for this early in the winter. Technically, it's not even winter yet.
December 7.
How did I leave a $5 bill on a dryer in a busy laundromat for 45 minutes and it still be there when I got back? Honesty still matters. :)
Enjoying a sunny, warm Saturday in November. Won't be too many left this year.
Sitting outside watching a nice sunset.
In a tweeting mood today, but don't know who will read this crap.
I'm back. Kind of.
Last night was rough. Feels good tonight.
Texas. Broken A/C. Long night.
Got bored with updating. Sorry about that.
Somewhere in TN, outside of Bristol.
Leaving WV for H-town.
Lord, some of the things you see and hear in walmart on the third...
"Hey little sister, what have you done..."
Two more week until vacation. I really need this one.
Oh nice. How could you not love the "99 Red Balloons" remix? :p
The Bell then Wallyworld, then chill all night
U Hauling all day. Fought with a sofa. Took shower. Now need food.
Laundry day... Just realized that NFL preseason has already started. Better late than never I guess.
So I notice that a lot of people's status updates begin with "So". So cool.
What to tweet about? I'll get myself in trouble if I get too unhinged.
One more week, hopefully.
Another lazy Sunday evening. KFC buffalo snackers would be good about now.
After reading old tweets, I notice my command of the English language has deteriorated substantially... IOW, my writin' sucks.
Good morning. Well, it's morning somewhere...
Perhaps we all need a different perspective from the universe: Carl Sagan - Pale Blue Dot  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pfwY2TNehw
Took 2 1/2 hours to remove a fake spyware worm from my computer. Who ever wrote that thing needs to be kicked in the nuts - repeatedly.
I've never been so happy to be woke up this early in a long time. :)
Done. http://yfrog.com/17rlmaj
@pepsi Bring back Blue! I still miss that stuff lol.
Grass is over-rated. I would much prefer a rock garden.
Just finished. Well, as much as I'm gonna do. Called someone else to come and finish it lol.
Taking a break from mowing tall grass on this hot afternoon.
An old cell phone pic. http://twitpic.com/28ec90
Hang around at McDonald's long enough, you will be amazed at what you see...
The more things change, the more they stay the same.
Maybe that should have been, "jackassary".
Nice illusion. http://twitpic.com/277vt3
Ate Mexican. Left a tip despite their jackassery.
Sunsets are nice.
I need caffeine. Lots of it.
It's a new day, fwiw.
Well... Now what?
NM. Just remembered a spaghetti fundraiser going on this evening.
I don't know what to eat this evening. Sick of it all.
How did I spend $11 at Subway? :-/
Not to imply that I will ever be in charge. Many situations are beyond our control.
I'm still not in charge. I sit and wait.
Parking lot sweeper is here. Guess it's time to go.
Standing in Wal-Mart parking lot at 3:40 am talking about "Shit My Dad Says"...
"Lord have mercy... She's having a spell!" -Butch
I like these new Jeep ads... I might go buy 5 tomorrow.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uIBL_ei5VM
I didn't tweet yesterday. I almost didn't today, either.
Should waiters aggressively ask for tips? Something about that really irks me.
Strange... An entire year of my Tweet history is now missing.
Summer is half over already. And Wallyworld is still packed at 10:30 at night. Amazing.
Why does Wal-Mart even drug test prospective employees? Working at that place would drive me to use.
I still love America, even if nobody else does anymore.
Happy 4th, everyone. :)
"Some days, it's just not worth chewing through the restraints.".  --Bonnie
I know I'm not in charge.
Sometimes, you have to wonder who is really in charge...
Wow. Sounds like a bad country song...
3 am. Power is out. Storms are around. Door alarm is buzzing endlessly. No one is up. No one seems to care.
Mmm... Sausage. Last meal of the day. #sausage
Anyone else think the Farmville for iPhone app is kinda clunky, but still addictive?
