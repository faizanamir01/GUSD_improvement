Never doubt the will of the American people. Their courage to fight for a safer America will not be ignored. https://t.co/CNEDaBEAwW #EndGunViolence #CouragetoFight
Over 90 percent of the American electorate is demanding that the Senate move this legislation forward. Voters are watching. When tragedy strikes, they will remember who took action to protect them, and who looked the other way.
Today’s victory in the House is a critical first step toward stronger gun laws that will save lives. The responsibility to take the next step now shifts to the Senate.
Tragically, the cost to our communities while we waited over a decade for this progress has been far too high. Hundreds of thousands of American lives have been lost. Far too many families and communities, including my own, have been forever changed.
When it looked like the gun lobby would forever silence any debate on stronger gun laws, courage shone through. Courage embodied by relentless advocates and resilient survivors, and exemplified by leaders who ran for office and won on the promise to fight for a safer future.
Today’s historic gun safety victory in Congress is a testament to courage. Just eight weeks into the new Congress, courage is what inspired the House to pass #HR8.
It’s a new day in Congress. Today, the House of Representatives will finally deliver more than thoughts and prayers, they'll deliver action. This is the power of our vote. #HR8 https://t.co/tXhTrg7qEG

We will never stop demanding that our leaders listen to the youngest generation and take long overdue action to keep our children safe. We will never forget when the students of Parkland bravely took a stand and called for change. America stood by them and said #NeverAgain.
Yet, since the tragedy in Parkland, more than 1,000 children in our country have been killed by guns. Every American should be devastated by this reality. Every American should be fighting for solutions. #NeverAgain.
We will never accept this horrific act of violence as normal in our society. Our kids should go to school to learn—not to hide under desks and text their parents goodbye. No child, regardless of the neighborhood they grew up in, should live in fear of gun violence. #NeverAgain.
We'll never forget the way we felt one year ago when we learned of yet another horrific shooting, this time at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It still feels impossible to comprehend that 17 people went to school that day and never came home. Remember them today. #MSDstrong https://t.co/0Cpt6vT2gz

Harvey Milk’s life was cut short 40 years ago today. Harvey showed the world how to love without fear. He reminded us to hope. And he left behind a legacy that to this day drives us to fight relentlessly for justice and equality. https://t.co/68k7uqHT8G

Voters made clear Tuesday night that the days of the NRA blocking action to strengthen our gun laws are over. Now is the time to come together and pass legislation that will prevent guns from landing in the wrong hands. Legislation that will save lives.
We shouldn’t have to live in a country where our president and our lawmakers refuse to take any action to address this uniquely American crisis that’s causing so much horror and heartbreak.
Classrooms. Places of worship. Newsrooms. Movie theaters. Restaurants. Yoga studios. Nightclubs. Playgrounds. No place in America feels safe anymore. No other high-income nation has this level of gun violence. I'm heartbroken, angry, and never going to accept this as normal.
307. There have been 307 mass shootings so far this year. Do we really want to raise our children in a country where mass shootings like Thousand Oaks are a weekly occurrence? A country where every single day in America, more than 90 people are killed with guns?
When we launched @GiffordsCourage after the shooting at Sandy Hook, our goal was to challenge the gun lobby. To fight for a future where public safety comes first—not gun industry profits. Last night was an unprecedented victory. Change is on the horizon. https://t.co/t5V7iKN9N3

The transformation we witnessed in the House tonight will lead to safer gun laws that will save lives. We know it may not happen immediately, but we will bring the same fight that we brought to the 2018 midterms to the new Congress. Make no mistake: change is on the horizon.
For the first time ever, candidates—including candidates in the toughest states and most critical swing districts—boldly ran on gun safety platforms, and won. At @GiffordsCourage, we locked horns with the NRA, and came away with victories in states like VA, PA, CO, AZ, MN, &amp; TX.
They said the NRA was too powerful. They said it had too much money, too much influence. They told us change wasn't possible. But we knew better. We knew Americans would stand with us and fight for a safer future. Tonight, we proved them wrong, and we beat the NRA—together.
Congratulations to @ChrisPappasNH for winning your election tonight! Chris has been in the @GiffordsCourage family fighting for gun safety for years. We are so proud of you. #GunSafetyWins https://t.co/w6lnRAr5c5

Every single day, nearly 100 Americans are killed with a gun in our country. We must not only recognize the realities of hatred in our society, but actively work to make it harder for dangerous people fueled by hate to access firearms and murder innocent people.
The alarming frequency with which we watch these terrifying scenes unfold in our communities is devastating – and it’s not normal.
Also this week, Americans also watched in horror as the story of a serial bomber unfolded. Political violence, hate speech, and crimes against the First Amendment have no place in our society.
Just this week, a man in Kentucky targeted an African American church before finding and shooting two victims at a nearby supermarket.
From the Pulse nightclub shooting to the sickening protests we saw unfold in Charlottesville last year to the attack at Mother Emanuel in Charleston, our nation has seen tragedy after tragedy unfold when hatred and bigotry are emboldened.
I’d like to say a tragedy like this is unimaginable, but I can’t.

If gun violence feels like it's become an everyday occurrence, that's because it is. Every single day, nearly 100 lives are lost because of guns. But every time you hear news of another shooting, remind yourself that this level of gun violence is not normal.

Congress can keep our kids safe in classrooms, churches, at concerts, and in arcades. And should they choose not to, then it is our job to do everything we can this November to elect a Congress that will.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this shooting, their families, and their friends. But for those with the power to pass laws that will save lives, thoughts and prayers are not enough. They can fix this.
We do not have to accept these horrific acts of violence as routine. Congress knows steps they can take to stop this madness. Too many of them simply lack the courage to act.

Congress refuses to act—so this year we'll elect leaders who will. This November, we all must vote. We're going to elect gun safety champions that understand the foolishness of a plan like this and will have the courage to pass stronger gun laws. https://t.co/cFyKkO5co4
The President may only listen to special interests that say shootings are acts of evil beyond our control. They are not. Americans are calling on Congress to pass effective laws that protect our kids and keep guns away from dangerous people.
Arming teachers is not a solution. It recklessly puts American children in even more danger. We can forge a better path. It’s time for Americans to find the courage to fight for our own safety.
Teachers are not bodyguards. The Trump Administration’s latest plan to allow more teachers to walk around with guns in order to make kids feel safe is absurd — and dangerous. https://t.co/h4iQFQj531

Should the Senate confirm the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, we have every indication to believe that he will prioritize an agenda backed by the gun lobby, putting corporate interests before public safety.
Judge Kavanaugh’s dangerous views on the Second Amendment are far outside the mainstream of even conservative thought and stand in direct opposition to the values and priorities of the vast majority of Americans.

Congress must find the courage to pass the effective laws that can protect our children and stop dangerous people from accessing guns. And if this Congress won’t protect our kids and communities from gun violence, this November we will vote in a Congress that will.

Instead, he is appearing for an unprecedented third time to support an organization that spent tens of millions of dollars to support him. Donald Trump has allowed his presidency to be hijacked by gun lobbyists and campaign dollars.
Today, we saw no such courage from Donald Trump. It's the job of the President to ensure our public safety, but Trump takes his marching orders from the NRA. It's his job to represent all Americans, but Trump has ignored the pleas of young people demanding safer gun laws.
I've seen great courage when my life was on the line. I've seen courage in young Americans finding their voice and speaking out-demanding that politicians act to keep kids safe. We've seen great courage in Nashville, where a young man faced down death in order to save lives.
It takes courage to fight gun violence. It takes courage to oppose the powerful and the privileged, to stand up against a special interest that spends hundreds of millions of dollars to protect the firearms industry.

America too often distinguishes itself in response to tragedy – honoring the victims, supporting the survivors, even rushing a shooter and saving lives. And too often we fail to do what we can to prevent these shootings from happening in the first place.

It’s time to fight for a Congress that will take the side of the American people who want to see an end to America’s gun violence epidemic. Politicians can find the courage to change by simply listening to America’s call for safety. #NationalSchoolWalkout #ProtectOurSchools
They are warning politicians to show the courage to address our gun violence crisis or get voted out. This anniversary is an opportunity to take a stand, and renew our call for action to keep our kids safe. We will remind our leaders that thoughts and prayers will not suffice.
But after the mass shooting at Parkland, a generation of students declared they would not sit idly by. They would use one of our most powerful tools as American citizens – our voices – to demand a change to the status quo.
In a country where we have not broken the pattern of mass shootings, cycles of violence in urban communities, the deadly nexus of guns and domestic abuse, or the corrupt influence that special interests have on our politics – in this country, kids must still fear for their lives.
Students in America now consider live shooter drills as a routine part of the school year. They have to worry if their school, their community, their friends and family could be next.
After Columbine, America’s politicians said, ‘never again.’ But after nearly two decades of inaction, it’s clear they’ve failed in their basic duty to keep our kids safe. #NationalSchoolWalkout #ProtectOurSchools

This country has never been more angry about political inaction in the face of gun violence, and our demands for a safer future have never been louder.
Our hearts are in San Bruno today, with the victims, their families, and the heroic first responders. Come November, I’m confident that Americans will turn their frustration with a Congress that won't act to protect our safety into a wave that will elect a Congress that will.
How much longer do we have to wait before Congress takes action to make our communities safer from gun violence? How many more breaking news updates about active shooters do we have to live through? How many more lives will be lost?
It’s been 48 days since 17 people were shot to death in Parkland. It’s been 101 days since 26 people were shot to death in Sutherland Springs. It’s been 136 days since 58 people were shot to death in Las Vegas. Every single day in America more than 90 people are killed with guns.

It’s time to turn our outrage &amp; fear into hope &amp; courage. Channeling that energy, we can remind politicians that America must not keep failing its children. We will elect a Congress with the will to change our gun laws to finally make our schools the safe havens they should be.
Today, our hearts are with the victims, the students and teachers of Great Mills High School and our gratitude with the brave first responders who rushed to the scene. Tomorrow, we will follow the lead of students who have said enough.
Today’s tragedy is part of a larger epidemic of school shootings and gun violence that happens every single day, enabled by the refusal of Speaker Paul Ryan to allow votes on safer gun laws.
It’s been more than a month since the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and yet Congress has still failed to protect our children.
Once again, classrooms were locked down and children were forced into hiding. Once again, we heard firsthand accounts from terrified children about what it was like to wonder if they would live or die.
Just days before America’s young people take to the streets to protest the failure of politicians to protect them, a school in Maryland became the latest place where students were forced to run from gunfire.
This weekend, these students – and others from all 50 states – will show the world their power. I can’t wait to join them and #MarchForOurLives. https://t.co/MXf9jRleM6

The question now is if we will find the courage to pass the laws we need to protect our children, to stop dangerous people from accessing guns. And if Congress won't act, American voters must.
My heart is with the victims and survivors, and my gratitude is with Broward County's courageous first responders.
Every day we fail to take action, we chose this fate. We tolerate politicians who fail to acknowledge this crisis and vote against our safety. We let our gun violence epidemic continue day after deadly day.
Defenders of the status quo - advocates of the gun industry &amp; the politicians paid to defend it - will tell you that events like these are virtual acts of nature, products of mental illness or bad parenting, beyond our ability to control. This couldn't be further from the truth.
If I could offer protection to the 315 Americans who are shot every day, I would. But we can't wall ourselves from the threat of gun violence, nor will we find safety in the deadly cycle of arming ourselves against each other.
Even in our grief, we must summon the courage to fight against this fear. We must find the courage to imagine a country where these massacres do not occur. Our leaders must find the courage to escape the confines of their politics &amp; pursue the moral necessity of peace &amp; safety.
But our fear cannot compare to what our innocent children felt as the gunshots rang out, bullets flew through the halls of their school, and their teachers and classmates were gunned down.
The accounts from today's school shooting in Parkland, Florida strike fear into all Americans. Is it safe to send our kids to school? Are we safe in our homes and communities?
When women run, women win. And when women lead, our communities benefit. We can't afford backroom deals that undermine strong women leaders like @LondonBreed. #ItsOurTime https://t.co/PYp9RQqwMW

America’s families deserve leaders who will represent the will of the people, who won’t crumble under pressure from the gun lobby. They deserve leaders who have the courage fight for safer communities.
We expected the same outrage and action from Congress. Instead, we were met with inaction and five years of excuses. Last week, the People's House turned its back on the very people they are supposed to represent and delivered on the gun lobby’s number one political priority.
In response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, a national movement erupted from neighborhoods across America. Parents, teachers, lawyers, doctors, law enforcement officers, and veterans turned their shock into action. They’d had enough. And so had we.

I urge Congress + @POTUS to reject these extreme proposals that pose a serious threat to law enforcement + the American public #Jointsession
The gun lobby wants to make it harder for law enforcement to do their jobs by deregulating silencers &amp; mandating concealed carry
To do this, the Trump Administration should focus on closing the loopholes in our gun laws, rather than following the lead of the gun lobby.
Tonight @POTUS called on Congress to break the cycle of violence in our cities and support our men + women in law enforcement. #JointSession

I pray for the families of those lost, for strength for the injured, and for our first responders. My heart is in Fort Myers this morning.
We have to do better than this, and need to unite as Americans to do more to address the problem of gun violence. #FortMyers
An America where a group of young people - some as young as 12 years old - are confronted by gun violence is not the America we strive for.
Heartbroken to hear that another community has been shattered by gun violence &amp; that young lives have been cut short by gunfire. #FortMyers
Thank you, @DWStweets, for everything. #DemsInPhilly will be amazing because you planned it. And we’ll make @HillaryClinton our president!

I grieve for Jo Cox’s family, friends, constituents, and for the people of Great Britain.
The scores of events that I and so many others like Jo Cox have hosted represent the importance of a democracy connected to its citizens.
The assassination of MP Jo Cox at the hands of a man driven by hatred is a manifestation of a coarseness in our politics that must stop.
Absolutely sickened to hear of the assassination of Jo Cox. She was young, courageous, and hardworking. A rising star, mother, and wife.
