@softedhearts ...with a child. It was really tough. 12 years later I love teaching, my self confidence has sky rocketed, and I’m not my shy self anymore. I’m not saying “just get over it” but it might be beneficial for you to get therapy and try. Who knows maybe some good will come of it.
@softedhearts Hi honey. I’m one of those people who would rather get shot than to present in front of people. I never liked doing it in school or college, and it wasn’t until I was forced to support my baby and teaching was one of the only jobs that allowed a flexible schedule for someone....
