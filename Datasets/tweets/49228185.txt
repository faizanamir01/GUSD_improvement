Boeing employees are constantly laying off because all of those jobs are temporary. Then they lose health care &amp; will have to spend 5x more
If you give people temporary jobs for their vote and &amp; then pass ACHA, they will lose jobs AND health care before Trump leaves office.
Trump's budget calls for total cut of CDBG. ACHA cuts Medicaid. Both pools of $ finance job programs. 100s of 1000s will lose jobs.
Trump talked about peace and love during speech in Saudi Arabia. How can he be for peace and love but build $110 billion worth of weapons?
Do you realize that all the jobs Trump "created" are temporary? Only 35 jobs are permanent from Dakota Pipeline.
