@peterdem0 Most women are not okay with infanticide, or “late-term abortion” to use the watered-down term. The far-left Democrats in New York have made a tactical error, politically speaking. And Northam unintentionally wiped the veneer from Cuomo’s new abortion law, and they want blood.
@peterdem0 No doubt.  He’s heard their discussions and written them checks, allowing them to believe he was a moderate Democrat. He had them eating out of his hand, and Trump waited for the perfect time to run. The Democrats lost their cult leader when Obama was forced to retire.

was forwarding a copy of EVERY email she sent and received, according to @LouieGohmertTX1.
But, due to the fact that Hillary set up a home brew server to avoid FOIA requests, throws the argument made by the #NYSlimes a major curve, because Hillary intentionally sent and received classified information over the server, and a hostile foreign country other than Russia
The #NYSlimes article that accuses @realDonaldTrump of asking Russia to find Hillary’s missing 30,000 emails, makes the grand assumption that Hillary’s server is legit, which it is not. If Hillary had used a https://t.co/T00CiLkbWs account, then Trump’s statement is a little off.
He said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”  That was OBVIOUSLY intended as humorous statement.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump And @SenateDems knew this vote was purely symbolic and a play at winning the votes of moderates who want more border security.  Businesses that employ illegals can’t afford a wall, and politicians in Washington would rather fund social security by taxing illegals than fix it.
