High Water Everywhere. How many people know someone who can't get a job they're qualified for because they don't have good credit? How many know someone houseless living with and helping out a struggling family to keep from being homeless?

@suenosdeuomi @AndrewDavies @democracynow @NPR Yes! Yes they have. They've been and are routinely amazing and their coverage typically includes not an insignificant number of facts that don't get mentioned on any other news sources. I often post Democracy Now posts to NPR to show them just how badly they've been smoked.
@DaceyZelman @democracynow @NPR I know every time they broadcast something and then don't post it. I can count on one hand the times I've missed something. Yes, it's an obsession.
@DaceyZelman @democracynow @NPR I listen from sign on to sign off every day since the summer of 2015. Go ahead, peruse the TL's of every one of their news platforms. I'll wait. Any casual listener can pop off with their "impression". I'm not that guy. I keep tabs. I count words.
@AndrewDavies @democracynow @NPR They sat on USS Liberty for 38 years. Ignored Yemen for nearly 2 Months. The March has been ongoing. 19 Journalists wounded or dead. 525+ wounded by live fire just today. Stretch further you'll get there.
@AndrewDavies @democracynow @NPR Afterthought? Did they tweet re) Dr. Loubani? Rouzan al-Najjar? Seriously. Their primary vehicle is Radio. I don't believe they understood they'd be in the smallest minority that didn't highlight his connection to Palestine, This is a pattern of censorship about touchy subjects.
