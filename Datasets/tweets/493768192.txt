You need to say edge his last day is here. No reason for all this chilling. Stop the puppy mills stop the stores from getting from puppy mills.

Discrimination is everywhere. Not just for people but for animals too. Pitbull‘s are considered dangerous, nobody wants a black animal. And this is because they don’t know anything. A color of a dog or person should not matter. So why does it people? https://t.co/z7W4fmi3j5

So I’m thinking you got the dog show in China get New York with this 30 for your contract questions and questions. Then you got Texas Palm Valley no kill shelter who kills. I think the Lord for cruelty to animals is going to be extended to shelters and I think politics get it out
@moodysally1 @PeterEgan6 Oh come on kid somebody hit the little man with stick a stick. Poor dog in humane treatment maybe boycott China for being in human to God’s best friend he gave us. No not you were killing the animals us who love them
I see that money need to be put forth to ensuring adoptions helping people who need help with their pets getting fixed starving puppy mills I’d rather do that than pay sorry to people just wanna kill them https://t.co/OVo6H8Hodt
New York New York New York not a place I want to go. We’re dog show in dog eat in China. It is just like back 34 year contract shelter a disgrace taxpayers pay attention where your money goes to fix a dog and killed three days later lots of money going to waste https://t.co/OVo6H8Hodt
Everyone going to the dog show her the run get your dog inside the circle before they cook it in a circle. No lie no lie this is a disaster China it’s disgusting. Oh my is that what you want OK Americans let’s see who goes who knows I want to know now https://t.co/DQAZPjqB5V
I’m asking everybody at the dog show show us all your beautiful pictures don’t forget the crowd who is famous who’s Rich who went to such a barbaric event. Let your photo show it off let us retweet them on Twitter thank you https://t.co/ynOhnuVUDe
@chortletown @PoundHoundsResQ Sometimes I believe things are putting hear about let me be an only dog so it makes the chances of finding adoption harder. I say anybody has a dog this dog is good can love Miss gorgeous. Don’t put red lines where there are none
And thank you Ricky Jarvis for being an important person in animal treatment if people don’t want to see your hear about I think the news need to get more involved in more than who is the president and see us people trying to protectOur family lives with our pets https://t.co/ynOhnuVUDe

The shelter has no blankets for dogs I was there last week a little puppy was shaking and crying even the big dogs for a crime they were cold as they had was one of those bedsBut no blankets no toys no human contact.
I’m really kind of afraid to do it but nobody’s going to help out but I guess nobody really knows me anymore so I’m going to try and do this through my community and my fellow animal lover’s here in Twitter.
So I’m laying around here on the bed at Tunica so today I will mostly be in Twitter re-posting as much as I can to save our animals. I’m hoping to put together the tape for my go fund me account which I hope is where I should go for the shelter in my town.

@BilldeBlasio  I say that one is enjoying killing the dogs everyday. Why not start a program to help with getting these shelters to be NO KILL, Better employee's since we have seen how they treat the animals on Social Net.
@BilldeBlasio I hope you are watching your animal shelters. There has to be changes. Money can be given more to shelters so they do not kill anymore.This is one state as a vet., I will let all who listen &amp; I already do that N.Y. have money but no heart, not to go.

@angie_karan Please don't say this dog is walking ti his death?
A Beautiful misunderstood animal. We have cyotes  out back, and a pack of runaways I imagine. So many dump puppies and others  Anyone see that use ur video on cell &amp; hopefully FBI in ur county will handle https://t.co/uzvuF5dTBy
and a bit fiesty. And she was a bit scared. But a fiesty girl easy to train. Dogs with disabilities love like no other!! GO______ Get  this great ol'e senior
OMG! This baby needs a second chance. The reason for 1 thing is it had no life before.I had a 16 mo. old  Frenchie &amp; loved her ,way out in space-mind! meaning she was the best &amp; even though she was deaf &amp; https://t.co/MvXgFkpatk

others items. A microchip in the dog &amp; GPS ,So sorry for the big answer. I just got to get the account I . To many lost animals are missing loved ones at home, &amp; the shelter will kill.
than a picture on line, where most are smiling, jumpin Also a small building(a heated/cooled one, for the lost dogs when yto one will get. Get the baby animal ready for adoption and find them a home with 2
Before they kill them. 99 % if not 100% are Pitty's. The stupid thing inthier minds are so wrong. I would want to work with them &amp; help the people to really see they are more
because we have the only shelter in our county..,I wanted to start a program to help schools lean what happens to animals, &amp; help the PitBull system there. They put up a kill list a couple days-
But I also wanted to help keep our animals safe &amp; warm, or cool.The person working doesn't know what a Misting system is! We are in AL. HOT! But I want to get enough to help the next town
She was the best trained loving fluffy Mia. Since Im home 24/7. But with disability It is never enough $. Now I hopefully am going to start a $ raising for our small towns shelter..
Paula,  I want too so bad. Those babies he brings home to us are beautiful. But $ I do not have. I know I could help because Mia the other dog who passed had some ptsd at 16 mo. &amp;untrained. She was deaf. https://t.co/mBd0q3YAqP
I think maybe 2 of them were used, and he said that they cannot have toys because they will go under concrete wall to other dog. East fix for now (if we got $), is chicken wire under the wall.
Im afraid that I won't get much of anything. Now I got items for the dogs like toys, leashes, snacks even big tubs to get bags of dog food in, to keep off the floors.
Im not sure but I never seen results. Im scared to do a Go-Fund me account 4 our animal shelter. I had asked if others think this is the way to find $ because  the cop I talked 2, not evening care.
My 1st day since my new IV M.S, that I feel good. So I can working on our dogs getting a home, or a new one,
