@MrBill108 Why did the networks yank the ad then?  		Racism.
@MrBill108 The caravan is not an invading army of criminals.  Portraying them as gang members and murderers is as racist as it is inaccurate.  He came down the escalator w the same racism and has been spouting it ever since.  		No need to revisit anything.  I’m good.
@MrBill108 It’s racist because it misrepresents the caravan as violent criminals when in fact the caravan is composed primarily of women and children. Seeking asylum is not a crime, they are refugees, not MS-13 and certainly not cop killers.
@MrBill108 No, it’s super mega racist.  		Fox News yanked it.  That says a lot.

@realDonaldTrump You tweet nonsense sometimes dozens of times a day and this is all you can come up with?  Three words?		Act like a president (I know that’s hard for you) and publicly condemn these acts of right-wing terrorism.  Why haven’t you done that already??		You suck at your job.
For every minute that goes by and @realDonaldTrump doesn't get in front of a camera condemning these acts only magnifies his support of right-wing terrorism.  Not a BS tweet or press release, he needs to address the nation and call for unity.

@MsSaltySquirrel @GOVTWINE I agree 1000%.		I've been in his shoes and felt passionately down to my core that I was super human with abilities no mortal could obtain.   That I alone was destined for greatness no one else could achieve.  		That's what mania does.		He needs help.
@GOVTWINE Kayne is bipolar so I can relate to his state of mind. From what I gather, he is manic and not properly medicated. When bipolar mania is left untreated, it can leave you feeling like a super human that has evolved above mere mortals. We are seeing that. He is ill and needs help.

@scoopstrillacci @Elizabethbryso5 Don't subject yourself to abuse.  Block her.		Your social media is YOUR personal online space.  it should be an experience that you enjoy.  I consider Twitter and FB to be little online parties.  I don't invite assholes to parties, when someone starts being an asshole, they gone!
@scoopstrillacci @Elizabethbryso5 Block her!
@scoopstrillacci @Elizabethbryso5 It boggles my mind.   		The 80s were filled with movies that made light of rape.  Revenge of the Nerds, Sixteen Candles, just off the top of my head.		Very enlightened period from our history to report sexual assault.  🙄

@scoopstrillacci @Elizabethbryso5 You’re welcome. 		And don’t let shitty people silence you.		On FB, a mutual friend of my wife shared her story, on her own, no one asked. A high school acquaintance from 25 yrs ago (a stranger to the woman telling the story) called her a liar!  It was jaw dropping!!
@scoopstrillacci @Elizabethbryso5 Since I blocked her I can’t see what she said.  		And while I’m here, THANK YOU for your bravery in sharing your story.  These stories need to be told, especially now, in solidarity and strength.
@scoopstrillacci @Elizabethbryso5 She called me a rapist so I blocked her.  I have no problem getting into a heated debate and can even let petty insults like dumb or stupid roll off my back. But if you clearly just wanna be an asshole I’m out.  		The irony of accusing me of rape was probably lost on her.

@TheBigBen76 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI 3.  Scope is fully determined by requesting official, again 45.  If 45 wants his kindergarten classmates questioned: so ordered.  If 45 wants Swetnick and witnesses questioned: so ordered.  And testimony is voluntary, forcing testimony requires congressional subpoena.
@TheBigBen76 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI 2. To file charges in the jurisdiction of the alleged crime.  Not sure of statute of limitations even permit.  The key here is background is in no way criminal. If background produces evidence, separate criminal is filed w proper authorities that have jurisdiction.
@TheBigBen76 @MichaelAvenatti @FBI 1.  Twenty yrs federal LEO here, multiple clearances.  A background investigation isn’t a criminal investigation.

@AnthonyKGGarre1 @EsoOrc @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump They aren’t perfect. They don’t find everything. You assault someone with no witnesses and no police report filed, they be hard pressed to discover it. If your victim vanishes out of your life never to be seen, chances are the FBI won’t find out.  It’s possible.  It can happen.
@AnthonyKGGarre1 @EsoOrc @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump The timeline of the allegation is irrelevant if the FBI wasn’t previously aware of the misconduct.  New allegations require a supplemental background, which is what’s happening.
@EsoOrc @AnthonyKGGarre1 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump I concur.  I had a clearance for 20yrs, vetted every five.  		Passing backgrounds #1-3 doesn’t protect me from new allegations on background #4, regardless the period of my life that the allegations surfaced in. 		Don’t work like that.
@Becs03360094 @realDonaldTrump And the scope will be whatever Trump decides it will be (he has indicated deference to McConnell.)    The limits and scope are entirely up to Trump.
@Becs03360094 @realDonaldTrump GOP politicians are terrified of Trump's base.  Trump rage tweets about a GOP politician and that official has their life and career changed for the worse.  		The are 100% terrified of Trump and his political wrath.  Trump can ruin any of them with a single tweet.
@Becs03360094 @realDonaldTrump Previous background checks are irrelevant when investigating new allegations.  I had one for 20yrs, I passed backgrounds 1-3, doesn't protect me on background #4 if new allegations arise. Not how it works.		Trump has repeatedly called the FBI corrupt.

4.  And BTW, she was on the "list" of 65 high school girls that vouched for his character. She recanted.  Anyway, I don't think we should hire him after he bombed the interview with lies. Find a better candidate that is more above reproach than this creepy predator.
3.  ...drank root beer floats with her at the Five and Dime. They were bragging about sexual conquests. Ms. Renate took deep offense to the yearbook entry because, I would imagine, she knew their character and knew exactly what they meant. She was quoted as such.
2.  A Devil's Triangle? Not a drinking game. The Seven Fs is a common slang term that does not mean someone was stuttering. A large group of jocks in a pic with the caption "Renate Alumnus" does not mean they were in a prayer group with the young lady or...
1. Confirmation hearing isn't a court of law.  It's a job interview and the applicant suuuuuuucked.  		Kav lied about a great many things in his testimony about his yearbook. He does have the comfort of plausible deniability and can easily hide behind a ridiculous lies.

@bucksawyer4 @TheLastRefuge2 I may be against Kav on a personal level, but I fully support a confirmation free of doubt and above reproach.  If the FBI is unable to uncover anything compelling, put Kav on the bench.

@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr Good talk.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr A confirmation hearing isn't a court of law, it's the worlds most intrusive job interview.  It's not a matter of legality, its a matter of character.  If the hearing surfaces criminal wrongdoing, said crimes are prosecuted in the courts, not the Senate.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr How many federal background investigations have you been subject to and passed?  I know exactly what I'm talking about.  I've had my family, friends, teachers, former bosses all interviewed for my investigation. If a new allegation arose, a new investigation would have followed.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr And you didn't dispute my point about the backgrounds.  It's simple: new allegations require new background.
@andypanda1221 @EdKrassen @SenateMajLdr How do you know its a farce? How about we see and hear from everyone involved under oath: the accused, the accusers, witnesses, and allow them to be cross-examined?  What's the harm in that? Why all the secrecy and hiding?

@whimzies4me @NBCNews They're a hate group targeting immigrants.   Xenophobic fits.
@whimzies4me @NBCNews I never disputed the 142.2 billion.		What I dispute is that illegals (absent children) get the vast majority of federal benefits you claim that they do.		Its against the law, it cant' be done other than with a fake ID.  You think millions of immigrants have fake IDs?  Millions?
@whimzies4me @NBCNews Keep getting your "facts" from a xenophobic hate group, I'll look elsewhere.  And that's not a link.  Its a pic, where from?  Yes, we spend tax dollars on illegals, I've yet to disagree with you on that. 		Illegals (absent children) do not get welfare, food stamps, or Medicaid
@whimzies4me @NBCNews 2/2 ....aren't going to subject themselves to law enforcement scrutiny.  They are actually more law abiding as a whole as legal citizens because of that very fact.
@whimzies4me @NBCNews I will concede most of what you had in your list to varying degrees.  However, illegals cannot receive the vast majority of federal benefits like welfare and food stamps. The only way it is possible is with a fake iD. And millions of fakes aren't out there because illegals.. 1/2
@whimzies4me @NBCNews And the DLs in the 12 states do not allow them to receive benefits.  Most have a distinctive marking on it that preclude benefits.   See for yourself.  If you don't trust the website, they have PDFs of the laws you can review for yourself.		https://t.co/8bxByC4GAb
@whimzies4me @NBCNews FAIR?  		They check out as EXTREME RIGHT BIAS on media bias watch dog groups.		They are also considered a HATE GROUP by the Southern Poverty Law Center.		They also have ties WHITE SUPREMACY GROUPS.		So, your "source" is a joke.		https://t.co/ThtvU7Qb6p

@andypanda1221 @MichaelAvenatti I look forward to chatting with you about this in a week's time after testimony is given by witnesses and three women give their account as the latest news is claiming might happen.  It will be interesting to say the least.
@LisaSwartz8 @whimzies4me @NBCNews Much obliged for the assist.  There's tons of this out there readily available, but it doesn't fit the xenophobic narrative and thereby brushed aside as untrue.
@whimzies4me @NBCNews So millions have fake IDs to perpetrate fraud, thereby placing them in the crosshairs of LE? Because you have to have a valid ID to get benefits.They don't had out benefits to illegals, doesn't work like that.		SCOTUS gives the RIGHT to a free public education to all. Look it up.

@Deplorabelle @jasoninthehouse I was enjoying our debate until you decided to introduce insults.  If you aren’t going to be civil and respect a contrary opinion I will go about my day and wish you the best.
@Deplorabelle @jasoninthehouse I can certainly call Chaffetz nonsense.  He’s a brainwashed moron peddling conspiracies more laughable than Flat Earth.  		Bob Woodward on the other hand, is far more credible source than Chaffetz could ever dream to be.  You should read this new book.
@Deplorabelle @jasoninthehouse We’re talking about Sessions, not Mueller. I’m not seeing anything about Sessions in what you provided.  Maybe I missed it?  Are you proposing Sessions was planted by the deep state to help take down Trump?
@Deplorabelle You haven’t given any facts about Sessions.  Sessions refusing to skirt the law and unlawfully protect the subject of a criminal investigation makes him impartial, not part of the Deep State.  Protecting his boss would be more in line w conspiracy.
@NBCNews This is called socialism.  		When the GOP practices it, they call it a “bailout.”		So much winning.

@Deplorabelle You apply a level of intelligence to Sessions that doesn't exist.  He's incapable of that level of deception.
@Deplorabelle Interesting.
@Deplorabelle I see.		So what about the Republicans that made his appointments?  Bush 43? Rosenstein?  Where do they land in the world of the Deep State?
@Deplorabelle Mueller is also a Repub, appointed to lead the FBI by a Repub, also appointed Special Prosecutor by a Repub.  		So my question is this, is the Deep State a bipartisan organization?  So, the country can't be governed in the spirit of bipartisanship but it's destruction can be?

@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley The statute of limitations for felony sexual assault in Maryland has no expiration.  Just FYi.   https://t.co/D4GciPZdEb
@realDonaldTrump If you truly are the champion of transparency and expedited justice, then release your tax returns like every president before you did over the past four decades.  Show us that you have no financial ties to a foreign power that would impede your ability to govern.  We'll wait.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I think her primary concern is her and her family's safety.  She wants assurances she and her loved ones will be safe if she testifies.  Can't fault her for that.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley It's clear that Dr. Ford knows she isn't getting the FBI involved.  As long as both parties get their chance to testify in front of the American people, I, as a citizen, will be satisfied.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley You should see my FB page.  LOL
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I love intelligent debate, I can do it all day so long as both parties show respect.  I bow out when it gets ugly.  Life is too short.  :)
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I applaud your civility and good manners.  It's refreshing. I'm sure neither of us see that a lot on Twitter.  ;)
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Well I guess I need to keep up on current events.  LOL
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley It is the FBI's job if they are compelled to do so by the Prez.  Kav is Trump's nominee, Trump is the only one that can compel the FBI to open background investigation number seven.  But he won't.
@Champenoise46 @realDonaldTrump I just got out of bed.  I'm good.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley I propose that they speak to witnesses, the accused, and the accuser.  They haven't done any of that yet.  They need to.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley No one has submitted anything under oath that I'm aware of in regards to the alleged incident.  The committee hasn't even met in session to discuss the matter.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley More than a letter.  Subpoena witnesses and put them under oath so lying has consequences.  Conduct an investigation, a real one.  If the facts can't be gathered and credible evidence cannot be obtained, so be it.  But an attempt needs to be made.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 4/4   No one is saying Kav should be prosecuted for a crime, only that the truth be uncovered so the American ppl know who they are putting on the bench.  Remember, confirmation hearings are not a criminal court, its a job interview and we want his full resume, all of it.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 3/3.  If, during the course of a background inv. it appears a crime has been committed and credible evidence is gathered, it is forwarded to the proper auth. in the proper jurisdiction.  In this case the SOL is long expired so criminal charges cant' be filed.  ......

Background inv. dig into everything, I know because I was fed law enforcement for 20yrs and had my background done every five years.  Jurisdiction is irrelevant in a background inv. because no one is on trial.   ......
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley You're fixating on it being a criminal inv., its not.

@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 2/2...	3.  Sex. harass. isn't a crime the FBI investigates, so why would they have jurisdiction simply because they were both fed employees?  	4. If the FBI can be prompted by the WH to investigate sex. harrass. claims, they can certainly investigate an alleged attempted rape.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 1. Placing the letter in the file is not a thorough investigation. Interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence is.	2. The FBI didn't have jurisdiction in 1991 because they were fed employees, they had jurisdiction because the WH gave it to them. 1/2...
@RepRalphNorman Shame on you for making jokes about a rape allegation.  You should apologize and resign.   You are a bad person.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley 2/2.   If credible evidence of a crime is uncovered in the course of a background investigation, the FBI can open a criminal investigation.  But, jurisdiction as you pointed out, does not apply and the matter would be given to the State.
@HARyder @senorrinhatch @ChuckGrassley Confirmation hearings are not a court of law to mete out justice,  they are job interviews conducted by the American people by way of the Senate.   The FBI conducts background and if so ordered by the prez, can reopen the background to follow up on allegations.    1/2 ......

A proper investigation needs to be conducted.
@ldsknack @senorrinhatch A confirmation hearing isn't a court of law, its a job interview for lack of a better term and the Senate literally is a representative body of the public: "We, the People."   We are the ones conducting the job interview by way of the Senate.  Nothing is really "standard."
