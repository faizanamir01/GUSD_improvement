@mrmr28Jan شهر أفريل (أبريل) والان يتم استلام ملفات الترشح، وجماعة الرئيس رشحته لعهدة خامسة بالبرغم من حالته الصحية.
@mrmr28Jan هذا التوقيت هدفه الضغط على بوتفليقة لعدم الترشح،
@nmkhadijax When we thank Allah, Allah will give us more! 😊
@creatvrefear 4-It should be "خالد وأمجد وأحمد عراقيون "	Without the pronoun "هم" and the word "عراقيون" is with "و" not "ي"
@creatvrefear 3- it should be "نحن جدا مشغولون" you misspell the word "مشغولون" that means busy (pl)	The sentence is correct and makes sense :)
@creatvrefear 2 - it should be "هم متخصصون في اللغة العربية"	as the first sentence, "متخصصون" should be written with "و" not "متخصصين" with "ي" in this case.	and you forgot the "في" which means "in" :)
@creatvrefear 1, it should be "المترجمون في مكتبي", You got two things wrong:	the word "المترجمون" in this case should be with "و" not "المترجمين" with "ي" before "ن".	and the word "مكتبي" you wrote "مكتب" and that means an office, while "مكتبي" with "ي" means my office :)
@creatvrefear They do make sense, and honestly the effort you made is very impressive for a beginner, beside your calligraphy is way better than mine and I have been writing Arabic my entire life!	But, they are not technically "correct"!	I will try in this thread to show you why!
@creatvrefear As you can see it can be very automatic, by adding certain suffixes or prefixes to the root of the verb. May Allah bless you.
@creatvrefear أنا أعمل	أنت تعمل	أنتِ تعملين	هو يعمل	هي تعمل	نحن نعمل 	أنتم تعملون	هم يعملون	هن يعملن	There are couple of pronounces are missing though.
@creatvrefear Interesting point! most scholars refused it and called it a Bida'a. But the fact that you as a revert was reminded of the christian hymns is a strong point to prove that this practice is bida'a and also harmful.
