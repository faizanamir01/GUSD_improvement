@LadyThriller69 @4084Mr You are correct Trump supporters are not racist.  We are hardworking individuals who believe in the American Dream!   Stay strong.  Thanks for this post.
@JackPosobiec @Disney His apology is not sincere.  He’s just trying to save his career.  Paula Dean lost everything when they dragged up a word she used in the 60s.  This man made these comments recently.  He needs to GO!!!!!!
