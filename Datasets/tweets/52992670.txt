(3/3) "If that was the case," Sharon added, "I'm sure in 1 hour, there would be no more Mexico."		There was an awkward silence, then Bush shook his head.		"Why?" Bush asked.		"Why what?" Sharon replied.		"Why 1 hour?" Bush exclaimed, "In 10 minutes there would be no more Mexico!"
(2/3) The meeting was during the height of the 2nd Intifada. 9/11 didn't yet occur and Sharon wanted to be sure Bush understood Israel's need for self-defense:		"Mr. President, you were Governor of Texas," Sharon said, "Imagine if Mexico fired rockets over the border into Texas."
(1/3) The ongoing Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza and Israel's need to defend its citizens from them remind me of a personal story.		In March 2001, I accompanied then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for his 1st meeting with then-US President George W. Bush at the White House.

A Palestinian terrorist murdered a Jew. Abbas refused to condemn it. His office instead condemned @USAmbIsrael's shiva visit to the victim's family and awarded a lifetime salary to the terrorist's family. If you think Israel or the USA is to blame for lack of peace, think again.
This Shabbat, our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Yotam Ovadia z"l, who was stabbed to death yesterday by a Palestinian terrorist. The world must hold Abu Mazen accountable for paying terrorists to murder Jews.

Any real honest broker would address the situation on both sides, not just on one side as the statement from #Paris wrongly did.
The biased statement from this summit proves the French government isn't capable of being an honest broker in the Middle East peace process.
It didn't mention repeated #Palestinian rejection of #peace deals. Only mentions the so-called "settlement activity" &amp; "Israeli occupation."

Shine your bright light upon those trapped in the @UN's utter darkness &amp; spread the truth to those trapped in the @UN's falsehood. #YUNMUN
Unlike the real @UN, the General Assembly chamber here at #YUNMUN is not an assembly of eternal falsehood and utter darkness.
#UNSG's claim is false. It gives a green light to #terror. Instead of spreading lies like this, the @UN should be spreading truth. #YUNMUN
It takes two to make #peace, but only one to make war. And it's the #Palestinians making war. #YUNMUN
In @nytimes op-ed, #UNSG defended his disgraceful remarks, writing that “history proves that people will always resist occupation.” #YUNMUN
Last month, Ban Ki-Moon addressed the Security Council and justified terror, by saying “it is human nature to react to occupation.” #YUNMUN
I say to all in the @UN: No more double standards. No more triple standards. Treat #Israel fairly and equally! #YUNMUN
Many speak of double standards, but the @UN has a triple standard: One for democracies, one for dictatorships, and one for Israel. #YUNMUN
@UN accuses Israel of “disproportionality” – I accuse @UN of disproportionality. 20 resolutions singling Israel is disproportionate! #YUNMUN
But over twenty resolutions singled out and condemned Israel. Human rights abusers like Cuba, Venezuela, PA all got a free pass. #YUNMUN
In the 2016 @UN session, one resolution condemned #Iran, one resolution condemned #Syria, and one resolution condemned #NorthKorea. #YUNMUN
And what’s been its latest political interest? None other than to bash the one and only #Democratic and #Jewish state of #Israel. #YUNMUN
This isn’t just an “automatic majority,” it’s an “autocratic majority,” and it stands for political interests, not for human rights. #YUNMUN
These countries all vote together in one big voting bloc. And they make up nearly two-thirds of the @UN General Assembly. #YUNMUN
These are countries which can’t make the easy decision as to whether they should align themselves with democracies or dictatorships. #YUNMUN
And one-hundred-nineteen member states belong to the “non-aligned movement” – a group not aligned with any of the major superpowers. #YUNMUN
Twenty-two member states belong to the #Arab League. Fifty-seven member states belong to the Organization of #Islamic Cooperation. #YUNMUN
The @UN has 193 member states. Some are democratic but most are dictatorships. Some are free countries, but most aren't free at all. #YUNMUN

In his remarks, #BanKiMoon betrayed his job &amp; undercut credibility. @UN should promote reconciliation &amp; peace, not give free pass to terror.
For the @UN to suggest otherwise would imply a lack of understanding and cause a major disservice to morally decent peoples everywhere.
The #UNSG should acknowledge that the #Palestinians are to blame for the collapse of negotiations and that they are inciting #terror.
It's inappropriate to justify #terror, especially on the day #Israel buried #ShlomitKrigman z"l, who was killed by #Palestinian terrorists.

Instead of boycotting #Israel, the #EU should condemn #Palestinian #terror &amp; stand with #Israel as it protects itself from vicious attacks.
It encourages #Palestinian #terror against Israel, as we saw this week in #Otniel, where #DafnaMeir was killed by a #Palestinian terrorist.
The #EU decision to prohibit business w/ #Israel beyond the green line is an act of political warfare &amp; lets the PA get away w/ incitement.

Additional #Israeli consulates should be inaugurated in US cities such as #Denver, #NewOrleans, #SanDiego, and #Seattle, to name a few.
It's therefore self-evident that instead of closing @IsraelinPhilly, we should open more consulates in new cities of importance in the US.
In order to do so, #Israel must combat the false propaganda of all radical Islamic diplomatic missions in the United States.
@IsraelMFA, however, has only 9 diplomatic missions in the US. These statistics show the need for increased hasbara, even in that region.
The @StateDept lists 121 diplomatic missions of Islamic countries in US, excluding honorary missions &amp; @UN missions. https://t.co/Oxm2NttTdO
And as always, #Israel can and will do everything possible to defend itself and secure its people.
Otherwise #Iran will continue seeking nuclear weapons capabilities, undermining regional stability, and sponsoring #terror.
There must be an appropriate response of punishment for each and every violation committed by #Iran.
It must be verifiably ensured that #Iran isn't secretly continuing to develop nuclear weapons capabilities.
The international community must hold #Iran's feet to the fire and monitor all nuclear facilities, military sites, and suspicious locations.
But these sanctions will have little impact since the rest of the world is resuming trade and #business with #Tehran.
#Israel deeply appreciates the sanctions enacted yesterday by the United States against #Iran's missile program.
And not surprisingly, we continue to see #Arab countries, one after another, cutting diplomatic ties with #Tehran.
#Iran continues to enrich uranium, spin centrifuges, without closing down a single nuclear facility.
#Iran continues to have #Christians jailed, #journalists hanged, and #American boats seized.
#Iran continues to sponsor #terror around the world &amp; will increase global #terror activity with money it got this week in sanctions relief.
#Iran continues to test intercontinental ballistic missiles that are capable of reaching as far as the United States.
#Iran's attitude towards us has not changed and we must not change our attitude towards #Iran.

#ParisAttacks cannot be blamed on financial distress, lack of rights, or #Israeli settlements. @MargotWallstrom must stop justifying terror.
The root cause of these terrorist attacks is an existential threat based on the fanatic ideology of radical Islam.
The root cause of #terror isn't deprivation of rights. #Ghandi was deprived of rights but never sent people to blow up buses &amp; restaurants.
The root cause of #terrorism isn't poverty or the deprivation of rights. #BinLaden wasn't poor. He was wealthy and well-educated.
These #terror attacks occurred long before #Israel retook control of #Judea and #Samaria.
For half a century prior to the re-establishment of Israel, Jews, Christians, and other non-Muslims were murdered by Palestinian terrorists.
Swedish FM @MargotWallstrom thinks #ParisAttacks are due to so-called Israeli occupation, poverty, and deprivation of rights.		 She's wrong.

May each and every one of us merit to see our eternal and united capital of Jerusalem completely rebuilt in the very near future.
On this day, we say to all who sought and still seek to destroy the Jewish people: You have failed and you will fail.
As this year, Tisha B'Av falls out on Shabbat, it's instead being commemorated one day later, Saturday night to Sunday, the tenth day of Av.
Tisha B'Av was even the date that saw the beginning of deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka.
During these times, Tisha B'av became identified with many expulsions, libels, and massacres against our people.
We commemorate the destruction of our Temple, which began the Jewish people's travel into an exile lasting for almost 2,000 years.
Today, the Jewish people commemorate Tisha B'av, the ancient national day of mourning, and the saddest date on the Jewish calendar.

His eligibility for parole should not be met with opposition. It's time for Jonathan Pollard to come home.

Let's recommit ourselves to preventing further terrorist attacks like the one in Tennessee and to making a more secure world for us all.
The fight against radical Islamic terror is existential, both to US and to Israel. We are stronger when we face these challenges together.
Our condolences are with the families of those killed and we send our best wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured.
The people of Israel strongly condemn the terrorist attack that occurred last week in Tennessee.

My statement upon meeting today with Foreign Minister Bert Koenders of The Netherlands:		This deal with Iran is... http://t.co/Tc4dT60iIr
It means the end of the NPT, and other countries such as Cuba &amp; Venezuela will follow Iran's lead &amp; build nuclear weapons capabilities also.
It means there will be a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which makes the world's most dangerous region even more unstable and unsafe.
It means the Ayatollahs can retain their nuclear infrastructure to destroy Israel, Europe, and the Americas. #IranDealVienna
I met today with Foreign Minister Bert #Koenders of The Netherlands to discuss why this #IranDealVienna is very bad. http://t.co/qIjqHJOLMo
This deal with #Iran is very bad news and as far as Israel is concerned we know how to defend ourselves and prevent another Holocaust.

We will continue to fight libels that fail to recognize our right to self-defense against an internationally-designated terror organization.
No delegitimization and no bias from any @UN affiliated groups will deter us from defending ourselves against terrorism.
We owe both our lives &amp; our future to them. Our heartfelt condolences remain with the beraved families who lost loved ones in this conflict.

Especially in our historic homeland. Should Judea and Samaria be Judenrein?
