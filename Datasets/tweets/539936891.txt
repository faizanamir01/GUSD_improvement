@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris That’s my point. There are many different reasons why. Of course she only finds a specific example that could be explained (not racism) but only cites a number
@BreitbartNews He’s never kissed the butt of Joe Biden therefore you can cross child molestors off the most.
@MNfrankie It could be the author (FM) writes content worthy of reading and sharing. High school sports coverage is an amazing tool that introduces so many folks to the athletes in our area. It shares their stories, triumphs and losses. Many times it’s the backbone of small towns.
@KamalaHarris Holy smokes. The three states cited for this embarrassing (according to the article, apparent racist Edu spending) are CA, NY, and NJ... who have 1 thing in common - run by DEMs. Crazy and pathetic. Do better
@KamalaHarris Where? Here in our area of S.C. those districts receive nearly the double amount of per pupil spending. Also, do you account for / factor for costs such as higher utilities, building costs associated with schools? Those have zero to do with curriculum.
@ewarren Your boss, Nancy just asked, “how are we going to pay of it?” so good luck
@KamalaHarris This has been going on since the Carter years. What policies do you have that or are you just spouting off “new ideas” that are 40 years old?
@JenniferDebnam @PattyMurray @amprog Exactly! This staffer actually has a Brain and is absolutely correct. I bet they wrote her speech. Because she has to look down every three seconds. Clueless as usual unless it’s “Orangeman bad. No wall”
@ewarren You’re at 10 points. You need to step it up or it will be an early exit.
@steph93065 @KamalaHarris Rent relief= take tax payer dollars and pay off the mortgages for land owners thereby increasing their wealth and further steepening the income divide. Kamala isn’t very smart or is she just trying to help the wealthy?
@JenniferDebnam @PattyMurray @RepChuyGarcia Nancy and chuck wouldn’t allow her to go even if she wanted to.
@roxelie59 @adallin @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP An “expert” was jailed for lying about the EPA. Another from the UN got caught in a hot mic that global warming was a tool to get rid of capitalism.
@JCI_JohnEvans @SenSchumer That’s cool. Can we add in a right uh a judge to declare someone mentally incompetent or unable to own weapons, then finally put the gun debate to bed?
@SenSchumer What is meaningful? Like where is the line of safety measures that will inhibit the wrong folks from obtaining guns and using them and not infringing on good folks’ rights (2nd Amend)?
@zion_coker it’s about that time https://t.co/7ceLBcipTm
@KimpsonForSC Holy smokes! They are still in “denial” at least publicly.
@adallin @SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP https://t.co/f2iMrV1Th8
@KimpsonForSC Yes!
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr @SenateGOP Can the US police the world? our footprint is already declining.
@Bakari_Sellers @alicia71181 Can’t believe the Gov of VA’s wife... after her husband shown with Klan outfit, hands out cotton to only children of color during the state house tour, and talks to them abt it being unpleasant to pick. How and the terrible institution of slavery, lady? Unpleasant, really? 😡
@ewarren https://t.co/h8CL1whyw1
@ewarren https://t.co/h8CL1whyw1
@SenGillibrand So you’re saying what the Podesta brothers did was wrong?
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Research trafficking methods. I have. They say and do anything.
@ACTBrigitte An Educator, Soros Puppet, a drunkie, and an anti-Semite walk into a bar.
@AOC Very true! Law school and medical school tuition plus the costs of living, like food and rent and gas and laundry, these things are mostly only available to students who come from backgrounds with extra resources.
@PattyMurray They may be temporarily separated to make sure they are trafficking victims, but you voted for murder of babies. You saying there is no difference?
@ElectCDavis @GabrielaMcNiel @PattyMurray Most of the cases apparently accused by other minors. And this apparently has been a problem going back to previous Admin. Why are we just hearing about it now? Oh yeah.. media
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris You ever hear of traffickers? The kids need to be verified, then yes, immediately give back to parents after verification.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Or those where parents cannot be verified?
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris I didn’t say “with their family.” What happens to unaccompanied minors?
@ewarren What criminal implication was there? You are an attorney and should know the laws better.. heck you’re in Congress who makes the law. Smh. “Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates.” Was the one thing you had. HAD
@DarenStoltzfus 😈
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris That was part of a sad movement. I didn’t say BLM. I said some folks. The cop killings was in response to the movement. Well documented. Also documented that BLM denounced the Texas shooting.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Tough one. How about remove them from possible dangers, first and sort out facts. Still no answer about the kids who can’t be identified. She tells half the story. An answer to that would tell the whole truth.
@JCI_JohnEvans @RepCunningham Laughter is the best medicine
@fjdinardo @DonaldJTrumpJr Because discord among Americans leads to outrage and disrupts peace and unity. A unified country is a strong one. See also, 9/12/01.
@PattyMurray Not true. It has nothing to do with cancer screenings or well being health care. It’s strictly regarding abortions and money (tax payer dollars) PPH uses to back door fund lobbying efforts. It’s not fair to use tax $ to lobby candidates many wouldn’t support their $ going to.
@RashidaTlaib @AOC Nice! Good work and great question.
@Refinery29 @AOC It’s a right afforded to someone by who? What document or other instrument says this is a right? I’m with you that wages have been stagnant too long, but what is the “right” you speak of? Also,  is $32,200 a year ($15 per hour) a livable wage?
@Eagle_Woman_ @TrulyTrumpette @assilem4791 @Annakhait @Complex I don’t have a problem wit the idea, just the execution. 1. That small amount of money isn’t fixing the real issue. 2. How would anyone be able to determine who gets the reparation?

@Jim_Jordan Short answer: a Dem President declaring it, then they say Trump wasn’t right so the new Pres has to to do it.
@SpeakerPelosi Thread is a snowstorm of ❄️ you are complaining about Matt yet Adam S can say what he wants to the press without regard for the truth even. How many lies did he tell about an investigation on national TV and twitter?
@AOC Umm there are hundreds of screen shots of your original proposal which had salaries for those “unable or unwilling” to work
@NShrubs @PattyMurray CNN 👍 really?
@sarahannebellCO @PattyMurray She didn’t go for cloture last night? Read the bill.
@KamalaHarris What happens to the kids who cannot be safely reunified? How will you know if theirs claiming to be are rightful parents?
@SenKamalaHarris You may find more time to actually do what you were elected to do, if you weren’t flying around campaigning for President.
@PattyMurray And you participated in the “vote” to allow doctors to look the other way as a child dies after birth, last night. But you’re whining over a nomination?
@KamalaHarris https://t.co/nkoo4fZG9z
@ElectCDavis @AOC What is a livable wage? I’ve seen $15 an hour thrown out but is that? $31,200 a year supporting a family?
@RepCunningham Party over LoCo. Not 1 single vote that wasn’t party. What over reach? Are you saying the President doesn’t have the power to do this? That’s crazy because the last 3 Presidents used it approx 30 times. And one did so for “National” Emergencies 7 times ON ANOTHER CONTINENT. 🤷‍♂️
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Not sure what in that text implied I said that. However in MN they did chant “pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon” then walked back it’s meaning. I don’t have a clue as to what is their actual, achievable goal.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Which then led some folks to then murder innocent police?
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris BLM started because a Hispanic Jewish guy wanna be cop murdered a kid under an egregious use of the stand your ground law?
@KamalaHarris What movement?
@AOCortex2020 @Rae_Dawn_Chong @KamalaHarris Trayvon was killed by a Hispanic man, no?
@JCI_JohnEvans @JackPosobiec No idea, man. My point is $33K doesn’t touch what needs to be done. We need to be providing massive overhauls in education that leads to real jobs. That beaks cycles of poverty and inequity.
@SenGillibrand What rights are in danger? Women? Children?
@assilem4791 @Eagle_Woman_ @Annakhait @Complex 4. Instead of reparations, I think we need to look at what creates a balance. “You can’t tell a man to pick him self up by the bootstraps if he has no boots.” Hence you can’t fix 227 years of income inequality with $33,000.
@assilem4791 @Eagle_Woman_ @Annakhait @Complex 2. Kamala’s father admitted his family owned slaves in Jamaica. 3. The idea that the US was full of slaves is very wrong. Majority of Africans sold went to Brazil and Caribbean. Est 400K came to US over the 227 year period.
@assilem4791 @Eagle_Woman_ @Annakhait @Complex 1 Like 25% (not the rich 5%). Also it is known poor white people fought in the civil war to protect the institution because they feared being seen equal to a slave if freed. I think the idea of reparations is bad, (humans are worth more than $33K) we need to be real with facts
@JackPosobiec My family was poor as hell growing up. The best I can tell, it’s pretty much always been the case, generation after generation of carpenters and other similar trades.
@PattyMurray Voted infanticide again. Washington should be very proud. The latest bill was specifically written that doctors had to provide care for a living child.
@JCI_JohnEvans @qanon76 🤪
@justarascal2u @AdamSchiff A discussion worth having be one that included all information, correct? If any plan created 5M jobs but got rid of 6M jobs, would that be good? Likely not

@TheOfficialPORP @cdoyle222 @alicia71181
@HPUFan I’m sorry you’re upset with success. When the goal is to educate children and provide an opportunity for success beyond high school, who could be against us? It’s a shame you don’t like seeing children succeed.
@StephHaynes_ @OCA_Landsharks @AdOceanside Who we playing and where?
@PattyMurray I get that in some instances it’s to save the life of the mother. Those represent less than 1% of all abortions. Your followers and Constituents are more intelligent than you give them credit for. Stop selling the 99% as the 1%.

@PattyMurray Opened the door? See also the majority of Natl Emergencies over the past 40 years declared by Dem presidents. Pres. Obama declared 7 US Emergencies... get this.. in Africa!!

@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris And I could care less about monuments. In many ways they appear as Idols for worshipping. Many people have done great deeds and their legacy is how they changed the world. Legacy doesn’t crumble like concrete.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris Stay on point here. It’s ok for her to cite the good deeds of someone who refused to sign an anti-lynching bill; something she just pushed for.
😂😂😂😂🤡 https://t.co/gQ5QDKHt9C
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump So if the Pres doesn’t fire him, why does that say about the Pres? Unless Rod is rolling and squealing on others.
@SenGillibrand That’s not all that helpful. How about completely free education for all orphans, and all students who fall below a certain income level and zero interest loans for student borrowers?
@SenGillibrand 🙌🙌🙌
@KamalaHarris Odd choice of hero: 1935 refused to support the federal anti-lynching legislation of the Costigan-Wagner bill. In 1937 FDR appointed Hugo Black, from AL and known member of the KKK to the U.S. Sup Ct. Black went on to validate FDR’s decision to incarcerate Japanese Americans.
@KamalaHarris Was it right to declare 6 national emergencies andnuae the funds in foreign lands?

@ShoelessDick @JWwaazzzzuupp21 @KamalaHarris So the number of Reps is based on population not citizenship?
@ewarren So what happened was 2 things: inflation and the wages got stagnant in the 1970s. So if you manipulate only one of those (wages), inflation will take off due to supply and demand of products, and pricing strategies. She has  no clue about simple economics but wants to be Pres!
@ByronYork What a clown
@JWwaazzzzuupp21 @ShoelessDick @KamalaHarris If there is not a citizenship question, how do you know if Bob, Jane, Marlon etc are to be counted as for determination of US House of Representatives? The number is representatives is based on population of citizens.

@SCforEd 5. I brought several state legislators (Sen and House) as well as a US Rep into our school, which is amazing. All admitted (this sure is different than back in my day). DUHHH! That’s why folks who are in the schools need to work on the real reform. #SCTeachersWalkOut to fix it.
@SCforEd those schools where there is one county school. What’s the plan for getting those kids to a different county? Is there one? Transportation? Ok to put kids on a bus for hours to cross county lines?
@SCforEd 2. Educators need to organize and walkout and demand it be fixed NOW. Boosts in salaries are great, really deserved, but curriculum reform is also needed, and more money for technology and supplies.	3. Failing schools need to be really addressed not rezoned/reshuffled.	Especially
@SCforEd 1. That won’t do it but sure. Educators need to take a stand and mean it. Why is it that Educators weren’t picked to sit in the Cmte? @Paul_Bowers got them on the ropes, but “we” are letting them get back up. Hence all the delays and empty promises.

@JCI_JohnEvans @BreakinDownFilm Pride is a terrible thing; it deludes one from logic. ~ Me
“Broke is such a harsh word. I prefer ill-liquid.” 😳
@Cowboyz_1993 @BreakinDownFilm @JCI_JohnEvans Wasn’t saying Kap had done any bad deeds. Saying that dudes with bad deeds have been picked up.
@BreakinDownFilm @JCI_JohnEvans That was my point. Instead he is demanding an NFL team pick him up and sign him. He hasn’t played in years. Ray Rice says hello. Many teams have picked up guys with bad deeds in their past because they can still play.
@JCI_JohnEvans @BreakinDownFilm So you think all owners are colluding to keep him out? He was in the most liberal city in the country and they let him go.
@Tara44996716 @AOC https://t.co/Cm9zxjtE75
@JCI_JohnEvans @BreakinDownFilm If he wanted to play, showcase his talent and work his way back into the league, he could have done that. He’s playing spoiled kid, now.
@AOC Labor bankrolled your campaign. Let’s be honest.
@RepCunningham Obama care passed the same way. Let’s not be hypocritical, please
@Lisaiz2 @jimmarking @RepCunningham Doesn’t understand how Gov works. A simple majority didn’t mean you get the votes. When one side isn’t being obstructionists how do you accomplish anything?
@bgaolach @JenniferDebnam @PattyMurray Then you’d know having a majority but a few doesn’t give you control.
@Bakari_Sellers Bush and Obama said it was an emergency.  Come in Bakari, you know how Gov works, “control” is not having a majority, Adelina needed at least 10 votes from Dems.

@JCI_JohnEvans @PattyMurray No. Divided country on this issue. To say the people don’t want it, is untrue. Some don’t but some do. Some care who pays for it, some don’t. Her own state is divided and didn’t go all blue in 2016
@SenSchumer @senatemajldr What your proposals to get China and India to stop using fossil fuels?
@JCI_JohnEvans @PattyMurray That’s a great point. 30 states said yes, 20 no. So which people is she referring to? Only one side?
@PattyMurray Which people? The 62,984,828 that voted for him?
@JCI_JohnEvans @SenKamalaHarris @SpeakerPelosi 🤷‍♂️ let’s find out
@SenKamalaHarris Who will be the first to meet with Angel moms, you or @SpeakerPelosi? Guessing neither
@JohnnyD95yj @RealJamesWoods 😂
@PattyMurray How’d that work out for ya, there? Ask a staffer (since you are incapable) to write a useful legislation you know like something aimed at curtailing drugs, fighting addiction, boosting education and commerce, things to build up communities.
@jmice365 @MaryAnn_S_8881 @finefoodlover @SenKamalaHarris That’s true. Take Smollett out as his case has some issues. He may have been a victim. But seems like the investigation is turning towards him.
@cinammonappie @SenKamalaHarris If that actually worked we’d have fewer criminals. Sure it works for a few. Why not focus her time and attention to the “why” - why do criminals do what they do? Is because of poverty, greed, want, survival.. etc. Attack the root of the problem, not the result of it.
@cinammonappie @SenKamalaHarris People have a choice. Do you want a Government that makes all your choices for you?
@KimpsonForSC *look

@SenKamalaHarris Instead of asking this or that, draft sweeping legislation that solves the immigration crisis and use it in your campaign. Win win
@SenKamalaHarris Just create a law that says criminals can’t own or use guns. Problem solved, right?

@StefanMolyneux Research and think on my own.
@ChrisMurphyCT Says the guy who posted an article claiming misdeeds by the sitting President in 2014 and labeling it done by the current Pres who was elected in 2016.
@KamalaHarris She’s selling a refund as some magic windfall of cash given to folks by the Govt instead of calling it what it is ... THEIR money loaned to the US Govt interest free.
@SpeakerPelosi Thank you!

@harrisonjaime @LindseyGrahamSC If a politician isn’t educating their potential or current constituents on deductions and impacts on refunds and what a refund truly is,	you are doing them a huge disservice.

@GSwarthout @AOC So is Ellisons accuser credible? Why hasn’t akwuone heard that the MN AG (allegedly) beat a woman in the face. She posted bruises
@NYPDnews @NYPDDetectives American citizen or no?
@johncardillo Wouldn’t federal authority preempt the Mayor?
Really scary when folks are filming MS13 murdering someone. 90 is in your NY district @AOC correct? https://t.co/fFWvBfbMSF
@PattyMurray @usedgov What’s your stance on Venezuela ?
@KamalaHarris What’s KH’s stance on Venezuela? Russia told us to back out, we said no.
@AOC That lady is holding a stop Kavanaugh poster.. the accusers said they made it up. Keith Ellison’s accuser hasn’t said she made it up. Where are the calls for him to resign? Seems hypocritical
@thehill NPR interview will do damage to his campaign
@Rep_Pendarvis Resign or no? Also troubling the accusations about the Lt Gov. The Sup Ct confirmation hearings taught us to believe the accused no matter what.
@RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi He is. He opened Gov back up and gave you three weeks to do your job. Odd that you’re still blaming him because you aren’t doing your job. You get paid $3,350 per week to do your job therefore in 3 weeks time, taxpayers paid you $10,000 to do nothing.
@ShadeSocrates @ChuckCallesto Not when 1 party and many of its followers are consistently making claims that the other side is racist, sexist, etc. hypocrisy is being exposed

@Jamie_Sampson @Balerstos @talkiestar @NewYorkGOP @AOC @MaxRose4NY @DelgadoforNY19 @ABrindisiNY Excellent point.
@talkiestar @Jamie_Sampson @NewYorkGOP @AOC @MaxRose4NY @DelgadoforNY19 @ABrindisiNY Your right, 6 states should control 44. I used to be against the EC; however, it is important to balance the power. Just because more folks live in CA, should the west coast control the SE? Would the west coast be ok being controlled by the SE? Likely not
@talkiestar @Jamie_Sampson @NewYorkGOP @AOC @MaxRose4NY @DelgadoforNY19 @ABrindisiNY The majority of folks in those states did
@TheCalebSurface @AveryGWilks @MaayanSchechter @santeecooper 😂
@Jamie_Sampson @NewYorkGOP @AOC @MaxRose4NY @DelgadoforNY19 @ABrindisiNY 30/50 states, no?
@AOC Millions of Americans do want it.	Nearly half of you trust polling maybe more than half is polling is as accurate as Nov 1 2016. So job is to stop pointing fingers, be a leader and make a compromise on all Immigration.

@SenGillibrand Yes!!
@chiproytx @DanCrenshawTX It’s 100 percent @HurdOnTheHill ‘a issue. Face it. He beat a Dem by approx 3K votes. Look at his district’s demographics. He clearly only wants re-election.
@lizzyscardinal @DejraShockley @PattyMurray @romanet_carol They don’t know how to. It’s only party whining
@theAnonymousCog @PattyMurray Don’t forget the Speaker also went to Hawaii during the shut down. Yet Murray tweets “Trumpshutdown” 20 times a day toeing Nancy’s line. How sad. Your state should get better representation. Very sad for your guys.
@azuredawn9 @cambabaroonie @PattyMurray 1. Stop being fake and toeing the party line. 2. Tell members in said party (House members in WA) to secure our border with whatever CBP says they need. They know better than anyone.
@WSeattlePete @PattyMurray Dude, Murray voted no to pay the Coast Guard during the shut down.
Defend what? This pic? It’s indefensible and disgusting. Thursday = post-birth abortion (murder), Friday= racist photo. He needs to resign ASAP. Pic here: https://t.co/DmxGrF1k1i
@JCI_JohnEvans @DonaldJTrumpJr 🤷‍♂️
@AOC @RoKhanna Ask @CoryBooker before you step on toes. He’s running for President now. 🤫
@PattyMurray Fact: You voted NO on the bill to pay Coast Guard. There was no wall, no border, nothing but pay the coast guard. The video coverage is available. So do you really care about service members or just following Nancy’s order? Fact check her vote if you don’t believe me.
@johncardillo https://t.co/ylYAKJiejY
@PattyMurray Agree with solving this problem and protecting people. How is this an epidemic but this isn’t? President is not the source for either charts https://t.co/HU0sXl3ue1
@DonaldJTrumpJr MOAB = finished product
@PattyMurray Will someone please just ask the good senator here a simple yes or no if she believes in open borders? $10 says it won’t be a yes or no answer. Also, would she rather send them to Afghanistan than Texas? Odd
@SenGillibrand @CoryBooker She is creepy. Run away Cory.
@PattyMurray Staffer misspelled “America’s Wall” again.
@JCI_JohnEvans Yes.
@PattyMurray You misspelled “America’s Wall”

@AMeisner32 @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer It’s also the reason why for the most part the electoral college numbers are based on population numbers.
@KentRos01867112 @RonaldCocks @SecNielsen @CBP @DHSgov True but so what? What are these guys’ hangups on protecting our country?
@awilkesmd @SecNielsen @CBP @DHSgov How much came through last night at other border crossings? Answer: no one knows. I’d rather keep people in the US safe by any and all means
@KentRos01867112 @LauraTripp57 @SecNielsen @CBP @DHSgov 🙌
@coach_naz @SecNielsen @CBP @DHSgov You’re a special kind of stupid. No crap. Walls are meant to keep people out and to force them to go through ports of entry so that they and their cars etc can be vetted.
@Diztract @SecNielsen @CBPArizona @CBP @DHSgov You think they catch them all? Protecting our country is not somewhere we need to save save save. We haven’t done enough in this area.
@AMeisner32 @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer So you’re arguing the states with low population shouldn’t matter? That’s why the house and senate were constructed - based on fairness of representation and population and to avoid a tyrant from 1 type of area controlling the masses
@moekolo_ @AOC Absolutely not. That’s the American Dream that one can move up. Saying this dude is unqualified - I mean who says what qualifies you except the Constitution?
@MNfrankie @alicia71181 @GrayCollegeiate Or semi 😂 can’t keep up with brackets in this state 😩
@MNfrankie @alicia71181 Defense wins championships. Love to see rematch in state final @GrayCollegeiate
@SouthernLady328 @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer No one is saying a piece of land should vote. The point is when you look at a map of voters, blue is in pockets of a few large cities. Should they control the country?
@AMeisner32 @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Wow. Sooo inclusive of you
@benshapiro Agree
@KamalaHarris Permanently lift them out? Why can’t you do some real work, think past 1 and look at 2 and 3. What if you drafted a policy to permanently lift them out. You now through education with life skills, real jobs. This keeps property owners rich and no one really gets out of poverty.
@AveryGWilks Where’s the video?
@SenGillibrand Courage to protect American citizens at all costs?
@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Gets even more complicated when non-citizens vote. The citizens can’t even agree.. seems like ALL of us agree we are duped by red and blue. They get rich off of our labor.
@ashleyawoww @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer I understand your argument. Should one city control an entire state? Should one state, i.e California control 10 states in the Southeast? Unfortunately it’s a reason our country is divided
@ashleyawoww @Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer He didn’t want to stand in line to get one.
@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer The blue areas should control the entire nation? https://t.co/RBvJMwYTZA
@SouthernLady328 @drobpix @Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Seems like my idea would resolve it all. I’m not a rah rah party person. I like ideas and policies that are fair, productive, and provide the common interest.
@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Yes but not all voting is a US wide election. Perhaps your DL could be your ID. What is wrong with requiring and ID if said ID was easily available and free. And why should approx 5-10 states control the US?
@Inked_Buddhist @JohnLockwoodIII @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer So it’s fair to registered voters to go out and cast their vote in a democratic election when their vote may compete against an opposition vote by someone who isn’t legally supposed to vote?
@sportsmommy74 @JCI_JohnEvans @panerabread John is free. He can deliver 😂
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker ? Have you studied his 2002 campaign? While a loss, his will and resolve while facing so much mudslinging, facing folks who were all about Sharpe, knowing they had no interest in him, was and is very inspiring for someone willing to challenge the system. Kamala as Pres is a joke
@JohnLockwoodIII @Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer You’re saying there is no fraud in voting? Guess those dead voters came back from the grave to vote and the young man in CA was wrongfully convicted for registering illegal voters. You seem up to speed on facts
@JohnLockwoodIII @Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer I want every citizen of the US to vote.  I also want voting rights restored individuals who served their time. I do think the Gov should pay for a state / voter ID card then require it to vote. That’s fair and leads to good accounting.
@Inked_Buddhist @CollarPresident @SouthernLady328 @TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Roughly 2,000 votes affected who became President in 2000. Saying even 1 vote doesn’t matter is disingenuous to the system.
@garlickn0ts @TuckerTonight @SenSchumer Well as you may know, evidence was entered in federal court that the last Mexican Pres received bribes from the cartel, so we have to take our own measures.
@SenSchumer @SenatorMenendez @SenBooker @maziehirono @realDonaldTrump So you don’t want an accurate count of American citizens? Isn’t that the purpose of the census?
@sportsmommy74 Congrats B! Will be fun to watch him compete on the biggest stage
@RepMattGaetz Can we get a roll call of who was present / absent or no?
@KimpsonForSC Awesome news!
@tedcruz Can anyone explain to me how, after the child is born, that the mothers health is affected? (Besides lack of sleep :-)) this is murder
@flrbase @AOC He grew up poor. He made a coffee house a global player in trade and green policies, employs thousands.. No she doesn’t want him in. She preaches fairness but is a hypocrite. Just like voting down that bill that would block Cong. from getting pay raises for sex offenses.
@tictoc @AOC I guess you think giving Legislators a pay raise even though they have sexual improprieties against them is ok. Your base know you feel that way, considering most of these incidences are men on women. Dems rejected Rep bill that would disallow raises for sex offenses
@MarshaBlackburn Would be amazing if US citizens could see the actual budget before congress votes on it. I have a feeling millions of tax payers would take issue with the billions leaving our country while we have so many veterans, children and families starving, homeless, lacking education etc
@KamalaHarris The Rep led senate Unanimously passed the federal anti-lynching bill in Dec. due to Corey’s hard work. I hope he runs for Pres. I can’t tolerate your ignorance and uninformed rhetoric much longer. @CoryBooker please save us from her. You didn’t sleep your way into office.
@KamalaHarris 2014 called and wants its crisis back. So on the the East Coast (that area East of West VA, we are free from the epidemic? You need new research folks. The more states leading the nation in opioid deaths are north and east of West VA.
@flrbase @AOC Exactly. It’s doesn’t matter what you did. But she preaches inclusion, tolerance, equality, and fairness yet told this gentlemen he wasn’t worthy of something and one could interpret it to mean she, as an elected official was a higher class of people. That’s not cool
@AOC You were a bartender who only worked as an aide in politics. Amazing someone who preaches fairness and inclusion, effectively told a billionaire to “sit boy” according to you he isn’t worthy or experienced enough like you. Good ole boy much?

@RealSaavedra No tag? @AOC I don’t agree with her,  but if you’re going to say something about her at least let her defend herself.

Please, just like the big banks... some folks are perceived as “too big to fail.” Trump challenged the establishment and some will pay because of it.
@MLeeBaxter1 @56tbirdJones @steph93065 @SpeakerPelosi Perhaps Manifort directed him. They are former partners in the lobbying firm
@Joannapanic Have you read the indictment? Also it says nothing or charges nothing about Russia.
@Paul_Bowers Someone needs to read Citizens United. What’s the backstory on the records?
@thecjpearson Took 8 from the other side and our side fighting better
@MichaelBorderss @steph93065 @SpeakerPelosi Ok then you are herby charged with being a fraud. Not by any Uas Atty in any Indictment, but by word of mouth you are a fraud and have been charged with fraud because I say so. #LiberalLogic #EmotionsareLogic
@PattyMurray I hope her constituents are happy. The only tweets were stories and not a single tweet about trying to work on a deal. Blame and dip. Also the great state of WA has many @USCG members. You voted NO on a clean bill only directed to pay them. Your Nay is on record.

@Imustbecrazy5 @meghanomical @DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris In part that’s why I partially support the slogan shared by Reagan, Clinton, and Trump to make it great again.

@Tyler11711 @Rm4djr @slimvp0821 @Bakari_Sellers @KamalaHarris I found a new Twitter best friend.	This dude is intelligent. I like how you sift through the bull.. and make sound judgements based upon what you see and not what you are told to see 🤝👏👊
@Tyler11711 @tammyrpatterso1 @Rm4djr @slimvp0821 @Bakari_Sellers @KamalaHarris For real. What dude comments on her hair or something like that? Not the dudes I know. I don’t like her socialists views. That has nothing to do with sex, color, hair, nails, clothes, etc.
@SenGillibrand She’s also part of the problem. Please, anyone point me to 1 member of Congress who isn’t what she describes and/or bought and paid for by lobbyists.
@MountPleasantPD @alicia71181 we (both) need one :/)
@politico Great point, Joe.
@angela_rye Can someone please explain why the hat or why you feel it is symbolic for racism? I’m NOT disagreeing with you. Just want some input. Can we please have a civil discussion about it?
@SenGillibrand Both sides throwing tantrums. President wants his way and Nancy and Chuck mad Hillary lost.
@petermccoyforsc Any way you can get us a small amount of time with the Speaker to discuss the fully integrated STEM model?
Happy birthday to my dude! @chaynes2020. Young man is the real deal in the classroom and on and off the football and soccer fields. Blessed to coach such a great guy.
@JCI_JohnEvans @LynnBardon @RepCunningham So your theory is if you can’t stop all crime, why bother? Tell that to the trafficked people or rape victims who’s lives are destroyed.
@JCI_JohnEvans @LynnBardon @RepCunningham Some say no because they use the river to water cows, some say yes they do. Look for the video of the rancher who had the rape tree on his property. He wants the wall and better patrol.
@JCI_JohnEvans @LynnBardon @RepCunningham Haha with what we know now, Mexican President took $100M in bribes from El Chapo alone, athey cant and won’t pay for it. However I’d we confiscated 25% of remittances, Mex would be paying for it

@wfdgirlie @rplantejr @JoeCunninghamSC Yes but he promised not to toe the party line (LoCo over party), not to vote for Nancy and fight offshore drilling. 2/3 so far. And for others the only folks opposing it are SLED and Atty Gen. The law is passing and nothing they can do about it.
@CigarDaisy311 @GQCOP45 @JoeCunninghamSC @SCGOP You do know a ton of Repub Reps and Senate votes for it. It was drafted by Republicans. Geeze man
@davidhogg111 Democracy is sticky notes? Just making sure I understand you correctly - you know we live in a Republic and not a democracy, correct?
@JCI_JohnEvans @scdp Been called a crisis for many years. Funds were granted on last spending bill, contracts awarded. New spending bill was asked for. Dems said no. Said it’s a crisis why won’t you, blah blah blah

@JCI_JohnEvans @mkraju My thoughts - “you’re price is way too high; you got to cut it” Its a waste; reality is we do what we want anyway. 2nd reality, it’s basically our money, UK’s and Australia- a coalition of 3 forced because everyone else is broke.

@cholata329 @BartSantello @PatriotRLR @BarbaraRauch6 @SecNielsen @POTUS Totally agree! We should be open to any and all who want to come. Just do it the right way. And become a true part of our country - not in hiding.
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham Just as there are congressional members on the borders of Tex, NM and Arizona who do want it. As well as many border patrol agents. That’s part of the problem, some do. So who wins in the debate?
@BartSantello @cholata329 @PatriotRLR @BarbaraRauch6 @SecNielsen @POTUS I don’t agree with separation of kids from their family. Unfortunately in the world we live in today, many groups of people do not have documentation therefore it is had to prove whose kids belong to who. Many human traffickers exist and quite often it takes time to prove.
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham ? Odd post is odd.
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham Racist - that’s odd. Against who? You obviously don’t know me. I have heard many many officials say they supported it. I asked what officials would it take for you the hear or believe they want it. A wall is in-American, how?
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 What officials said this? Do you agree that local residents, members of Congress in that area, local news sources and Border Agents to be officials on the subject? Is Pelosi an official on this subject?
😂 https://t.co/UWRRqKzYLT
@reinventjulie @kmadams88 @RepCunningham Your last sentence is incorrect. In fact, the President, Sec of Homeland Security, and many many many agents and officials and landowners on the border support it. Just 2 years ago, Chuck wanted it, Clinton, and Obama did, too. Why do you hate America?

@Mateo_Clough @RKnight36 @Bakari_Sellers Yes sir. That’s what I am asking for examples to hurt or harm any American. I have mixed kids and white kids. I try to have educated conversations with them and let them choose their feelings. This one has been tearing me up. The only specific example anyone has told me was cops.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Knight, you are one smart dude! We may have graduated around the same time. My son is interested in your area of science plus robotics.
@Mateo_Clough @RKnight36 @Bakari_Sellers That’s what I was trying to see or hear - what he did / said to inflame racial tensions.  1 guy told me it’s him siding with the police. What areas or gifts or economic policies has he tried to please Putin? Selling 20 % of US’s Uranium mining rights to them ticks me off.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Ok, thank you for your time. I was just tying to figure out why he did or said that makes you feel he is openly racist. Homophobic, xeno, and miso. Have a good night
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Not what I was intending. I am more interested in why people feel a certain way about Trump.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers his policies specifically 3 of them really really hurt families and people of color. I was a huge fan. He also gave a speech saying he wanted to Make America Great Again. Saw that one today.
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers My questions are this: what exec orders, policies, laws proposed to Congress or actions by the Pres has made you feel he is racist or seeks to remove any rights or harm any US Citizen of any color? I was a huge B Clinton fan and the more I dug into it I found
@RKnight36 @Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers Respect and thank you to both for taking the time to reply. It’s really on me to figure out why people feel a certain way. We all different and we have different feelings and interpretations of what we see and hear. You guys mind helping me out?
@Steve_Siegel @RepMikeLevin This!

@Mateo_Clough @Bakari_Sellers That’s not true. That guy is disgusting, and does not in any way represent my feelings or attitudes. That’s not fair to say everyone is like that.
@ChuckCallesto Amazing many years ago she tried to stand up to covert drug running in the US. I watched her question witness and demand answers. Seems like she walked away from that MW and became the swamp.
@KamalaHarris Just because you don’t directly receive PAC money doesn’t mean it won’t be used under your direction, the party’s direction or forbyiur benefit. Disavow all of it and stand against it.
@KamalaHarris All great things. Run in that. Nothing but that. Leave all the other stuff alone.
@JCI_JohnEvans @RepCunningham So only states on the southern border are affected? The numbers released on spending per state are pretty staggering. ~$600M for SC. Instead of taxing cigarettes (dying product) there’s money for teachers right there

@BrittLundgren @RepMarkMeadows Did someone at CNN teach you the use of “white - nationalist” and that’s if someone loves their country and all of its citizens and wants to see his country and countrymen succeed at everything, is a racists? We’re not Germany circa 1930. #AmericaFirst #AllAmericans

@LindseyGrahamSC I say get to the bottom of it and clean house with firings/indictments if necessary. Also do the same if any exists in the GOP. Root out all corruption. The people have such low levels of faith in our Gov. perhaps if we rebuilt that, more could be accomplished

@DawnSenate47 @gabriel_acman @KamalaHarris 🤯many many states do have harsh regulations. So you’re saying if we make legal gun owners and law abiding citizens pay more and jump through more hoops, bad guys who steal and illegally obtain them will just surrender theirs and stop using them and go through legal process? 😂

NH demo is 93.9 W / 1.1 AA vs. DC 45.1 W / 47.1 AA. Based on the #s then her theory is DC doctors racist not NH. Need more states data

@RobertS71494497 @JCI_JohnEvans @PattyMurray That’s true to - this isn’t the years post 9/11 where both sides choose an outside “enemy” and actually work together. Now closely held ideals and an unwillingness to bargain is the enemy of progress
@Brironic Dude she just said publicly if she is morally right that is better than being factually right.
@no1listened @KamalaHarris Thanks for sharing. It was informative; however, it doesn’t seem to point the finger Kamala seems to depict - racist doctors provide better healthcare to W moms. This article seems to say decisions related to unplanned pregnancies, prenatal care and post natal (oddly) affect this
@JCI_JohnEvans If they have been convicted, by law they are guilty
@JCI_JohnEvans @RobertS71494497 @PattyMurray It should be required ...
@D_Rial_7M1 @thelastpinkcar @PattyMurray I’m not stressed due to anything the President has done. Speak for your self.
@JoeMomma833 @HopeForFuture2 @PattyMurray Please dear God take a civics class. They controlled a majority but not enough. Your statement makes the claim the Republicans could smack the gavel and that’s it. No, they needed 8 votes in the Senate and no matter what - if even giving away $- Dems weren’t allowing Trump to win
@JeffHJR87 @thelastpinkcar @Angie04955927 @Bdiggity66 @MerrittKelly1 @PattyMurray Dude your are talking facts and reason and trying to argue with emotion. Tears outweigh facts. We should try a mass cry for our border and anyone who says differently about our feelings is racist/angry/bully etc
@thelastpinkcar @Bdiggity66 @MerrittKelly1 @PattyMurray Bless your CNN heart. Do you understand economics? Do you disagree with any of these facts? 1. The Market is higher vauled than it has ever been. 2. Unemployment is at nearly 50 year lows. 3. Unemp for minorities is at a nearly all-time record low. 4. Trade deals are more fair.
@Brironic @HopeForFuture2 @PattyMurray L.o.l. You’re relying on “AOC” reporting on Senate issues.
@JCI_JohnEvans @RobertS71494497 @PattyMurray My understanding is they needed 8 Dem votes. They knew they were not getting, so they didn’t waste their time. People that say one party controlled everything need to take a civics class.
@JenBerryHawes @SC_ELS @postandcourier @glennsmith5 By the way.. huge fan! You guys have done what I’ve been trying to do for years. Make the Legislature listen and act. Bravo Jen! Huge fan!
@JenBerryHawes @SC_ELS @postandcourier @glennsmith5 We have to pay teachers more to retain and recruit great ones. But we have to reform the curriculum to one that engages the student, makes content relevant, and inspires them. STEM has been working in a few schools in SC. Fully integrated STEM, not BS babysitting Afterschool

@NYGovCuomo Is Assange included in this? Better run that by Hillary just in case.
@SenGillibrand Maybe. Are you interested in the wall and actually enforcing fair immigration laws, bringing as many labor jobs back to America and furthering progress in reworking trade deals? Education is controlled by the states, so what’s your plan there? If so, I’m in!
@KamalaHarris I didn’t even know that was still a thing in the US. What are the actual numbers - not statistics? How many women are dying? Is there a correlation or something in common? Ex: age ranges,  number of births? Geography? Or it is just race?
@PattyMurray It’s like I have to tell you HOW to be a Senator. I mean seriously what do you do to deserve $174,000 a year? Step one, get your butt to the office and figure out how the hell you can help her and many more by getting those prices lower. That’s making a lasting difference.

@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris that should never be taken away based on socio-economic status. We can’t strip rights based on geography, Wealth etc. Efforts should be concentrated as the root cause.
@JCI_JohnEvans @KamalaHarris So poverty leads to gun crime? If guns aren’t necessarily a “problem” in other areas, shouldn’t poverty be the target of concern? We shouldn’t take rights from folks who are in poverty (ie gun ownership) if they’ve done nothing wrong. That’s akin to voting rights

@lishamae777 @DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris Exactly. The second Amendment was specially so that the people could defend themselves and their property from criminals, foreign invaders AND and tyrant in their own Government
@DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris Great discussion! Here’s the point, the lady who started it is a troller. So we do our best to hash out issues civilly. She doesn’t care about AAs in this country who suffer gun crime, poor schools, no healthcare, hungry, poor etc. She cares more about other nations’ citizens.
@PattyMurray You’re equally to blame. The legislative and executive branches getting paid for this is ridiculous. Oh wait, executive doesn’t get paid under this guy.
@DawnSenate47 @KamalaHarris I can see your point. Cigarettes kill around 280,000 a year. Ban those? (Please), DUI kills 11,000 per year, ban cars or booze? 19,000 died from prescription pain killers, ban those? At some point people need to be accountable - not the product
@rhauth @DawnSenate47 @GermanSwede @KamalaHarris 2. I do believe the Court should step in and remove weapons form someone deemed mentally unstable (threat to themselves or others) 3. No citizen needs a personal armory, 4. Background checks need to be better. 5. Penalties stiffer for those caught with them illegally
@rhauth @DawnSenate47 @GermanSwede @KamalaHarris I don’t understand it either and I’m pro-2nd. I live in the south and own and love them. I use them for hunting, home protection and personal protection from snakes and spiders. 1. I don’t believe anyone needs an auto/matic, assault rifle, or be allowed to own bump stocks 2.
@KimpsonForSC @JoeCunninghamSC I really don’t see why some on the other side of the aisle are making a big deal of this. Sure is was a simple mistake, but folks need to lighten up. Maybe then we could reach some common grounds.
@danielfrost @KamalaHarris So take guns from law abiding citizens and “hope” the bad guys follow the law? That’s makes a lot of sense. Thanks for clearing it up for us.
@KamalaHarris Guns are basically banned in Chicago yet its one of the highest gun murder rates in the US. Don’t see you advocating there. If guns are banned what gives?

@someperson426 @thecorrect_take @Incogni85044148 @StefanMolyneux Cut from where? We have massive amounts of folks who serve us and are underpaid. I wish folks could keep more of their money, but for those who think college should be free don’t understand someone pays for it.
@MNfrankie Don’t tweet and drive 😂😂😂
@someperson426 @thecorrect_take @Incogni85044148 @StefanMolyneux 3. Our teachers are grossly underpaid. Our military is grossly underpaid. Our veterans are not cared for as they should be. Before we send 1 penny outside our border we need to step up and help all these folks first.
@someperson426 @thecorrect_take @Incogni85044148 @StefanMolyneux 2. My only beef with our country right now is that we have millions of folks, especially and most importantly children who go to failing schools, are homeless, hungry and have no healthcare. That’s why I want the US to focus on us first to help our people so we can help others.
@someperson426 @thecorrect_take @Incogni85044148 @StefanMolyneux 1. I bet  your “in-group” all look like you/ the same. Branch out brother. Folks who don’t look like you are pretty awesome, too.

@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Why can’t we let the people vote on “the wall” or to approve the budget? You can’t say the people voted on it in the last election. That’s not true. On the flip side you could say the people voted for it in 2016. Vote: Border wall - yes or no a with all true and real facts.
@CoachGradyBrown I got word you landed in a great spot! Happy for you brother!
@SecNielsen why don’t you have a National press conference where you share your data but also your sources and let the American people hear what you have to say and come to our own conclusions. That seems fair.

@thecorrect_take @Incogni85044148 @StefanMolyneux It is a big deal. I wonder why there so that gap. Part of the study by the folks at Berkeley suggested there was a difference in the average actual size of our brains. Is this the reason? Is that even true? Either way, we need to find a way to close the gap!
@JCI_JohnEvans @notcolloquial @StefanMolyneux No. Could some employer / fellow employee have had that in their mind? Sure anything is possible. Most were concerned with winning/success. The color everyone loves is always green.
@StefanMolyneux A lot of racist folks in this thread. Not good folks. You need to move your neighbor for WHO they are, not what they are. Btw, the Rushton study indicated a 15-18 point diffence between W and B folks. Which was nearly the same as it was in World War 1.

@KamalaHarris Sending 12B outside the country will not end the shut down. A wall is immoral but the $12B supports abortion and human trafficking. Seems like you guys are on both sides of the morality fence.

@petermccoyforsc Then repeal 388, pay teachers what they are REALLY worth, and use the models (already developed IN HAND) to have a technology (STEM) real-world curriculum. NOT “Stem-in-box” but a fully integrated STEAM model. Do that and you’re Governor.
@petermccoyforsc @SCPressAssoc I am curious as to what the Legislative members consider reform to look like. My guess is it’s the same ole same ole.. an outdated curriculum and more money for school buses. Real reform is funding made as a priority and a curriculum based on the needs of Tomorrow’s economy.

@kindness_is @postandcourier @henrymcmaster @MPowersNorrell @JamesSmithSC True. At least James was interested in reforming education. We talked early on about our model that we developed that led to the No.1 STeM school in the nation! Just wish he had not blown off the scheduled meetings and had shown the model and gotten behind it.
@JCI_JohnEvans @grandpoobah13 @domifrancon @PattyMurray That’s debatable. Yes unfrozen assets, but more was given then captured. Besides why should we have given it? They haven’t held up their end of the deal.

@domifrancon @PattyMurray @FoxNews And are often exploited for that labor at below living wages. That’s not fair to them or American workers. And then $24 billion dollars goes back across the border in remittances that are untaxed.. If you want to know why the problem exists follow the money.
@domifrancon @PattyMurray @FoxNews “A study from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine analyzed the fiscal impact of immigration under different scenarios. Under some assumptions, the fiscal burden was $279 billion, but $43 billion in other scenarios.” Either way.. $5B is cheaper
@domifrancon @PattyMurray @FoxNews The $180B I speak of is for illegals. And yes there are millions of US citizens that need that help and should have first rights to it. I begin to wonder if both sides “enjoy” the use of illegals for exploitation of labor. That in itself is wrong - using people.

@PattyMurray You do the right thing and secure the border. What costs the American tax payers more: $5B for wall or $180B spent annually on folks who break the law?
@KamalaHarris So spending 180 billion of our tax dollars on folks who break the law is ok?

@petermccoyforsc @leonstav Mr. McCoy, That’s great! Now if we can get the state Govt to support it. If you have time, come on over to MtP and let me show you around Laing. A school in your district has already reached out wanting the model.
@petermccoyforsc @leonstav *funding
@petermccoyforsc @leonstav The only finding we are seeking is the equipment and supplies do that we can take the model and apply it at 3 failing schools to show with the right amount of technology, hands on, and relevant content you can break the failure cycles. But S.C. Gov is 🤷‍♂️
@petermccoyforsc @leonstav Thank you! We have the models, have done the research, collaborated and been blessed by the Deans of Education at USC, Clemson, and The Citadel. USC is working on a new rubric to test the outcomes of our children under the Fully Integrated STEM models.
@leonstav @petermccoyforsc Yes but you have to change the system not just throw money at it. We have been working with both the House and Senate Ed Cmtes on completely overhauling the system. Response: “Preaching to the choir.”
