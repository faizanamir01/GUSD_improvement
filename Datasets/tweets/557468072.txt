@LiberalAus If Victorian police can persue someone like George Pell for years on such flimsy or soma would say zero evidence, not even a date for the offence. Then what happened to this complaint? https://t.co/cFQzxK6KMH
If Victorian police spent how many years building a case based on such flimsy evidence against George Pell. Logic compells us to ask why they were so ready to bully this woman who complained she was RAPED BY BILL SHORTEN. She actually had a date &amp; place. https://t.co/cFQzxK6KMH

No longer a victim of a mother's murderous intent, it has nothing to do with her health care. It is a patient in its own right &amp; deserves protection of its own doctor
@maziehirono @eatkinson48 Once a baby has escaped a mothers murderous intentions, is outside the womb, it is no longer part of her body, or health. Alive outside a mothers body, a baby is a separate independent human life. A doctor has a duty of care to protect &amp; save that life without regard to a mother.
