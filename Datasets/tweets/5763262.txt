She was just arrested again, the victim of online mobs ginned up by the government btw. If she can take it under true threat, I think we can take it from tweets calling us boneheaded: https://t.co/10bccKzANU
If you want to see the impact of real dangerous digital Jacobins, you might take a lesson from journalists actually under siege like @mariaressa, who is dignified and strong under immense danger. She has cause to whine, but does everything BUT that: https://t.co/wTJAXS4gF5
This is coming from someone who did a boneheaded tweet recently and got slammed relentlessly by some in the Twitterverse. I somehow managed to take it — some fair criticism, some not — without aggrieved whining about it since I am loudly in arena too. https://t.co/N426ffEPFk

@jack My kid is hungry and says that you should do a real interview with me even if I am mean. Just saying. #karajack
@jack Make a glass house for events and people can watch and not throw stones. Pro tip: Twitter convos are wack. #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC Speaking of that (CONVERSATION), let's do one with sounds soon, like this #KaraJack #likebutter https://t.co/GJyHDWWKxY
LAST Q: For the love of God, please do Recode Decode podcast with me soon, because analog talking seems to be a better way of asking questions and giving answers. I think Twitter agrees and this has shown how hard this thread is to do. That said, thx for trying. Really. #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC By what? What is the #1 thing that distracted you and others and made this obvious mess via social media? #KaraJack
@jack Why are you still saying you’re the CEO of two publicly traded companies? What’s the point in insisting you can do two jobs that both require maximum effort at the same time? #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC Also are you ever going to hire someone to effectively be your number 2? #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC Ok, last ones are about you and we need to go long because your system here it confusing says the people of Twitter: 		1. What has been Twitter’s biggest missed opportunity since you came back as CEO? 		#karajack
@jack @elonmusk @AOC She is well beyond mastering it. She speaks fluent Twitter. #KaraJack
@jack Clip clop! #KaraJack
@jack @elonmusk What about @AOC #KaraJack
@jack And what about making Twitter a public trust?
@jack Chop chop on the other answers! I have more questions! If you want to use this method, quicker! #karajack
@shellen Yes.
@jack Ok, then WHO is the most exciting influential on Twitter right now? BE SPECIFIC #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump I still am dying for specifics here. #KaraJack https://t.co/Z8j8oGYeHg
@jack @realDonaldTrump Also: How close were you to selling Twitter in 2016? What happened? 		What about giving the company to a public trust per your NYT discussion.		#KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump also: Is twitter still considering a subscription service? Like “Twitter Premium” or something? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump going to shift to biz questions since it is not a lot of time and this system is CHAOTIC (as I thought it would be): What about the move to DAU instead of MAU. Why the move? And how are we to interpret the much smaller numbers? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump it would be really great to get specific examples as a lot of what you are doing appears incomprehensible to many. #karajack
@ccantu941 yes
@jack @realDonaldTrump Can you give a more detailed example of that that worked? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump Not one name? Ok, but it is a copout imho. I have a long list. #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump What confidence should we have that Russia or other state-sponsored actors won’t be able to wreak havoc on next year’s elections? #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump Ok new question (answer the newsworthy historical figure you MIGHT ban pls):  Single biggest improvement at Twitter since 2016 that signals you’re ready for the 2020 elections? #KaraJack
@jack @realDonaldTrump That seems questionable to a lot of people. Let me try it a different way: What historic newsworthy figure would you ban? Is someone bad enough to ban. Be specific. A name. #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump And will Twitter’s business/engagement suffer when @realDonaldTrump is no longer President? #karajack
@jack @realDonaldTrump Have you ever considered suspending Donald Trump? His tweets are somewhat protected because he’s a public figure, but would he have been suspended in the past if he were a “regular” user? #karajack
@jack Speaking of outrage, see my @realDonaldTrump question #karajack
@jack But you invented it. You can control it. Slowness is not really a good excuse. #karajack
Ok trying AGAIN @jack in another new thread! This one about @realDonaldTrump #KaraJack: 		We know a lot more about what Donald Trump thinks because of Twitter, and we all have mixed feelings about that.
@jack But why do they feel that way? You made it. #KaraJack
Hey @jack please reply to the new thread! Are you off eating bad meat with @finkd? #KaraJack
@jack In that vein, how does it affect YOU? #KaraJack
Ok, new one @jack #KaraJack		What do you think about twitter breaks and purges. Why do you think that is? I can’t say I’ve heard many people say they feel “good” after not being on twitter for a while:		https://t.co/RbucMeOSkE
@jack @finkd @waltmossberg Yeah, it's Chinatown, Jake. #KaraJack
@jack @finkd I am going to start a NEW thread to make it easy for people to follow (@waltmossberg just texted me that it is a "chaotic hellpit"). Stay in that one. OK? #KaraJack
@jack @finkd No, he is busy fixing Facebook. NOT! (he makes you look good) #karajack
@jack @finkd I wanted to get off thread with Mark added! Like he needs more of me. #KaraJack
@jack @finkd https://t.co/l6hAVMtrtB
@jack @finkd thx. I meant even more specifics on 4. But see the Twitter purge one. #KaraJack
@DevonHeinen Not my choice! Peace out!
@jack Ok, I am moving on to a related area: What do you think about twitter breaks and purges. Why do you think that is? I can’t say I’ve heard many people say they feel “good” after not being on twitter for a while. Such as this: https://t.co/RbucMeOSkE
@jack @finkd 1. WHICH? 	2. HOW?	3. OK, MUTE BUT THAT WAS A WHILE AGO	4. WHAT MORE?	I think people are dying for specifics. #karajack
@felixsalmon I love you #karajack
@jack Yes but i want THREE concrete examples.
@jack @finkd And so to end this topic, I will try again. Please give me three concrete things you have done to fix this. SPECIFIC. #karajack
@jack Got it. But do you think the fact that you all could not conceive of what it is to feel unsafe (women, POC, LGBTQ, other marginalized people) could be one of the issues? (new topic soon) #karajack
@jack @finkd I grade you all an F on this and that's being kind. I'm not trying to be a jackass, but it's been a very slow roll by all of you in tech to pay attention to this. Why do you think that is? I think it is because many of the people who made Twitter never ever felt unsafe. #karajack
@jack But why did you NOT see it? It seems pretty basic to run your platform with some semblance of paying mind to what people are doing on it? Can you give me some insight into why that was not done? #KaraJack
@jack So you do see the link between what you do and real life danger to people? Can you say that explicitly? I could not be @finkd to even address the fact that he made something that resulted in real tragedy. #KaraJack
@jack Why not just be more stringent on kicking off offenders? It seems like you tolerate a lot. If Twitter ran my house, my kids would be eating ramen, playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and wearing filthy socks #karajack
@jack So how do you stop THAT? I mean regular police forces cannot stop that. It seems your job is not to let it get that far in the first place. #KaraJack
@jack I am still confused. What the heck is "off-platform ramifications"? You are not going to have a police force, right? Are you 911? #karajack
@jack Well, WHERE does abuse happen most #karajack
@jack When you say physical safety, I am confused. What do you mean specifically? You are not a police force. In fact, social media companies have built cities without police, fire departments, garbage pickup or street signs. IMHO What do you think of that metaphor? #KaraJack
@jack Or maybe, tell me what you think the illness is you are treating? I think you cannot solve a disease without knowing that. Or did you create the virus? #karajack
@RichBTIG @jack ALL F
@jack Ok name three initiatives. #karajack
@jack Ok but I really want to drill down on HOW. How much downside are you willing to tolerate to balance the good that Twitter can provide? Be specific. #KaraJack
@jack please be specific. I see a lot of beard-stroking on this (no insult to your Lincoln jam, but it works). WHAT are you changing? SPECIFICALLY. #KaraJack
@jack Also my son gets a C in coding and that is NO tragedy. You getting one matters a lot. #karajack
@jack Well that is like telling me I am sick and am responsible for fixing it. YOU made the product, YOU run the platform. Saying it is a huge fail is a cop out to many. It is to me #karajack
@jack It seems twitter has been stuck in a stagnant phase of considering/thinking about the health of the conversation, which plays into safety, for about 18-24 months. How have you made actual progress? Can you point me to it SPECIFICALLY?
You know my jam these days is tech responsibility. What grade do you gave Silicon Valley? Yourself? #KaraJack
@jack Well an event product WOULD BE NICE. See my why aren't you moving faster trope.
Overall here is my mood and I think a lot of people when it comes to fixing what is broke about social media and tech: Why aren’t you moving faster? Why aren’t you moving faster? Why aren’t you moving faster? #KaraJack
@jack Great, let's go #KaraJack
To be clear with audience, there is not a new event product, a glass house, if you will, where people can see us but not comment. I will ask questions and then respond to @jack answers. So it could be CHAOS. #KaraJack
As @ashleyfeinberg wrote: “press him for a clear, unambiguous example of nearly anything, and Dorsey shuts down.” That is not unfair characterization IMHO. Third, I will thread in questions from audience, but to keep this non chaotic, let’s stay in one reply thread. #KaraJack
Oh hai @jack. Let’s set me set the table. First, I am uninterested in beard amulets or weird food Mark Zuckerberg served you (though WTF with both for my personal self). Second, I would appreciate really specific answers. #KaraJack

@theoaklandpanda @ArlanWasHere @heylizelle @m2jr Mike and I are going to do a podcast! We will put that on the list.
@ArlanWasHere @heylizelle @paulg How’s about we ignore and discuss it at SXSW? But so sorry and I am truly excited to interview you.
@ArlanWasHere @heylizelle Shocker. Papier-mâché is less delicate than the aggrieved sensibilities of pampered Silicon Valley VCs. They had become so used to being licked up and down all day that a simple criticism sends them into a faint so extreme that there aren’t enough smelling salts in the world.
@heylizelle @ArlanWasHere @paulg Oh this was about his all man VC list? I almost said something about it, but what’s the use? So I made breakfast with my two teen sons and we talked about the sitch in Virginia government and the ever toxic issues of sexism and racism. Seemed a better use of my time.
@applegreentech @heylizelle @ArlanWasHere @paulg Need to figure out the sitch. No joke, I was napping
@heylizelle @ArlanWasHere @paulg Is this Paul Graham? Because we have had some rounds with him at Recode about petty reactions etc.

3/3 ... “In brief, people with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character, a quality which, although approved in the abstract, sometimes loses ground to other, more instantly negotiable virtues.”
2/3 ... “If they choose to commit adultery, they do not then go running, in an access of bad conscience, to receive absolution from the wronged parties; nor do they complain unduly of the unfairness, the undeserved embarrassment, of being named co-respondent ...”
1/3 Here’s a quote I wish a lot more people in general and very much in particular would grok from Joan Didion in “Slouching Towards Bethlehem: “Like Jordan Baker, people with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things ....”

@The_Real_Snooze I am doing it for my kids
@taylor_jacob Ahahaaa. GILLETTE!
@itnor1 Because I overreacted.
@ybarselah No it is not clear. I should have waited and looked at all the videos and then tweeted. Maybe it would be the same. Maybe not. I certainly should not have compared them to Nazi. Anyone deserves that

@_TedG_ Well that yes
@afahy I agree. But not quite what I said either (like Nazis). It’s complicated and I should have waited.
@McClintockMarc Ah. I should have done more research. Still much video emerging and still unclear. I should look at it all
@ybarselah No. I said it was a complex situation. I should have waited before weighing in
@ethank Ah for my kids.
@John_W @ClaraJeffery Wow life is complex. Incredible
@twinkle_1990 You need to also look at other videos. My apology also does not mean that I want to listen to your dreck

@Fishy_Fischer Hey I never pretend I am not liberal nor do I cover politics. So step off
@jason_pontin Yeah. No one does
@ethank Yeah.
@ybarselah My apology does not mean that advice like yours is welcome
@TheBlueApe I saw the Tomahawk thing and the making fun of the old man. My response was still overdone
@BriannaWu @ClaraJeffery Hmm let me see if I can find a link. Still it is honestly murky
@ClaraJeffery Even if so (I get it) but I just don’t know. So I should have backed off.
Lastly, some called for me to apologize, so thanks except for those who also felt the need to also add that I look like Bruce Jenner (tho fair point). Others will not accept my apology, which is fine, so keep smacking as I can and should take it.
Just for the record, I still like the ad, even if my son thinks it is awful man-shaming. He’s wrong but he is right when he told me yesterday to “stop being mad on Twitter.” Also cursing: Bad.
I was a complete dolt to put up this and several other obnoxious tweets yesterday without waiting to see the whole video of the incident and I apologize to the kids from Kentucky unilaterally and also for using that clip to make another point about, of all things, a razor ad.

@JebKinnison @Reboticant I get it. I made a mistake. Will be apologizing on main tweet. Only took others down since they were obnoxious. The main one stayed since I was not trying to pretend I did not say it. Was not fleeing my mistake
@John95694724 Yes thx. But those are not my people.
@eugeneotool @nytimes I left main one up (in order not to pretend I did not jump the gun), but felt others should be removed because they were just obnoxious.
@Zimrico @BillKristol @pattonoswalt @Alyssa_Milano @CNN @MSNBC @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @maggieNYT @JoeNBC @chrislhayes @ananavarro I kept the original tweet up, so as not to look like I never said it.

@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Oh not getting into this as a lapsed catholic! Night!
@etlipman Hmm. That weird smirk and he was def too close. The kids near mocking the chanting and he never stopped the truly creepy glare. It just makes no sense. Why not try to engage? Or make the older man feel safe. The only person who truly acted peacefully was the old man.
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 My kid and I had a lively debate about it. He said it was man-shaming and my oldest loved it. ‘Merica
@etlipman @SamHarrisOrg @lessig @MichelleObama Yeah.
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Just twice so far. silly kids is what I thought (and ignored them as they were just being snarky, not very clever with the insults and were in no way scary, though it was not a lot of them).

@etlipman @sundarpichai @jack @POTUS @lessig @SamHarrisOrg Hmm still not a mistake
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 Yes also as a mother. Eek, what a task in today’s world. FYI, my 13 year old hated the Gillette commercial
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 I have been taunted by several (always young men and always clearly from out of town) for being a gay in a pretty gay area of dc. I was wearing a hoodie that said badass and queer on the back. Always with the hats.
@etlipman @idrankwhat3 @SamHarrisOrg I am a world class terrible meditator
@idrankwhat3 @etlipman Because it’s also clear (from what I can see) that these kids were not just joking. I would be horrified if my kids did anything but make that man feel safe. But fair point.
@etlipman Not sure harmless. That kid was not comforting that old man, he was scaring him even though he says now he did not intend it. And that old man was in no way menacing.
@etlipman @SamHarrisOrg @lessig Def but that was child’s play compared to what is coming
@etlipman @SamHarrisOrg @lessig Hmm not all tribes. What about that gang of marchers in Charlottesville? Methinks this would make a great column
@etlipman thx for your thoughtful tweets
@etlipman This is a very fair point. What will be worse is when the ability to alter these videos becomes flawless (close). There is a whole debate about this. It's an ugly world out there online and off.
@etlipman I am watching all the videos and I do not agree. You cannot tell what is going on easily and I suspect the kindest thing to say is that we will not ever know.

@m2jr Also I did not say it was a solution for these kids. But as the mother of two teen boys, you cannot imagine how hard we try to make them be their best in a world that makes it too easy to do your worst. Like those kids did.

3. While things change, my recollection of the rapport of the Bezos’ way back when was always that they were pretty steady and no drama people. With 4 kids, I would be shocked if there were contentiousness to warrant an impact on Amazon.
2. All Things D (which morphed to @Recode) wrote about the Google founder Sergey Brin’s divorce, which was much dicier since there were also work issues, and it eventually moved along. And Oracle’s Larry Ellison has had a few too.

@HotlineJosh Btw there was a broader set of issues at CBS. It was called Les Moonves and Charlie Rose.
@HotlineJosh It is in no way tsk-tsking by @AOC to point out that you have zero African American staffers. She is making a fair observation that it is a deficit for CBS. To then link her with Trump (who is essentially trying to criminalize the media) is also just odd way to defend yourself.
@theoldcfo Hey you never know
That’s not what @AOC said @HotlineJosh. Not clear why you can’t just admit she has a point that media needs more diverse staffing.

I’m disappointed in @AriFleischer. His defining act as washed-up DC toady is to criticize Senator-elect Romney.

@antoniogm Oh man. Now you lost me
@antoniogm Btw this is a GOOD debate
@antoniogm But these are decisions by essentially private firms as to the kinds of customers they want. Companies and people do this all the time
@antoniogm Yes obvi
@jaypinho @antoniogm They make the only rules that matter
@jaypinho @antoniogm What he said
@antoniogm I do not think others are not players. I think fb is the nexus player, hence greater responsibility
@antoniogm This is fair.
@antoniogm Hmm disagree here
@antoniogm Now you are parsing again. Is oxygen at fault for letting alex Jones breathe?
@antoniogm Well phew. Also makes the rules of engagement
@antoniogm More whataboutism that ignore very real worries about the centrality of fb to this equation
@antoniogm That is what unnerves me
@antoniogm See mark’s weak responses to me on that on podcast despite repeated and fair efforts to get him to comment.
@antoniogm I said that to you!
@antoniogm Also there have been so many instances of FB slow rolling on some practices that might give pause that they def have lost trust. It is tho something that can be won back (see uber)
@antoniogm Let’s ignore that one, but really and truly would love a reflection by you on why people are so unnerved with FB practices

@ForGoodnessAche @MTPDaily @facebook @MSNBC Yes but not even close to the same amplification
Great analysis by @KurtWagner8 https://t.co/HojaV6fQI7
@GetItDoneGuy Going to pass
@antoniogm Instead a lot of finger pointing at others rather than truly assessing what Facebook does that might make some queasy.
@antoniogm Also the fact that you almost never critically assess the behavior of Facebook, preferring to attack the media, says lots. Love to understand why you think many smart people have issues with the company
@hristo_vassilev @antoniogm And they have been written about a ton. Want all the links. The reason the focus is on Facebook is that it is the biggest consumer facing service
@antoniogm Also Antonio you all still do not get what is happening here by continually ignoring the issues people have with Facebook by parsing words. This report is not saying Facebook sells your data. It says it shares data without consent, it questions how Facebook handles data it has
@antoniogm Yeah those were the ones Facebook had deals with right?
