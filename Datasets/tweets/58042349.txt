@abbyfurchnervnl Who needs a Christmas Tree when you have an @abbyfurchnervnl
@abbyfurchnervnl Very cool! Now you you just need a tree topper for your head
@RobManchWDAY That 90 yard run was the longest ever against the Eagles.  With what Peterson has shown on the field this season, I hope they keep him for next season. Also they need to figure out why so many injuries!!!  Poor training?
@RobManchWDAY I think the Redskins play-off hopes are done.  You did not miss anything by not watching the game.
@sarahrudlang @EmilyOlsonTV Things are going to get out of control in the news room while you are in Iowa.
