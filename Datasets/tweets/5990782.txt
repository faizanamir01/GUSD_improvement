@AndrewCFollett @johnburnsnc Club for Growth isn’t putting a lot of scrutiny behind hiring “experts” — when they have to throw clean up tweets after a 2 second google search, but good on you for admitting you were wrong.		Now ... back to you crying wolf about the legal counting of votes in Florida.
@AndrewCFollett The final unofficial results from the state of Florida are not due until the Saturday afternoon AFTER the election.		I'll stop pretending that I didn't just google the state statutes if you'll stop pretending to be an expert from Florida. 		I’ll move this tweet if you missed it.
@AndrewCFollett An expert would know that the Jeb Bush appointee running the elections office in Broward Co. wouldn't be trying to steal the election for a Democrat. 		Whatever you are ... it's definitely overpaid.
@AndrewCFollett The final unofficial results from the state of Florida are not due until the Saturday afternoon AFTER the election.		I'll stop pretending that I didn't just google the state statutes if you'll stop pretending to be an expert from Florida.
@AndrewCFollett https://t.co/rWQb3mcN51
@AndrewCFollett That means 34K ballots in Broward could not be counted until AFTER the polls closed AND they were verified. 		Statewide there is an estimated 250K of these types of ballots. 		AND an unknown amount of overseas ballots that only have to be post-marked by election day.
@AndrewCFollett Dear overpaid moron --		Absentee ballots received after 5pm on Monday before the election &amp; on election day have to be verified one-by-one after the polls close. Provisional ballots must be verified as well in the same manner.
@AndrewCFollett Zzz... wake me up after the recount. 		Irregularities and issues happen — people’s votes shouldn’t be disqualified due to errors not of their own making.
@AndrewCFollett lolz... the only illegality going on is the unconstitutionally gerrymandered districts that continue to suppress the will of the people in states across the nation.

@realDonaldTrump Trump is upset because rich, talented &amp; famous men of color are resisting him and inequalities in his country and aren't afraid to speak up!
@realDonaldTrump He doesn't think it's a privilege for teams to come to the White House. He's barely there! He did all this tweeting from his golf course.
@realDonaldTrump That's why he attacked Curry and #Warriors because some players disagree with how he has treated disenfranchised people in this country.
@realDonaldTrump That's why his justice department is dismantling polices to address and improve policing in communities of color — because he doesn't care.
@realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't care about the anthem or our flag he cares about white supremacy and wants to silence those who resist clear inequalities.
@realDonaldTrump The conversation again is framed as black man disrespects Flag, anthem, etc. when these men are using their agency to address inequality.
@realDonaldTrump Fast forward to Trump's Friday rally where he attacks #Kaepernick &amp; calls him a son of a bitch for addressing police brutality.
@realDonaldTrump But of course because @realDonaldTrump and others are lazy they framed their protest as something else. Ignoring again POLICE BRUTALITY.
@realDonaldTrump That's why #Kaepernick and other players kneeled during games. Period. It wasn't to show disrespect to America.
@realDonaldTrump This whole conservation should have always been about POLICE BRUTALITY and police interaction with black men.
Everything about @realDonaldTrump and #TakeAKneeNFL is so frustrating because he made it all about him.
