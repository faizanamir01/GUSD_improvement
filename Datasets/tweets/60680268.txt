Luke was strikingly warm, the kind of person who walked through life with kind eyes. He was funny and real. He was everything you’d hope your favorite actor would be. Luke was taken from this world way too soon. I pray for his soul and for his family. https://t.co/EQyEHX4zed
My heart is broken. I feel so lucky to have met him and am forever grateful to @Brianteta for making that incredible surprise happen. https://t.co/LcF6Or1lIM
I took a nap and just woke up to this. My heart is totally broken. I spent my entire childhood in love with the character of Dylan McKay. When I finally got to meet him, Luke was one of the nicest people I’d ever met. He was taken from this world way too soon. 🙏 https://t.co/U6q5cMpg6j

Join us @foxandfriends 6-9am, big show coming up!
I’m a lifelong New Yorker. This city is loaded up with liberals trying to boss everyone’s lifestyle choices around while they do whatever they please. Don’t BS me, AOC. My BS meter is pretty solid.
BULL. I can’t stomach a phony. https://t.co/GGqlCVAxjT “Living in the world” involves making choices. “a subway station was just 138 feet from her Elmhurst campaign office...She listed 1,049 transactions for Uber, Lyft, Juno and other car services” https://t.co/q3gVjHfzIj
“By comparison, fellow freshman Rep. Max Rose — whose district is more than twice the size of AOC’s and, like hers, spans two boroughs — listed only 329 transactions for car services, totaling $6,091.29, campaign filings show.” https://t.co/q3gVjHfzIj
“her campaign embraced the friendly skies, logging 66 airline transactions costing $25,174.54...Democratic firebrand or her staff took Amtrak far less — only 18 times — despite high-speed rail being the cornerstone of her save-the-world strategy.” https://t.co/q3gVjHfzIj
“Ocasio-Cortez spent $29,365.70 on those emissions-spewing vehicles, along with car and van rentals — even though her Queens HQ was a one-minute walk to the 7 train.” https://t.co/q3gVjHfzIj
Fun week ahead! I’m co-hosting @foxandfriends 6-9am tomorrow, then joining the crew @TheFive Tuesday and Wednesday. xo

I bought 3 snake plants that I named Moe, Larry, and Curly, and Curly’s leaves seem to be, well, curling. This is not supposed to happen. What have I done?
This news has me so sad. https://t.co/4FT9l004Et Keeping Luke in my thoughts today and hoping for a full, fast recovery. He’s a pretty awesome guy. Surprised me for my birthday at The View and was an amazing sport about my love for 90210. Hoping he gets well soon. 🙏
Just once I’d like to be that person who can wait for the soup to cool and not burn my tongue into numbness. Just one time.

Yes, clearly the pressure of a TV career &amp; teeny tiny (huge) $65K an episode paycheck would drive a good, quality, sane person to pay people to fake a hate crime.	COME ON ALREADY.	I really hope that somehow this headline and column were products of very poorly written sarcasm. https://t.co/i5UaKh3W6S
@DanaPerino The best part is how you circled it to draw emphasis to his skill 🤣👍
Getting off Twitter because I see that the “ban the electoral college” groupies have taken center stage and that kind of moronic nonsense isn’t good for my rage.
You mean “your health,” not “their health.” I’m a woman.	The bill isn’t about a woman’s health right. It’s about born-alive babies’ rights. Hate to break it to you, but a born-alive baby is a human being in its own right. Save the nonsense for someone else.✌️ https://t.co/kJv8kAuRc9
This was a bill about an infant’s health rights. Save the bull for someone else, Dems. 	”would’ve done nothing more than insist that health-care providers treat children born alive after attempted abortions the same way that they’d treat any other infant” https://t.co/A1TLiAGr6r
Nonsense. I read the entire bill. Twice.	Couple it with Democrats proposing &amp;/or signing legislation in NY &amp; VA that expands abortion through end of 3rd trimester,with intentionally vague language to justify it as far as at term, while in labor.Shame on them for their inhumanity. https://t.co/b6iuU8GiNe
Reminder👇 https://t.co/GLTv9bekje
Bull. It’s a born-alive human. That baby (a.k.a human being) has rights of his/her own. I’d like to know what medical circumstance (hint: none) would call for not doing everything you can to protect a human that is born alive from a botched abortion. https://t.co/rlceJTCNm7
Really sit with this. A full-term baby is born alive after a failed abortion. What kind of sick individual votes down a measure to protect that person’s life? This is some evil extremist stuff, @SenateDems. And I mean evil.
Hey @SenateDems, explain your horrific disapproval of “Any infant born alive after an abortion or within a hospital, clinic, or other facility has the same claim to the protection of the law that would arise for any newborn, or for any person who comes to a hospital...” https://t.co/kmoj2ZFg9P

The fact that he has the backing he does should make you nauseous. He is blatantly advocating for policies that would destroy this country. The good news? His ideas aren’t based on historically effective policy, making him the easiest politician to debate outside of AOC. https://t.co/p9oEmCTQad

The bill is an atrocity. Prohibits effective wall prototypes, prohibits building a wall in certain areas, incentivizes child trafficking, caps # of ICE detentions. National emergency declaration debate aside, Trump is in big political trouble with his base if he signs this.

The yearbook is in the school library? If that’s the case, seems incredibly odd for them to not have known about the existence of a supposedly unofficial yearbook with images/captions that hadn’t been approved by faculty or administration. Come on now. https://t.co/cc1bYPKj0L
A yearboook is a representation/reflection of a school. It’s part of a school’s brand. If they allowed students to print a yearbook with the school’s name on it with zero faculty/administration approval or accountability, that’s also a big problem. (And incredibly dumb.) https://t.co/Reddf5Sqkl
I have never in my history of working in 3 schools (K-12, high school, and college) seen a school yearbook published without any faculty supervision or approval. That sounds very odd to me. And if it’s true, it’s insane &amp; completely irresponsible on the  part of the school. https://t.co/Reddf5Sqkl
2) Also—I’ve taught at a high school, college, and K-12 school. There was faculty supervision of every yearbook publication, including captions, image selection, story writing, etc. Absolutely insane and atrocious to me that this pic was published in a yearbook. https://t.co/yzlalYL8u5
1 of 2) Story is horrific on many levels.  Painful imagery.Also—He posed for this pic as 25-yr-old adult in 1984 &amp; chose it to be featured on his yearbook page?!And—what school would publish this?I was literary editor of my high school yearbook, every pic needed faculty approval. https://t.co/yzlalYL8u5

I don’t agree with Schultz on plenty. But I will take on anyone who disparages an American-dream story brought to life. You don’t like the American dream? Cool. Move somewhere where it’s not possible, enjoy yourself, and leave the rest of us here alone.
It’s rich that Left disparages Schultz, who grew up very poor in low-income NY housing, as out of touch..yet elevates AOC, who went to school &amp; lived mostly in Westchester County (&amp; misled the public about it, forcing her to edit her own bio), as some American dream personified.
Left’s attack on @HowardSchultz as an out-of-touch billionaire makes my blood boil. He grew up poor in Canarsie in low-income housing. This is the definition of the American dream. Left’s loathing of him is a window into their loathing of capitalism &amp; what this country stands for

Media game of “Let’s paint the billionaire as unrelatable” is so dumb.	Guess what?	I grew up in a middle class house, was a teacher for years, dug myself out of debt I accrued to make a career switch, &amp; have no idea what Cheerios cost b/c...I don’t eat cereal. ✌️	So.

My bottom-line:Parents, teach kids to walk away from hostile situations, to be respectful, &amp; to not engage when confused in chaotic situations. Media who immediately ran with the edited clip? You have no business having the job you do &amp; should be removed for those who seek truth.
8) I can’t hear every word in the video b/c of sound quality. Can I assure that no Covington boys said anything mean? No. Maybe they did &amp; their parents should handle that. What I can assure is that no respectable reporter would’ve run that story without watching the whole video.
7) Covington boys made mistakes. They shouldn’t have engaged with the Black Hebrew Israelites who were harassing them. They shouldn’t have engaged in a stare-down with Phillips. Even if they were confused as to his role in it all and what was happening, they should’ve walked away
6) That heavily edited and heavily circulated moment missed the entire preceding and following context, without which you can’t possibly attempt to understand the encounter between the boys and Phillips.
5) It appears to me that Covington boys originally thought Phillips was chanting with them, confusion ensued (they say as much repeatedly), and the stare-down occurs. But it’s key that the Phillips encounter occurred after Black Hebrew Israelites nearby had been harassing them.
4) If you watch the entire video, you’re likely fuming that the highly edited clip circulated by media is a screenshot. Omits Black Hebrew Israelites harassing Covington boys before &amp; after Nathan Phillips enters. Phillips enters &amp; confusion ensues.
3) I guess no one in media who spread the edited copy watched the Black Hebrew Israelites continuously harass the Covington boys &amp; mock them preceding (and following) the entrance of the Native American veteran? (Watch below at 1:11). https://t.co/LLdg5aZvrK
2) How many in media watched Black Hebrew Israelites call Covington Catholic school group “young Klansmen” &amp; “school shooters” &amp; anti-gay slurs? Or when they said “no peace till blood is shed” &amp; complained that the Bible gives rights to homosexuals? 1:20 - https://t.co/LLdg5aZvrK
1) How many in media watched the full video before reporting? Did you see Covington Catholic school students being harassed by the Black Hebrew Israelites, who uses repeated racist &amp; anti-gay slurs against white &amp; black kids in the group? Start at 1:20 - https://t.co/LLdg5aZvrK
I knew something was wrong with the original edited video that was cut &amp; spread by some in media to immediately try to humiliate &amp; belittle these high school boys. The real story below. And yes, I watched the whole video of the incident, over an hour. https://t.co/kSWIMe8Ul2

Hated it. Was a way for the writer to pick Joey/Dawson through Dawson’s TV show without actually putting them together in life. Hated Jen’s death and felt like it was a bad choice. And I liked Pacey a lot, but not to end up w/ Joey. Wasn’t her soul mate. And she admits as much. https://t.co/CngOCZOwjC
Keri Russell...but you were close :) https://t.co/FP2IfTBrLT
Also, I think I would’ve picked Noel, though I loved the character of Ben by the end too. (I also would’ve picked Dawson, though, so there’s that.) Okay, that’s a wrap on my 90s TV drama take...for the moment.😉
Watched the entire 90s series Felicity. Loved it, including the time-travel twist &amp; how it makes you think about whether you’d somehow make the same choices again if you could go back. Best character? Meghan. And unlike Dawson’s Creek, this ending feels right for the characters.
Love her. https://t.co/duR7CmvJ05

Yep! And a lot of it is happening already &amp; has been for some time. I traced back where it started and how Silicon Valley studied behavioral science to figure out how to make gaming/social media robots out of us. And why we allowed it. #DoNotDisturb https://t.co/jOGs2Xmzq0
If you haven’t seen Ex Machina, watch it. Think about it. Then look at your Alexa, Siri, &amp; think about what’s next. I wrote #DoNotDisturb b/c at some point, while buried in my phone &amp; the next cool tech feature, I forgot how scary it can get. Take a minute to think about it all.

Hey @SenSchumer,the wall isn’t for @realDonaldTrump.It’s for national security &amp; to address a humanitarian crisis at the border. You’re not spiting him,you’re spiting all Americans &amp; encouraging a system where people journey through horrific, deadly conditions to cross illegally. https://t.co/Dyal5BWJWq

If I’m confusing because I support Trump at times &amp; not at others, giving credit to surprising people at surprising times, I’ll take that. I’m not part of a party, but I am principled, and that means holding both sides accountable. https://t.co/6jz65BqXCF
I’m the same I’ve always been, which is that I support his handling of certain issues and disagree with his handling of others. It would be really easy for me to toe the line robotically for a party or politician, but that’s not my style. Here to be honest. https://t.co/7rJTdHuOJq

If you’re wondering if it’s possible to eat 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes made into latkes in one sitting, the answer is yes.
Stop asking yourself “what social media did to people.” Start asking instead who you became in these spaces, how you decided to treat people here, &amp; when it became normalized to comb through people’s long-past posts with the intent of ruining their present realities.
Been (happily) off the grid.Story about Kyler Murray isn’t about social media. It’s about what the hell happened to people-digging up old tweets to try to destroy someone,forgetting that we sometimes say dumb things,then grow up &amp; do better. A scary time to be a plain old human.

It’s a holistic vet. For the cleaning, it means they don’t use anesthesia. She loves them! In a general sense, the vet is like a holistic doc for humans, where supplements/food suggestions/overall health outlook comes from a whole-food, non-toxic, prevention kind of place. https://t.co/lMMlRKwITU

Spare me the “it was a job interview” anti-Kavanaugh talking point.A “job interview” where you ignored his 12 yrs as a federal judge,307 legal opinions &amp; 6 background checks,willing to instantly destroy him over uncorroborated,unsubstantiated allegations.Job interview my ass.✌️
This is so disgraceful. I have no words. https://t.co/Zzj2rK2iwz
I’m not a Republican.There was no evidence/corroboration of sexual assault re: Kavanaugh.If there were, I was ready to hold him accountable.I don’t advocate punishing people/labeling them rapists/assaulters w/out evidence/corroboration.Bye now.Your personal attacks are boring. https://t.co/85fqxZcXnK
My favorite adults are the kinds that feel the need to write stuff like this https://t.co/m5iXkORP6M
3rd option:Review their 6 former FBI background checks,seek corroboration of allegations via sworn testimonies.Add 1000-page supplemental FBI investigation w/ 10 interviews.And if no corroboration is found,you don’t punish anyone for unsubstantiated claims.This is still America. https://t.co/pJ1DApHpvr
Can you imagine being the type of person who is mean just to be mean? I’ll never understand it. Don’t let the trolls win. https://t.co/H71s9LpCKQ
FYI:Was never about Kavanaugh for me.He wasn’t even my pick for the court.But I will fight for a country where people are presumed innocent until proven guilty,where facts matter,where no one-including those I disagree w/-can have their lives derailed over unsubstantiated claims
Suppose someone accused you of gang rape from 30 yrs ago. You vehemently deny it, insist it’s untrue.Despite no evidence or corroboration against you,you are painted as guilty instantly, your reputation dragged through mud. Do you want to live in that world? I sure as hell don’t. https://t.co/XDCjnArPCq
Getting labeled a gang rapist and sexual assaulter, even though there’s been not one bit of corroboration of those claims, is slightly worse than getting your toys taken away. But you do you. https://t.co/aj5qCDqQ9h
False. 10 FBI interviews, including Judge, Keyser, Smith (3 alleged by Ford to have been at party), Ramirez, classmates Gaudette and Garrett. Ford &amp; Kavanaugh already cross-examined in sworn testimonies. No corroboration found. And nothing found in Kavanaugh’s prior 6 FBI checks. https://t.co/LVD6BL4CbK
Job interviews don’t involve criminalizing people based on uncorroborated, unsubstantiated claims.If one is accused of gang rape/assault w/ no evidence/corroboration, denies it &amp; is the object of a massive smear campaign anyway, he/she better damn well be angry.	Back at ya, babe. https://t.co/A0XjaQrodi
Or...	In conclusion:	Our country reaffirmed today that we don’t criminalize people based on uncorroborated, unsubstantiated allegations.		And anyone seeking to undermine the presumption of innocence so pivotal to our republic has no place in our House or Senate. https://t.co/8CIj6k07BO
You forgot the part about how a civilization could be destroyed by criminalizing people on the basis of uncorroborated, unsubstantiated allegations, thus eradicating justice. https://t.co/2aOnUuTPX7

Always be on the side that defends the right to non-violent, peaceful protest and condemns violent, destructive protest. This is still America. Protecting the voices of those we disagree with is our job too.

Any other women find it deeply offensive that they use the phony “pro-women” handle @womensmarch to degrade women they don’t like? https://t.co/1Vu1f4QsX7
If something happens to me, and I tell the story about it to someone years later, that person I relay my story to is not a corroborating witness to the original incident. If you’re a lawyer making that argument, you know better, so stop.
That’s b/c this isn’t a corroborating witness. Ford’s legal team well knows that.FBI’s job was to interview people who were potential witnesses to alleged assault 36 yrs ago, people she claimed were present at gathering.A corroborating witness is not someone you relay a story to. https://t.co/1eAaxGF7jm

In a cafe listening to people talk Kavanaugh.Anti-Kavanaugh comments are all emotional.Not 1 fact in the bunch.Not 1 mention of evidence.When you battle liberalism, you often battle emotional hysteria.Challenge is how to make your facts sound as good as their emotional hysteria.
Ha! Meet my best friend, Dean. He thinks Spider-Man is cooler than Superman, but don’t hold it against him.😮🤭😂 https://t.co/uiCLm99fNn
This is what happens when someone is viewed as being easily manipulated by a mob. https://t.co/woGgWKrhM5
.@lisamurkowski, a “no” vote on someone who faced completely unsubstantiated/uncorroborated allegations from 3 decades ago, where the FBI’s additional investigation found zero corroboration, sets a very dangerous precedent. It also empowers the worst in agenda-driven politicians.
100% true.	“...FBI’s job was to find people who could corroborate Ford’s sworn testimony and called the demand for her to be interviewed by the FBI an “absurd” one.		“What would she do, change her testimony?”...“She could only hurt herself if she changed her testimony.” https://t.co/lSV8aJuZlb
Life lesson: Don’t try to please people whose minds are already made up to be displeased.
Pretty sad to me that so many are protesting to defend the undermining of their own presumption of innocence or their right to not be criminalized by uncorroborated allegations they deny. If it could happen to one of us, it could happen to any of us. https://t.co/YI9v0gLAvA

Women could just as easily have their entire lives wrongfully derailed by unsubstantiated, uncorroborated allegations. That’s the system you’re defending, which should be terrifying to all. Stop using lazy talking points, it’s boring. https://t.co/eAWbIFl9pL
“So, six people have now said publicly that they played a drinking game called Devil’s Triangle that originated at Kavanaugh’s high school. Time to retire that one.” https://t.co/0I0Ok4AksD
Democrats &amp; left-wing media now foaming at the mouth because FBI’s 1000-page report found zero corroboration of allegations. So now it’s time for them to argue Kavanaugh’s really a perpetrator anyway, FBI just didn’t look hard enough. Ignore self-righteous lunacy. Hold the vote.
When asking for an FBI investigation, Democrats repeatedly referenced the Clarence Thomas investigation, saying it only took 3 days to get an answer. Let’s cut the bull. No amount of time, and no amount of people with uncorroborated claims, would ever be enough for them. The end. https://t.co/PwBx24GEz4
I could watch this on replay all day long. https://t.co/HYNQPNeCkD
Most in media have exposed themselves on this story to be exactly what many know them to be—agenda-driven, completely biased, champions of some and smear machines of others. If anyone’s eyes were closed before, they’re sure open now. https://t.co/y50Wm2JXlH

2018 media: a place where if someone with a concerning legal past makes unsubstantiated, uncorroborated serious allegations that the network can’t remotely verify, but the story may help discredit someone the left doesn’t like, the network conducts a national TV interview anyway. https://t.co/kWOYLxTo6Z
Many expressing fear their sons could be accused without evidence/corroboration &amp; instantly labeled a perpetrator anyway. I remind you: it could happen to your daughters too. If any accuser is to be instantly believed &amp; evidence/corroboration cease to matter, everyone is at risk.

I threw crushed ice from a snow cone “for some unknown reason”	at a boy in the sixth grade. I’ll be awaiting commentary from The New York Times.
The only silver lining in the unhinged commentary on Kavanaugh by many is that the unhinged have been exposed. Also OH MY GOD I HEARD HE THREW ICE AT SOMEONE IN COLLEGE.
I thought @tvkatesnow asked some good questions, but I find it alarming that a network would offer a national platform to an accuser whose claims they couldn’t verify at all. These are uncorroborated, unsubstantiated claims from a source with a concerning legal history. https://t.co/I5bAjE87vP
Kavanaugh DID NOT deny drinking in college, or even drinking too much sometimes. “I drank beer with my friends...Almost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out.”
OH MY GOD HE THREW ICE ON SOMEONE IN A COLLEGE FIGHT	I honestly can’t with this story. I just can’t. https://t.co/jESXfw6fHl

Make no mistake, THIS is what it’s about. Which is why no number of FBI investigates into uncorroborated, unsubstantiated allegations will be enough for Harris, Hirono, and other Democrats. Reminder: Kavanaugh has never once said he would overturn Roe v Wade, not once. https://t.co/NAXa4b7jJk
As I’ve said, it won’t matter to most Democrats if FBI finds nothing. Their goal is to destroy Kavanaugh’s name/reputation &amp; paint him as dangerous even if there’s zero evidence of that.

Co-hosting @TheFive today, I have lots to say on Kavanaugh and more. Don’t miss it, 5pm @FoxNews.
As a woman, let me say this. I’m deeply offended by the idea of believing what I say immediately by virtue of my gender. How incredibly demeaning to me. Believe my facts. Believe my evidence. Believe my sworn testimony. But my gender shouldn’t even be part of your equation.
I’m so tired of people who judge others based on age, race, or gender. https://t.co/YoSI83dF8T
I’d argue her initial questions to Kavanaugh were even more pointed. The burden of proof rests with the accuser. Has to. B/c without evidence/corroboration, an allegation is just that—an allegation. No one wants a world where an unsubstantiated, uncorroborated claim yields guilt. https://t.co/MxQCg9fNiO
“‘Mitchell spelled it out and was clear with senators that she could not take this anywhere near a courtroom,’”...She told them she would not charge the Supreme Court nominee and reportedly said she wouldn't even seek a search warrant.”	https://t.co/xyz8QDo5po
One thing for sure is that the media coverage of Kavanaugh/Ford has been a solid reminder of how painfully biased and agenda-driven most in supposedly objective media are. Distrust in media will be at an all-time high, and deservedly so.
You’re not embarrassed to showcase such blatant bias on a front page story with those 2 side-by-side photos? It’s stunning to me how some people sleep peacefully at night. https://t.co/aFq23FuTkg

And in addition, 2 of the 3 are vouching for Kavanaugh’s character. He’s had 6 FBI background checks. 6. Once again, I’m not saying Ford didn’t give a credible testimony. What I’m saying is that evidence &amp; corroboration do &amp; should matter, and there’s none here thus far. https://t.co/J4MjygqzwB
I’m not even a Republican,Jehmu.  Leland did say that, but that’s not corroboration. It’s not a witness, not evidence,not something that takes this out of the realm of an uncorroborated, unsubstantiated claim. And whether or not you or I believe her also doesn’t change that fact. https://t.co/ISn4Wo9A4C
PJ: no knowledge of party &amp; “I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women”	Judge: doesn’t recall party &amp; “I never saw Brett act in the manner that Dr. Ford describes”	Leland: doesn’t know Kavanaugh,no recollection of ever being at any party w/ him https://t.co/PlquOMIVp1
If someone accused you of assault without evidence or corroboration, you vehemently denied it, &amp; the people your accuser alleged were at the scene also denied it completely, would you want to be treated as guilty?

Emotionally, I have sympathy for Ford &amp; Kavanaugh. Factually, all of the outside people Ford alleged were at the gathering refuted her claim. No one has corroborated it. No evidence. You can’t derail anyone’s career/reputation over an unsubstantiated, uncorroborated allegation.
I have to tell you that after listening to many of these Democrats today and how they behaved, I likely wouldn’t have been able to contain myself either. That’s the honest truth. I think he had a legitimate outburst of disgust and frustration. https://t.co/lv8gYFq0x2
You know, @maziehirono, when I’ve interviewed for jobs, I haven’t had to defend myself against uncorroborated, evidence-free allegations of gang rape and assault while my name was being destroyed. To label what’s happened here a “job interview” is fundamentally absurd.
And one of the dumbest. https://t.co/9SFFeGAWxb

To those lecturing on how Kavanaugh seems so angry,I invite you to be accused,without evidence or corroboration,of gang rape &amp; assault you completely deny,watch those allegations paint you as a monster through media &amp; threaten to derail your whole life—let’s see how angry you get

I imagine that @LindseyGrahamSC just spoke for many. Wow. That’s a way to pull no punches.

Senate granted hearing delays due to Ford’s alleged fear of flying. Mitchell uncovers that Ford travels extensively by plane, quite often, for work and hobby.
It’s key to remember that all of the people Ford has mentioned as being at the gathering—Judge, Kavanaugh, and her friend Leland Keyser—have denied that this happened. They have disputed her claim. We’ll hear from Kavanaugh today. Subpoena Judge and Keyser.

This opening statement by Feinstein is precisely the kind of manipulative grandstanding I can’t stomach. She should be embarrassed to include outside unsubstantiated, uncorroborated allegations in her statement today. She’s not, but she should be.
Feinstein is defensive because she knows damn well she sat on those allegations for weeks when she could’ve brought them up in many ways while maintaining Ford’s confidentiality. So she takes a dig at Grassley that sounds like a 3rd-grader caught cheating on a test.
This guy is an absolute joke. So are media outlets that continue to elevate his platform unchallenged. https://t.co/QJcKKvSLmO
Actually, Swetnick called it “gang rape” by a “train” of boys, repeatedly, habitually, the drugging and raping of different high school girls at over 10 parties she attended over and over as a 19-year-old adult. What you are saying is not her allegation. Read her statement. https://t.co/C49n4ZHGLp

I graduated high school in 1996 before the social media age. I also taught high school for years and was a dean. My questions about the Swetnick story stand as noted. Awaiting witness testimony, corroboration of the incidents, evidence before drawing any conclusions. https://t.co/aoS44T0ANs
Honest questions. Why would a high school graduate repeatedly attend underage parties where fellow women were allegedly gang-raped? And say nothing? Women were allegedly gang-raped regularly &amp; not 1 person said a word to anyone? Word didn’t travel through the school?
On the Swetnick claims: Once again, I have no idea what did/didn’t happen because I wasn’t there. I have many questions. For an allegation of habitual gang rapes at parties with lines of boys awaiting turns, there should be plenty of witnesses to hear from. Let’s start there.

We don’t live in a country where you are guilty until proven innocent. We live in one where the accuser and the accused have a forum to tell their story and be heard. Facts, evidence, corroboration, patterns of behavior, testimony under oath—these things matter. The end.
Grassley has offered Ford a public or private hearing, one in CA, or a phone option.FBI has declined to investigate b/c this doesn’t involve a potential federal crime. You left out that Kavanaugh had 6 background checks over the yrs. Maybe tell the truth &amp; stop playing politics? https://t.co/EFg82wPUzg

The world would be a better place if we all remembered that before social media, people often thought things through before putting their opinions out there, and that was a good thing.
It’s amazing to me how many people rush to make rash statements and judgements on social media on a serious topic while evidence and details are still emerging. Maybe give it a minute?

Evil lunatic. Biggest disgrace is he was only charged with 1 count of animal cruelty &amp; released on $1,000 bail. For murdering an innocent dog? Disgraceful. I’d set that bail way higher and ban him from owning an animal again.     Karma finds people like this. https://t.co/X5eQ14EICH

The fact that this administration’s policy on Russia is a big improvement from the Obama years doesn’t change the fact that Trump’s comments yesterday were embarrassing. It is possible to defend the administration’s policy while at the same time criticizing his personal comments.
The apocalypse is coming! Bringing the tornado from The Wizard of Oz! https://t.co/b4DSyUSwsj
There are those who will tell you what you want to hear, and then those who will tell you the truth. Appreciate the latter.
If you’re on the right and twisting and contorting to defend Trump’s comments today, revisit what you said about Obama’s “apology tours” &amp; his hot mic “After my election, I’ll have more flexibility” comment to Medvedev. Our country deserves our consistency.   I condemn it all.
...Trump playing the “Our intelligence officials said one thing, but Putin says another” card, as if he’s not sure who to trust, is very disturbing to watch. Also, it was not the time or place, with his adversary (not competitor!) beside him, to take up his issues with Democrats.
...My stomach began turning when Trump insisted that Putin is not an adversary, but a competitor, with the aside that he was complimenting Putin. Disgraceful. To hear an American President place a moral equivalence between leadership here and Putin’s leadership is nauseating...
I was recording my audiobook most of today in studio and only caught a couple of clips of the press conference. Wanted to refrain from full comment till I saw the whole thing. I can now say it turned my stomach at many points...

3 of 3) If you’re a media member suddenly bothered by horrific border conditions just because you hate Trump, I have no patience for you. Where were you during the Obama yrs, asleep? Some of us cared THEN and NOW. That’s why we advocate for a secure border consistently. The end.
2 of 3) Secure the damn border. The high numbers of migrant women that are sexually assaulted &amp; Mexican cartel brutality should’ve been a reason long ago to prioritize border security and get it done.
1 of 3) Children should never be separated from their parents at the border. The end . Fix it.
Tweet is a condemnation of selective media outrage at atrocious border conditions that have been ongoing for years, long before Trump took office. Of course it must be fixed, but journalists who turned a blind eye to it all during Obama’s years are a joke. https://t.co/BPx8YavmdB

I hope Trump succeeds w/ negotiations with N Korea &amp; gets total, verifiable denuclearization. Let’s see what happens. But I don’t like any language that praises a murderous dictator. And I believe Kim Jong Un’s horrific human rights violations must be addressed as a priority.
So it wasn’t okay for Obama to negotiate with murderous tyrants without preconditions or to praise them, but it’s okay for Trump? No, sorry. I’m watching many who criticized one now condone another. Integrity and principled consistency would be great.

I think this Comey book tour is absolutely hysterical so far. It’s a hilarious self-righteous pity party. I’m all for fully investigating what needs to be investigated, but this guy is too much. 😂
If Trump did indeed ask Comey for loyalty, Comey is a grown-ass man and should’ve said no, that’s not my job, right there on the spot.
Violation of 18 U.S.C 793. Espionage Act. As a reminder, she lied repeatedly about sending classified docs over an unsecured server after signing documents at State indicating that she would follow proper protocol. https://t.co/kdZQ8T0aa0

Given assurance to place a puppy in an overhead bin? That is preposterous. United should have never ever suggested that, but as a pet owner, you have a duty to be a thinking person. Should people put their infants up there too if a flight attendant says so? STOP IT. https://t.co/OdHuSBlN6r
I would like to meet everyone on that @united flight who sat near that puppy and saw him get put in the overhead and did nothing. As well as the dog owner who allowed this atrocity and the idiotic flight attendant who suggested it. I have some words for you all. You sicken me.

Celebrities hire private, armed security quite often, which they have every right to. But if they’re going to do that, and recognize its importance, then they shouldn’t try to prevent law-abiding citizens who can’t afford armed security from arming themselves. https://t.co/Waz22B827A

Just because I wouldn't kneel doesn't mean I won't defend your right to. I fight for freedom, whether I agree with people's choices or not.
PS--You wouldn't want to live in a country without the right to kneel. Along with that comes the loss of many freedoms. That's not America. https://t.co/CC7NYEhp18

I believe in low taxes, health care plans that empower YOU, not the government, school choice. Policies centered on freedom and people.
That means I can oppose both Obamacare &amp; a bad GOP alternative bill that overregulates you.That's ideological consistency over Party loyalty
That means I don't fit into a "Republican" or "Democrat" box. I don't believe in big government, as so many Dems AND GOP selectively protect
