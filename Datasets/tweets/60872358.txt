@arielsobelle Her Muslim faith, or black color are no excuse for anti- Semitism. They have nothing to do with people rightly criticizing her anti- Semitic comments. Why didnT @repmarkpocan and @RepJayapal condemn her?
@repmarkpocan @RepJayapal Why didn't you condemn @IlhanMN when she accused Israel's supporters of conflicting loyalties? @ADL
@IlhanMN Maybe it is because of your unrelenting anti- Semitic comments?	I can't understand how the people in the 5th U. S. Congressional District of MN let an anti- Semite like you represent them in DC!

@stellacreasy Recognizing a non existant Palestinian state without the Palestinians recognizing Israel as a Jewish country and signing a peace agreement with it, only provides an incentive to the Palestinians not to come to the negotiating table.
@Gunga_Morgan @kinstery @DanielOConnel18 @biggolls81 @COLRICHARDKEMP What about Palestinians tying up IED's to kites and baloons and launching them across the border, to Israel? One of these flying bombs actually damaged a house in Israel this week!

@jeremycorbyn 's biased attack on Israel's human rights record is based on the @UN 's automatic Arab- Muslim majority's hostility to Israel.

לחץ העבודה על החדרניות בבתי- המלון הוא בלתי אנושי. כמות החדרים שהן מתבקשות לנקות בכל יום באה תמיד על חשבון איכות הניקיון. התוצאה היא כפי שראינו בתחקיר המלונות של חברת החדשות.
ממצאי תחקיר המלונות הם מדאיגים. משרד התיירות חייב להגביר את הפיקוח על ניקיון בתי- המלון, באותה דרך שבה חברת החדשות ביצעה את התחקיר. לא צריך לפחד גם להטיל קנסות על בתי- מלון שלא מקפידים.

@RashidaTlaib @CNN @marclamonthill He called for the destruction of the the State of Israel - the national homeland of the people of Israel in the Land of Israel. He did not criticize any specific Israeli policy. That is anti- Semitism according to the international definition.
@washingtonpost He didn't criticize Israel - he called for its destruction!
@scarlettrabe @johnpaulpagano @ShowMeRep2020 @CNN @UN Your naive if you really believe that. That slogan is a call to deny the Jewish people the right to self- determination. It is a call to destroy the only Jewish country in the world.

Before the elections @IlhanMN told Jewish voters that she doesn't support @BDSmovement , because it  isn't effective. Now that she won the elections, she says she does. Did  she promise the Jews not to support @BDSmovement only in order to get elected?
@JennyRathbone Anti- Semitism is the anti- Semite's fault, not the Jews'. The Jews are not occupiers in the Land of Israel. Israel has a right, and indeed a responsibility to protect Israelis against terror.
@JennyRathbone siege mentality? No wonder. Hate crimes on an anti- Semitic background make up 60% of all the hate crimes in the world. Including the attack against the synagogue in Pittsburgh.

הניאו- נאצי שביצע את הטבח בפיטסבורג לא יודע מה ההבדל בין אורתודוכסים, רפורמים וקונסרבטיבים. גם כשישראל מקבלת תרומות מאמריקה לא אכפת לה לאיזה זרם ביהדות שייך התורם. האם זה לא מספיק בשביל להכיר רשמית בזרמים הליברלים ביהדות?

Israel was attacked tonight. The Palestinians fired 2 rockets at Israel. one fell in Beer Sheba, hit a private home and injured 6 people. The other rocket fell in the sea, off the coast of one of Israel's biggest cities in central Israel.
