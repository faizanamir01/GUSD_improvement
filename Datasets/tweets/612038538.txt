@VampireNox @thehill Congratulations. I've worked in healthcare for 20 yrs. I know Medicare vs. Medicaid, how they're each structured, funded, what's covered (&amp; what isn't), and who has oversight over each. Medicaid is much better. And Medicaid is already expanded (w/ buy-in options) in many states.
@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 I think you're referring to the House bill #HR1? It's a fantastic bill!  But you're right, I don't think that will pass the Senate. Mitch McConnell called it a power-grab or something like that (because eliminating barriers to voter access is apparently a bad thing).
@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 Thanks. I'm pretty familiar with the various gerrymandering cases. I live in NC, and our district maps have been in litigation off &amp; on for 10+ yrs. The problem is the maps are drawn by state legislatures, so the only federal oversight is in the courts (after the fact).

@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 I hope you're right. But gerrymandering and voter suppression is still a huge problem. A state can be majority Democrat and still have a majority-Republican state legislature. (Example: NC). This is a constant fight, but national Dems seem to forget about it between elections.

@VampireNox @thehill Medicaid for all would be a far smoother transition. In fact, the two major "Medicare for All" bills are structured like Medicaid. Not at all like Medicare. And there's no overlap between FICA payroll taxes and Medicaid funding, so seniors won't lose their earned benefit.
@bdicarlo1 @Rosie @thomaskaine5 Sorry, but he went too far. That wasn't decency, it was dismissing the entire LGBTQ community. I just hope he doesn't run, because it would be very difficult for me to vote for him now.
@clements_dexter @Rosie @thomaskaine5 Nope. After what he said this week, Biden gets a "No" from me. He's done.
@BidenHarris20 @Geenak @Rosie @thomaskaine5 After what he said this week, Biden gets a big "No" from me. Sorry.

@IamJenEndres @RealDeanCain @Gruntstyle @RealJTP If you can find info on that, I'm definitely interested. I'm not trying to be argumentative, but unfortunately there are a lot of orgs out there that ask for donations but aren't up-front about where the money goes. And since they're not a 501c3, there's no way to know for sure.
@IamJenEndres @RealDeanCain @Gruntstyle @RealJTP Do you mean Shield Our Schools? Where does it say they donate proceeds? I looked around their website but I can't find anything saying that. They're selling a product, and have lots of info on how to be a "corporate partner". But I can't find info on direct donations to schools.
@not_goddess ...or I could set it up and she could just make minor adjustments as needed.
@not_goddess Thanks! I might give it a try. My Dad had a stroke &amp; it affected his speech. But he's not so good with smart phones &amp; tablets, so the less complicated (&amp; more customizable) the better. My mom could probably handle the setup, but if it's too complicated it'll just stress her out.

@RealDeanCain @CindisPLace @Gruntstyle @RealJTP So... what are they doing? Other than selling T-shirts for a profit? Seriously, I don't get it. Are they donating the proceeds? Are they working to get better funding for schools so they can update the security features in the buildings?
@CindisPLace @RealDeanCain @Gruntstyle @RealJTP Yikes! I did a quick Google search, and although I refuse to visit the site  (I could never get the stink of that tracking cookie off of me), the Image results alone are... creepy AF.  😱

@CindisPLace @RealDeanCain @Gruntstyle @RealJTP That's a for-profit company selling the T-shirt. Are they donating the proceeds to schools? I don't get it.
@RealDeanCain @Gruntstyle @RealJTP Okay. But I'd rather not click on a .com link to a merchant site to find out more. Do you have a link to something other than that website?

@Bryan_10s @RandomBlack4 @The_Next_Book @wildnots @Radande @jemelehill It's a safety issue too. The player could have easily (reflexively) turned around and accidentally hit him. I feel bad that the kid was embarrased (or even got scared), but it's an important lesson. I think Westbrook handled it as well as could he expected.
@Bryan_10s @Radande @The_Next_Book @jemelehill The more important question is how  does a kid think that's okay? It's one thing if the player was facing him and he waved hello or something like that. But he HIT him on the arm - while his back was turned - to get his attention (in the middle of a game). That's not okay.
@RandomBlack4 @The_Next_Book @wildnots @Bryan_10s @Radande @jemelehill I'm not sure if it's a cultural issue. I'm white (from NorthEast) &amp; my parents would have been Furious if I did that. They'd probably make me go sit in the car... by myself... in the cold! 😂 (I'm not entirely kidding). And the kid didn't just touch him accidentally. He HIT him!

@DO_CONFIDENCE @DrDinD @thehill Sorry I missed your reply earlier. Thanks for the input. I tend to agree with you. Aside from that, many descendants of slaves aren't able to definitively document their lineage (understandably). So I don't see how reparations would even work in that case.

@ballerinaX @blanarph @1101110112 Yup.

Then I got a headache.🤔  Anyway I'm pretty confident saying they're not to be trusted.
@_tatvamasi @conorduffy_7 @Noahpinion @MerriamWebster Yup. I took an extended break from Twitter *and* cable news last month. I might need to take another one soon. Also it's annoying AF that the news networks aren't covering ANYTHING except the Trump circus. There's other stuff going on in the country (and the world!).
@ballerinaX @blanarph @1101110112 So, they have a 501(c)4  AND a 501(c)3?
@deveer_f @blanarph Just to clarify, they're not right-wing money. They're basically in the "Bernie wing" of the far left #fauxgressives. They're loosely connected with AOC and Justice 'Democrats' (a spinout PAC from Bernie's 2016 campaign, comprised mostly of Non-Dems). And they attack real Dems.
@ballerinaX @blanarph @1101110112 There are several "Sunrise" groups. So which is which? So far I've seen: 		1.

@MuppetMastery @Franktheshank88 Yup. Some of the regulations could (in theory) be put back in place via legislation in Congress. But without a Dem majority in the Senate, it wouldn't be easy.
@AllanMcHz @Franktheshank88 Thank you! If someone is genuinely interested, I absolutely love helping people learn new things. And I love learning things from other people!! Maybe that's why it's so frustrating when I encounter people who have zero intellectual curiosity &amp; think science is somehow political.
@MuppetMastery @Franktheshank88 I remember laughing, then being really sad. Mostly sad. It's a constant battle against willful ignorance and propaganda for political gain. Republicans never fought so hard against climate science until Al Gore started talking about it. Then suddenly it was a liberal conspiracy.
@Theon_Orbis ALL OF IT!! STOP BEING SHEEP! 😱
@MuppetMastery @Franktheshank88 Even if someone has doubts that it's entirely a man made effect, I can deal with that if it's a rational conversation. But this idea that climate science a "hoax". As if scientists across the globe have conspired for decades -- and for what purpose? These are not rational people.
@Theon_Orbis THERMODYNAMICS IS A HOAX!!! 😂
@MuppetMastery @Franktheshank88 Lol, OK. Since you asked nicely. 😊  But I still don't plan to engage with anti-science nutballs anymore. It's a colossal waste of time &amp; energy. And tbh it's a bit depressing to keep being reminded there are actually people like that out there, and many  are raising children. 😢

@bluemoonandrew @symscons @SenhorRaposa Based on what I've seen so far, if Kamala keeps trying to cater to the far left (a mistake, imho) then she puts her chances in the South in jeopardy. And the far left would never vote for her anyway (or for anyone else), as long as Bernie is running.

@Engineervlsi @alanblinder Exactly. And if Harris withdraws, I think GOP gets to put in a new candidate. I'm not sure if that means a new primary, or if the party can just put in Pittinger (who lost to Harris in the primary). Either way, they get a do-over for cheating.	https://t.co/hOlzsm6DuI

@LeviCurrie @midacre @Environment2022 @MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau I'm referring to the current trains and their current fuel cells. Do you know how they're made? That's a serious question.
@LeviCurrie @midacre @Environment2022 @MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau Do you have more information on how they're making the fuel cells for these trains? My understanding is that the standard method for generating industrial-use hydrogen is by steam methane reforming, because ectrolysis requires much more energy and is currently cost-prohibitive.
@TeslaSonic @kyanited @MikeHudema And depending on the extraction method, it can create CO2 and CO byproducts. They're really overselling this, imho. The train itself has clean emissions. But most of the current methods for producing hydrogen fuel cells are far from carbon neutral.
@LeviCurrie @midacre @Environment2022 @MikeHudema @JustinTrudeau Do you know how they're extracting the hydrogen to make the fuel cells? The most common method extracts hydrogen from natural gas, and that generates CO2 and CO byproducts. So even if you power the process using renewable energy, you still have to deal with the carbon emissions.

🚩PSA for #Resistance:		When you "quote-tweet" someone (= RT w/ comment), Twitter counts that as a "LIKE"! 		Result: if you quote-tweet a MAGA, this adds to their "likes". It also pushes their tweet to your followers' "home" feeds - where Twitter labels it as "Liked by [you]". 😕

@TheTawniest @Ange_Amene @GMSarli Yup. I don't know if it's a new "feature", but I saw it happening a LOT as of a few weeks ago. After asking around, figured out it's from quote tweeting.

@Graceerskine4 @owillis "Back in the day" public school teachers never had to pay their own insurance premiums. The state covered all of it. States could still do that, if they actually bothered to make schools and teachers (and education in general) a priority.
@xdelmar59 @babyspittle @owillis Actually, many estimates show sigle-payer *could* save a significant amount on total health care costs. The caveat is that the direct/indirect costs to implement are significant. Also any UH model would need to factor in (and mitigate) the impact on economy &amp; unemployment rates.
@Theon_Orbis First this one I just started with a basic search for "Cusack". Then I saw some Tweets with "James Woods" and "Rob Lowe" and tried each of those to the "Cusack" search.		Pro tip: you can also do a semi advanced search manually, using Boolean search terms.	https://t.co/Gbp2BtTJiN
