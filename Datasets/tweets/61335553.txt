@theweeknd God, sometimes my spirit my soul says the nuns are doing sale of satan almost. I have been practicing purity and you're my black ops. I'm silver Evergreen ops. Been here many times and not sure where Catholicism is going. He says he wants to die here,he's not doing God
@theweeknd I am the hero the American Spirit. I gave myself communion and ever since doing circles to fix their tabernacle back I have realized he has appeared in my life like a stalker. He says he's royalty heaven when he's winning, Royalty Satan when not! He's from the haulocas
@theweeknd They had me banned from the adoration chapel! Same priest I saw in the haulocast that had sales of satan, sale of lucifernum, and sales of Lucifer. And sale of Lillith. There's barely anybody driving down these streets and Topeka, Kansas has been a ghost town since him
@theweeknd that antichrist circuit is running communion at mph. https://t.co/5w9xDe4RVU. one day I received communion from a man called Fr.Carl and he black damned it for everybody that day and the pope accepted a sale of satan this time around, Sir. It was either I did or not 1c

@Drake God's Plan!
@Drake so straight up their just vampires. Like how the priests and nuns need to not have children so men and women can have or not have children. Their magick doesn't make sense. They would instantly know if they were a priest or not and there would be no molestation if it was.
@drake I intentionally brought the priest money to pay for Communion and he actually cursed it to hell. When I received it everyone was looking at each other weird like "did it work." I got my soul uninverted and the only thing their doing is cursing it up Circe said.
@drake pretty sure Catholics are vampires that did the Marty's spells and I actually remember it in my backyard it's actually a cult of vampires.
@drake Converting to Judaism. Pretty sure Catholicism after giving myself communion by the intercession of Heaven gave me the knowledge that the communion actually doesn't work. It's basically dyslexia backwards it's like a dictionary with half of it cut off and it inverted.
