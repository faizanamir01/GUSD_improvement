@brucedaley What
Oh ya and “don’t call your mother for a week, cut off communication with the rest of the world... Cept the internet and only during exports”
Sometimes, when I’m really trying to push myself on a video edit, I’ll give myself these really restrictive goals. “You can’t eat until you get through V1.” - “You can pee only during exports.” - “You must ignore time of day and forget sunshine. This 3 minute video owns you now.”

@Wd91178 Those “ignorant thoughts” are what I am referencing. :) Be aware of your inner most voice and beating yourself up in your own mind because these can be damaging, sometimes even when we are unaware.
You’ve got to listen to what you’re saying to yourself, you’re going to hear yourself either way.

@Lovckye Tell her to try. If she doesn’t reach out to twitter herself, there’s nothing I can do either. She needs to try.
@Lovckye It’s sweet that you’re trying to help but they’ll never give u her password. She needs to do this one.
@Lovckye She needs to be the one to email them
@Lovckye And I’m sure there’s some help line contact email on twitter communication page🛸 tell her to reach out there
@Lovckye Maybe start a brand new Twitter
@Lovckye Tell her to go through the normal steps to redo password. I assume she can get into her email right? If so, she can just reset everything.

@farmer_louigi @YouTube From my understanding “modifying guns” covers taking guns apart and putting them back together which is required for cleaning of many guns. Some even to safely reload. If you have other information, please share! I hope I’m misunderstanding
Yo I’m all about gun control and mental health background checks and a lot of other safety measures but @YouTube ... dude.. not a smart move. What if I wanna yt how to SAFELY clean a gun? Come on dudes. Come on. This move could make it all worse. Don’t take away safety measures.

@RunawayRick @thoughtsbeerkeg @B_Sigal I hate it when I miss a thoughtful conversation. Good talk all around guys.
@B_Sigal @thoughtsbeerkeg And there are rules and regulations around smoking. So you prove the point with your counter point. In California, you have to be 21 to buy a pack of cigarettes. I mean we could go on and on comparing laws, point is you made mine. ;)
@B_Sigal @thoughtsbeerkeg And some individuals aren’t capable of operating such materials, therefor rules and regulations are put in place to make sure only those suitable to operate said materials can acquire said materials. So, yea, individual, and also, common sense gun laws.

Tell me WHY a civilian would NEED an AR-15.
@PG_Sycak Yup. Don’t care. Enough of the general public refer to these weapons as “assault rifles” that my statement and outrage still stands.
@pfoeller Honestly yes learned this but also enough people call it that, that I honestly don’t give af that I’m technically wrong about the name. AR-15s ARE referred to across the board as “assault rifles” and my outrage stands

What is REALLY going on?
@yeor2002 @realDonaldTrump Both. But directly to trump since I was replying to his tweet and kim jong.. doesn’t have Twitter? What’s his deal w that? Does he get twitter reports?
@realDonaldTrump There are people starving in your own nation... maybe put your attention there instead of teasing ‘end of the world’ pride games with other world leaders. If either of you are right, we are all dead and there is no one left to applaud. What is there in that to brag about?
@PMasalsky @LoganPaul Maybe a lot of “yes” people? I hope they all have genuinely learned from their mistake or at least start to evaluate/gain self awareness/grow spines/whatever they’re lacking that lead to this.
@PMasalsky @LoganPaul (And got away from said shit heads..) but that’s besides the point.
@PMasalsky @LoganPaul One can hope. Though, 1st hand experience, I’ve worked with some shit heads &amp; I’m not a shit head. (Or at least do my best not to be). This was SO obviously not a good thing to do, &amp; there are 5-7 other people in his video? Is it fear of him that stops the others from saying no?
@LoganPaul Contd- ultimately YES obviously hold Logan responsible. But unless everyone on his team is brain dead, this was avoidable. Be better than this. This was SO 2017 of @LoganPaul and his team. 🙄
I’ve worked with all levels of YouTubers, the big ones have teams. @LoganPaul has a whole team of people around him, how did no one say “uh dude... maybe we shouldn’t post this.” One idiot is not surprising, a whole team tho? Come on guys... ONE of you is better than this.

@MePH____ @realDonaldTrump Watch the video I post today, and also, have you skimmed my timeline? “Start” implies I’ve done nothing constructive already.
@MePH____ @realDonaldTrump And how can you say to not attack a personality but call him “lord and savior” in your own bio.
@MePH____ @realDonaldTrump And for someone that lives in another country, you shouldn’t be telling US citizens to stay out of politics.
@MePH____ @realDonaldTrump And I agree about the “us vs them” mentality being dangerous and damaging. Watch the video I upload today to see my type of activism.

@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump It is our president who should b able to de-muddy things a bit, have a conversation, instead of condemn free speech. At least, I wish. 🤷🏼‍♀️
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump :) ❤️🌻
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump Yea, exactly. I wish the conversation weren’t so muddied with the president focused on condemning free speech.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump I will say I have enjoyed this civil discourse with you Eric :) thank u for having a conversation about free speech!
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump But again, this all goes back to my original point of why isn’t the president discussing WHY they are bending the knee in the first place
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump Upholding a value this country was founded on during our national anthem is very clearly anything but disrespectful.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump So practicing the first amendment is disrespecting our national anthem? Doesn’t that seem backwards to you?
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump I commend the players for using their platform to celebrate the first amendment thru protest. To me, this upholds the values of our country.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump By stating their practice of free speech is disrespecting the flag, I would 100% say that is a comment against free speech
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump The only reason we aren’t discussing police brutality rn is because the president of our country is speaking out AGAINST the 1st amendment.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump through out history people have walked out of work in protest. Students walk out of schools in protest. Speak where u will be heard.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump This is active practice of the first amendment and WHERE they choose to practice the right to free speech is their choice.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump In fact people DO walk out of work to show protest. Many times through our history. The field is where they will be heard. Clearly.
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump Crazy thought but maybe a football player on a football field IS their time. Though glad to hear u support the 1st amendment (somewhat).
@lastwolflord @realDonaldTrump (Your earlier response made u seem misinformed). With your logic, what is trumps job &amp; is he doing it by refusing the right to free speech?
@ericjv74 @realDonaldTrump The players chose to protest on the field. like students walking out of school to protest rescinding Daca. We voice where it will be heard.
@lastwolflord @realDonaldTrump You may be misinformed. That’s okay! This is why conversation is important! Police brutality is the original reason they kneel.
@realDonaldTrump Why not talk about what lead to the players taking a knee in the first place?

Having conversations with people you disagree with, and being willing to hear them out, is a vital piece of democracy.

@pdragoo I followed you bc I hope to have more conversations across the aisle with you! :) I find these conversations vital to democracy.

@Oasis00000 @MelindaStJohn @DonnaSusan66 @realDonaldTrump I feel no backlash nor do I approve of what #kathygriffin did. Thanks for adding your insight to the conversation! Have a good day! :)
@RoxFox2821 @realDonaldTrump If I am not the president and have better things to do, than he for SURE does hahaha thanks for proving my point :)
@pdragoo @realDonaldTrump You are literally doing the same thing right now, Pam. HaHa. We r all here so throwing stones won't help the conversation.
@joewoerman @realDonaldTrump I would just like him to focus on his job. Pretty simple actually. And thanks for assuming my motivation without asking me. ☺️

@thejohncarle JC it's EVERYONE! People whose content I love and trust are putting up BS titles that lead to nothing. I blame YouTube but!
@JeOughton and make you not trust the creator right?!? At least that's me.. hard to trust amplified titles ..
Welcome to my first twitter rant.
Like I get it.. @YouTube algo is kinda effed but seriously we don't have to aggressively feed into it with clickbait irrelevant titles.
I scrolled through my YouTube home page &amp; it's nothing but super "catchy" titles that have NOTHING to do w/ the core of the video. Come.On.
