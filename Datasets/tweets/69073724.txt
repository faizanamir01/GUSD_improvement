We are asking individuals to avoid the North Gate area as Air Force Academy and off-base fire crews respond to the brush fire on Academy grounds. Outbound traffic is currently being re-routed to the South Gate.
Air Force Academy fire crews and off-base agencies are responding to a brush fire near the North Gate area on Academy grounds. No infrastructure is being threatened. We will provide an update as more information becomes available.
