A void in Syria at this time will leave the field to Russia, Iran, Assad, ISIS remnants, Al Nusra, and more. Not America’s friends.	Long term planning may have to begin now to meet the blowback down the line.
Important to recall the harsh criticism President Obama received for pulling out of Iraq too early, and then having to send back full US force when ISIS filled the void. It took 4 years to push them out of Mosul.
NATO and US allies praise Secretary Mattis and lament his departure.	He is considered a steady and highly experienced pair of hands.

@David_Cameron "We've got to be realistic," he said. "Sometimes we look at a country like Somalia… and the international community almost says, 'Right, we've got this great plan to turn you into Denmark, this model of democracy, in a very short period of time.' It's totally unrealistic." [3/6]

@andersoncooper @AC360 @arwaCNN The Syrian government did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the case, but has previously denied targeting journalists.
@andersoncooper @AC360 Lawyer Scott Glimore: "What [the defector] revealed was really that from the moment that Marie, Paul Conroy and other journalists -- @arwaCNN, Paul Wood from the BBC -- as they were arriving in Lebanon, there were intelligence sources tracking their movements."
@andersoncooper @AC360 According to unsealed court documents, a former Syrian agent turned defector says that the Assad regime "regularly monitored" TV broadcasts. A top intel official "wanted to learn their location and take the necessary measures to stop them from reporting," the defector said.
@andersoncooper @AC360 "If I could throw Assad in prison, that's what I would do," Cat Colvin told me. Short of that, she said, "I think that every penny I can get out of the Assad regime is less that they can spend on barrel bombs and chemical weapons."
