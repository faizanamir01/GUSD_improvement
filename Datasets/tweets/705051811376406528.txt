@washingtonpost Trash and human waste being left by so many that supposedly respect nature. 😂😂😂😂 Time for @realDonaldTrump to start selling off some of the millions of acres.
@washingtonpost So all these celebrities like @Alyssa_Milano can raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend an illegal alien but can't scrounge together a few people to pick up trash. Their social justice hypocrisy only goes so far.  Maybe @realDonaldTrump should start selling the parks.

@Alyssa_Milano Wait I thought breast feeding was not sexual.  How could offering assistance in a time consuming task be construed as sexual harassment?
@Alyssa_Milano How many mass shootings was a bump stock used in? Oh yeah 1.  And it probably resulted in fewer casualties as it makes the weapon less accurate.  Let's also ban hotels because that is where the bump stock shooter shot from.

@ajgmarietta @saintpeterclan @SenSchumer Climate change does not threaten the planet. This planet was here long before us and will be here long after us.
@ajgmarietta @SenSchumer How can you be sure it will continue to rise without being able to say exactly why and what steps will result in specific outcomes.
@ajgmarietta @SenSchumer And how will our changes truly impact the climate.  i.e. Today there are x# of carbon emitting vehicles on road, at current pop growth in 2040 will be y# if same rate purchased per ratio of emission free vehicles. This will have z effect.
@ajgmarietta @SenSchumer But why can't they graph this assessment out over annual increments. If the mean temp is going to rise over 81 years show me how and why.  Why is it rising now faster than in 1918, how much impact is from US and what is actual impact of larger populated countries i.e. China

@RepTedDeutch @marcorubio Do Democrats still believe @realDonaldTrump colluded with Russia to win 2016 election? If "yes" where is evidence (almost 2 years, Team Mueller, and thousands of tweets) If no why not admit went too far and just admit @HillaryClinton sucked as a candidate.
@ABC7NY He probably did it but this press conference taints any objectivity in jury selection.  The spokeswoman says the assault captured on camera, calls him a predator, and discloses part of the victim's statement and states the victim and accused have never met before.
@ABC7NY Does this country believe in innocent until proven guilty anymore?
