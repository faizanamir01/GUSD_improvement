@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus I agree. It's been a back n forth issue for 20 yrs. Studies debunked and new ones begin.
@USABrit4Trump @Account40171750 @steph93065 @EricHolthaus There is a problem Houston. ( for the next several generations).  Studies must continue. Earth is warming very slowly at .6c last 100 yrs. but projected to increase. What to do about it is the issue. As it warms, troubles with weather, sea temps etc.
Japan is using their methods. We view the smog and they are required to wear masks when outside. I don't think it's working out too well. More to come. And our earth temp has risen .6C over the last 100 yrs.
Now I have taken up the "global warming" issue. It's going to take some reading, so stay tuned. I did find that 20,000 scientists have rejected the 1977 Study from Japan and their methods to rectify it "will harm mankind, science and technology."

@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus No judgement here. And yes all the things you mention are true. We do have a problem Houston! More for after we are gone, but we have future generations to consider. More studies on the way. Thousands are working on this issue.
@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus The study in Kyoto, Japan 1977 was rejected by 20,000 scientists in the US. They say "yes the earth's temp is rising slightly and will continue into the next decade." BUT the method of reducing the greenhouse gasses significantly will be detrimental to life.

@Account40171750 @USABrit4Trump @steph93065 @EricHolthaus I studied science for 10 yrs. There is no backing for "climate change". No more than in the past 100 years. Not political at all. If all CO2 were erased it would cool the atmosphere by .004 degrees.  We have removed a ton of smog tho. japan is choking.

@JustGiorge @JDugudichi As a little kid I was forced into a strict Southern Baptist Church. Hell fire and damnation every single service. I moved on to other churches I didn't agree with. I finally decided I didn't need any "man" interpreting the Bible and telling me how to live.
