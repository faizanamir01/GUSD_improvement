@Lori85136760 @realDonaldTrump It’s hard to believe believe Hillary Clinton with her holy speeches , could be so corrupt, but it’s true, she is and was, I believe there are a lot of people in the Democrats involved in serious corruption, and will be exposed Nancy Chuck Bernie, the Feds. Are coming El Chapo ??
@rtenews I don’t think so Boris, at least this time the whole population knows what it’s about, and will be able to decide with all the facts available to them, this time if it’s a yes there will be no argument, good luck to all concerned, study the facts, leave the emotional side out
@OliverMcGee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @AOC @CoryBooker @BernieSanders @KamalaHarris Yes that’s about it, I only wished the maintenance guy had walked on after his escalator stopped, to see the look on the faces of the 2 Democrats, Daw.
@ChuckCallesto What an idiot Bernie should be sent to live in Venezuela that’s a cure for him, cure of what you may ask? , socialism

@RTEOne @nidunne Thank you 🙏
@stpetercarms @VicarOfDishley Someone will recognize him, that’s a good photo of him, for recognition
@yoakumgirl923 There wouldn’t be any point in contacting you Jim Acosta as you wouldn’t report the truth, and there’s no point in letting you report Fake News, you will report the fake news anyway

@JoJoVonda Bernie all the things you talk about giving to people,you’re party never deliver, Donald Trump has delivered vast amounts of jobs, cut down waste, doing his best to secure the border, against corruption on the Democrats side, Bernie you talk the talk, you cannot walk the walk
@yoakumgirl923 They never allowed for a Trump factor in their equation, all the wrong doing will be exposed, Democrats look out
@TerriBe59602687 @dl4gl @gaye_gallops @MsDeb3 And talk he will as he has nothing else to loose,  he will spend the rest of his life in prison, talking and spilling the beans will be a pastime for him,
@AshleyW838 @b77_sarah There will never be a Saunders administration, so no worries on that front, the Democrats May be Gaga not that Gaga
@ChiefPalmer @michaelbate23 @VancouverPD @BCLEMemorial @CPPOM Praise the lord for for their lives, heroism and serve may they be happy in the home of the Lord RIP
@dl4gl @TerriBe59602687 @gaye_gallops @MsDeb3 Nancy we know it’s a lot what do you do with all that money, give it to your family, give some to CNN, maybe some to Chuck???
@KokeReport @TerriBe59602687 @CNN @MSNBC @donlemon @maddow It’s amazing to see that black guy supporting the Democrats who were the slave owners, and started a war to keep their black slaves, Abraham Lincoln changed all that, pity no one told that guy ripping away the flag
@kjf1323 @DinoDiabolical Don’t worry they won’t after all they are Republicans,  the party of Law and order, the party who loves America the party who will secure the border 👍
@MiriamOCal @ClaireByrneLive Miriam it’s hard to believe how this could happen, it’s even to understand when one sees the photo of the children, god love them
@PhelanVicky Lovely photo Vicky thanks for sharing your wonderful moment with us Darragh is a very lucky lad to have you as a mum, Bless you and your family and good luck we are all praying for you 🙏❤️
@seanhannity Who would blame those who are probably bewildered at the idea he would actually run, the self admiration society is hard at work in Bernie’s head
@joyreaper @slacker_ga01 Dirty rotten bastard, sick, how can The Catholic Church stand by and let this happen and Accepted by idiot Bishops and Cardinals and why are there so many Pedophiles in the Catholic Church, it seems to be a haven for those creepy guys
@IrishTimesSport Get your stuff going guys we are all behind you
@RealJamesWoods @yoakumgirl923 Must be sad to go to bed every night and get up every morning knowing you are a most hateful person in politics, God is watching Nancy and you haven’t long before you meet him , what will your answer be??
@seanhannity @lolly7777 Bernie Saunders is one of the biggest frauds in American politics, someone said to him, you can’t talk, you can’t walk, you act stupid, you look awful, come on in you’ll make a good Democrat, he never had anything to offer and never did anything for America, a sponger yes
@IrishTimes Good idea as all the services are in place
@Kitcars88557088 @PatriotSally Maybe Nancy Pelosi has to die are there any heroes?
@gaye_gallops @PatriotSally Why would you think Nancy Pelosi would do anything to stop these gangs and drug traffickers, she is part of these cartels, this is where a huge amount of her money is coming from, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are silent Gang members, make no mistake,  put them in prison now
@DeepStateExpose @realDonaldTrump And will happen again in 2020
@DC_ARVSgt @Tim47222 @LeeJasper Well Sarg unfortunately it takes seven years to change every molecule in the human body, it may take that long, hopefully not, anger and bitterness shortens ones life
@Nigelrefowens Nigel no one would have a problem with that👍
@VMSportIE Well done Dan what a kick what an angle the vibration from Cardiff registered on the Richter scale 👍
@IrishTimesWorld I think it’s incredible that a religious organization like the Catholic Church has to be dragged to the bench, still will not admit their wrongs, the pope issues a guidebook to the bishops dealing with child sex abuse, that in itself is an admission there is a problem, shame you
@MichaelRingFG @MulrannyPark @thecontel @DeptRCD @MayoDotIE @mayoireland @MayoCoCo @EntenteFlorale @MulrannyCourt @MulrannyTourism @TourismMulranny Thank you Michael you’re a true champion for the west of Ireland 👍

@TeaBoots @jesse5216 Shame on you Judge Roberts where is your decency gone, if you ever had any, would your Mother and Father be proud of you now, when people do bad things, and are asked to explain themselves, they will answer, Look at what Judge Roberts did, corruption is wrong at any level
@MrKshus0711 @billyboblouise @realDonaldTrump And it is a powerful speech and what makes it all powerful is that it is the truth and it is factually incorrect, no fake news like one gets from Jim Acosta on CNN, whenever one hears a speech  delivered in that way it is easy to listen to, because factual evidence is available
@Bulldozzer61 @TriaRyder @cs00582scs @my6girls2012 Pull the state funding now, if the American tax payers find out they will riot, it’s hard to believe,but it’s true
@cezhere @matterberry1 @VaporKing @SwampysGhost @realDonaldTrump Amen 🙏 PDT.
@gailsline @Jetsta812 Ray j your an inspiration to all Black and White, every word you spoke was the beautiful truth, and god bless you to Sir,  thank goodness for people like you, good luck Sir
@toombstone @greensunset3 I like that from one champion to another, I think you made the President happy, thank you, well Done 👍🙏
@gailsline @Jetsta812 No lady Rose it’s about time the Catholic Bishops respect the will of the people, and face up to their wrong doings to, mother and baby homes, child sex scandals shame on them, the wrongs of the past are catching up on them
@13_cupcakes @perriganps @SpeakerPelosi How can Nancy Pelosi be speaker in the house, she can hardly string three words together, no one can understand what she’s saying,  she is completely incoherent, muttering sounds that are not in the English language, and suffering memory loss it’s time for someone to tell her:
@JanetTxBlessed @Jetsta812 And the blessings of the lords day to you also Janet, that’s a lively message to receive on the lords day bless you 🙏
@GIJoeOPS @greensunset3 That guy has to have a PhD in new word (idiotology)? what he has a PhD in have no idea, but I am sure his prof. Is wondering where he or she went wrong, he appears completely uneducated in any sense, even basic 8year olds stuff, he doesn’t seem to have reached abstract reasoning
@hersbadII @DinoDiabolical @realDonaldTrump 👍🙏
@backt0nature @sumner_faith Happy Birthday Arthur👍 🎁🎂
@GOPChairwoman @Biedaboo Which proves my point Bernie is an idiot, give more aid to a criminal regime well done Bernie at least you’re living up to your name and I don’t feel bad calling you an idiot, as you just proved my case thank you

@THETXEMBASSY @sxdoc @LisaMei62 Nancy Pelosi hasn’t a clue what she is talking about, she almost said George Bush, instead of George Washington, and if George Washington could see the mess Nancy and Chuck have created he would string the up by the neck, that poor thing should be in a nursing home in care
@inittowinit007 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @_America_First @PamB60 @SassyT_Joy @LoriinUtah @buzzman888 @MEL2AUSA @Sissy_USMC @lalaviealoha @PhilMcCrackin44 Thank goodness you’re the President Donald Trump you did more in your short time in office than other presidents did in the past 30 years, and you had to undo corruption waged on Americans in the Clinton/Obama periods, Buisness man with compassion, humanity loves America PDT 🙏👍
@DC_ARVSgt @TheSun @Peter_Kirkham The anti police idiots, just looking for any excuse to criticize the police, I hope the idiot who posted that @TheSun never needs the help of the police, the brainless fools probably has nothing better to do, so sad not to have a life
@PFEW_Chair @DC_ARVSgt The Judges who hand stupid judgmental decisions like this are now fit for purpose, and a given the wrong signals,it’s ok to assault a police officer we will only get a suspended sentence, wrong judgment, protect the police with stiffer prison time, they will think twice next time
@Trump454545 @slacker_ga01 Shame on you Jessie they say the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, you had a chance to make a decent life for yourself, you blew it man

@theGrandOldJAC @DinoDiabolical That’s the face of an idiot, who belongs to the self admiration society, and a face to grace a horror movie, have a look in the mirror Bernie, with your glasses on, what would you be able to deliver to the American people, you never did and you never will, Bye 👋 Bernie
@SuperEliteTexan @slacker_ga01 It’s time to use live rounds to protect yourself and your citizens, it will get out of control unless you do something drastic, take control of your borders or you don’t have a country
@RepDanCrenshaw @leslieh707 The people will always win, you only rule with consent, you only police by consent, some politicians forget this example, Uganda, South Africa, Iran,
@CGTNOfficial Delighted to see the Giant Panda 🐼 cubs are doing well 👍
@Trump454545 @slacker_ga01 Way to go, the time has come for the decent people to get together and fight back, remember you out number The Tugs thousands to one they will have nowhere to hide if they provoke you, and they know that 👍
@RealJack @billyboblouise There’s your answer, open your eyes before it’s to late, there is a new type of war being fought, wake up and smell the coffee, peoples emotions and minds are being manipulated, by false promises that will not and cannot be delivered, people who don’t have the skills fall victim
@JudicialWatch @rainwatercreek What else would you expect from a criminal drug dealer supported politician, Nancy you’re in trouble time to get away,  to where ? Maybe Ukraine? Bring Chuck with you
@DLoesch The boses should drop him,
@mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Jessie you can swear all you like, the damage is done face it like a man, a prisoner arrived in to start his sentence in prison, he protested to the other inmates, i am innocent of this crime, another inmate said son get used to it everyone in here is innocent, so Jessie God ?
@dbongino @ronandchardavis That’s what you get when idiot thugs are involved, not a Brain between them poor things,
@DAVIDJOHNWEBB3 @rainwatercreek @JudicialWatch Yes you are absolutely correct the Democrats seem dead set on destroying America, with their evil ways Drug cartels, People traffickers, allowing criminal gangs into the country, Fake News, Vote Rigging, political corruption, anti border security, they should be in prison,the lot

@rtenews Arlene it’s a big mistake for the UK to leave the EU, the EU has to change, the UK could help that change only sitting at the top table, if Uk leaves so should the Republic of Ireland, Good luck to all
@KamalaHarris Jessie has lost a lot of credibility as a result of this silly thing he did, I would say he’s sorry for allowing people to exploit him like that
@DC_ARVSgt Well Sarg that’s pretty powerful looking kit you have, hope you won’t have it, hopefully it will work as a deterrent,
@plantlady293 @PatriotSally Bernie Saunders is the living proof of stupidity, if people come to the USA legally in a decent way they’re welcome, Bernie is so stupid he cannot see that, he should be in a circus as an idiot on display, Bernie get yourself a rocking chair, sit on your porch humming to yourself
@Lamed_Vav Shame on you maybe shameful doesn’t bother you lot, it’s a way of life
@true_pundit @rjones8194 Yes you are correct Mr President one doesn’t see many people illegally trying to enter Venezuela or North Korea, socialism? I rest my case Judge
@BeckyBarrister @DC_ARVSgt Becky, that’s what police officers do on a daily basis, they are not given the credit and gratitude they deserve by the public at large, its nice to see your kind words of appreciation, they put themselves in all types of danger daily, I hope the Suicide person is ok bless you

@TexPatriotGirl @grgbkr37 President Obama was a criminal it’s all coming out now, it seems he hates America and would sell the Americans out, well he has plenty of places to go on holidays without costing him money, with the credit he has amassed in all those, criminal creating countries he financed shame
@TexPatriotGirl @grgbkr37 Brilliant answer, and think the Democrats want to destroy America and make it like Venezuela, ?? You will never see that happen, why ? The Republicans are watching over America and protecting you thanks to PDT 👍

@DC_ARVSgt Sarg when one looks at that bright cheerful young lad, and think what his mom and dad are going through, ones heart bleeds for, them that piece of nothing who caused his death should get life in prison, I hoped is haunted by the young lads face for the rest of his miserable life
@daraobriain When one looks at the earth from the space station it looks fantastic but fragile,this plant is our home, and it has limited resources to sustain our lives, and it has a capacity which we are rapidly reaching, there are far to many people on the planet at the moment, take care 👍
@BobBrinson1 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nancy Pelosi is a foolish dimwit, she will challenge the President in what court, I don’t believe she realizes who the Judges are poor thing, that is proof of her stupidity, it’s not fair to her to be working, she should be in a nursing home,
@SimonHarrisTD Thank you Simon bless you 🙏

@RealJamesWoods @WK266 Shame on you Bill both you and your wife are monsters, cheating, stealing from the people of Haiti how do you expect to meet your maker you are a disgrace, but then your a Democrat, that’s one reason, where is your humanity Bill
@MOReganIT Thugs with nothing to do
@RyanAFournier Maxine Waters name is an otherwise name for disaster, Maxine your an embarrassment to your friends, go hide somewhere
@WayneDupreeShow President Trump can take Nancy and Chucks share of El Chapo  billions to build the wall, they probably have a new cartel drug supplier, to replace El Chapo
@inittowinit007 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RealJamesWoods It’s to late now we all know, should have done it before they let the cat out of the bag
@IrishTimesWorld Spanish are you mad, you have enough on your plate to worry about without creating more problems for your self, and the British bring billions of euro to your economy every year,
@tomhappens Yes Tom I would agree with that you know the dogs message to visitors to his home, remember this is my home your a visitor, to you I’m just a Dog, you are going after your visit, I live here and they love me, signed Dog
@jasoninthehouse Then get the FBI guy to back you, I didn’t think so, you’re on your own buddy, and classified won’t get you of the hook, when you dig a hole for yourself, stop digging no one is going to pay you they are all being found out, and running for cover
@mitchellvii The idiot doesn’t know her own name, can no one see Nancy Pelosi is in poor health, mentally and physically, I don’t believe she knows what she is doing or saying or what day of the week it is, one cannot have people like her in government it’s to dangerous, imagine thanksgiving
@SimonHarrisTD Well Done Simon you’re having a hard time with things not of your making, we the FG cores supporting you 👍
@raphaellaN @BreitbartNews So why didn’t you do it ?
@DC_ARVSgt What a shame someone needs a kick up the proverbial,to knock some sense into those in control of the public purses, and wake up before it’s to late, it takes time to train police officers, it’s not like a factory who needs 500 workers advertise and there they are, good luck Sarg
@Marlor18 @CollegeFix Sorry Mary my teacher told me always read the entire question before you give your answer, I only red part of the article, which gave me a different story 👊 my apologies to anyone I may have offended or given the wrong idea bless you Prof. and bless President Donald Trump 🙏

@Lance_Hunter_ @esme35975435 I believe we will have to have a look at you Jim very suspicious, be careful, El Chapo is naming people??
@sxdoc @HarleyRace2 I have been telling you this for years why else would Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer be so against the wall, it’s down to the old reliables, cause and effect, they get the money, now they have to earn it, Nancy and Chuck you will not be allowed to earn it, So prison guys 👍
@DC_ARVSgt Yes Sarg and there are lots of jobs older guys could do like driving and moving barriers paperwork in the station and let the young bloods out do the more physical stuff, either way the police force needs to be increased by at least 25% the MP who does that would be elected no ??
@ancienthiker @DC_ARVSgt Well the government hasn’t put in much extra money really, as the extra money only took care of rising costs, there was very little to improve  or expand the service, law and order is the most important element in the country, there should never be a money problems in policing
@DC_ARVSgt Sarg some years ago whilst playing a rugby match against Barry police in Cardiff we met some retired officers who came back to serve as consultants, they had their pension and were paid as well, that seemed a good idea especially for forensic and technical skilled officers 👍

@SocialismStench @ronandchardavis @tedcruz Well done law enforcement and courts of justice, that will pay for the wall,  what will Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer do for money now that El Chapo is gone, I suppose they have another El Chapo
@DIDNOTVOTEFOR44 @sxdoc Probably well see

@logicalpoIitics @blingarama @thehill @HillTVLive Democrats are both, definitely stupid and habitual liars, just look at the faces of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer they are blank there is no sincerity in their faces, poor things, not having communication skills is a handicap for any anyone let alone a politician
@GA_peach3102 @yoakumgirl923 @LadyQanuck Yes the President will get the wall constructed bless him, Americans get in and support your President there are a lot of selfish, criminals disguised as Democrats trying to destroy the USA 🇺🇸 be careful you don’t create a Venezuela in America then you’ll be sorry
@Trump454545 @yoakumgirl923 You’re preaching one thing and you are the one who is creating hatred and you’re words are dividing not bringing togetherness,  I have yet to see an ounce of respect to anyone you’re preaching radical ideas, to create unrest shameful way to live, maybe you know no better pity,
@native_aztec Good on you bless you 🙏
@J_TrumpIN @blingarama I absolutely agree with you President Donald is the best President the USA 🇺🇸 has had in a very long time, he cares about the people he loves America, it would be nice to believe he was sent by the lord God himself to save America God Bless and protect him🙏
@statesperson @EversFam Jim Acosta you can put whatever slanted views you like on the border problem, the facts are there, there is a border problem, you hate the President more than you love your country, it’s an age old equation, you need balance in your reporting, and stop using false and fake news
@Independent_ie Hopefully you will try again sorry for your disappointment I’m sure you did the right thing withdrawing as you did, live to fight another time 👍
@Rog_Anderson @IrishAir_ @JoeEDwyer @MaryLouMcDonald @GMB I agree with you where is the famous fighting spirit of the Scottish, like the battle of Sterling, and others
@DeepStateExpose Send them to Afghanistan

@DecapuaSara @SL1733 @perriganps Yes when one has a potty mouth like she has then I have no problem stating what I stated, well brought up decent folk do not speak the way she speaks , if you conduct yourself like a gutter rat expect to be treated that way, Isaac Newton’s third law of relativity, and Karma 🤜
@Bluepopcorn8 @AskeaPhyllis She couldn’t have a boyfriend well maybe, but I believe she is a man she looks so masculine
@marklevinshow @gforrest47 Send him to jail
@Trump454545 @WHwttP1 There is a word ( you insufferable old hag ) now that’s a fitting description for a witch
@TrumpOrBust2020 @perriganps @SpeakerPelosi Get off you horrible idiot you’re frightening the children
@Education4Libs @leslieh707 Because you are an idiot go back to school and get retrained, it’s never to late, there are people who can help you, you will probably break down and cry, however after that you will start to get strong and become a man, you’ll see give it a go
@RealKyleMorris @gforrest47 And yet again Jim Acosta proves the fact he is an idiot, his family must be very embarrassed to be related to him I am sure his children, if he has any ( he doesn’t look like he’d be up to it) must get slagged at school about their stupid Dad, Jim you should think of your family
@IrishTimesWorld I agree with you let’s go get it

@seanhannity Well done President Donald Trump you’re the greatest, now you can build the wall 👍🙏👊
@hredriders Yes Serena Nancy is to stupid to notice, and no one in the USA is that brave or stupid to interfere with the gun laws
@seanhannity Jim Acosta is an idiot, some people look ok but are idiots, in Jim Acosta’s case he actually is en idiot and looks like an idiot, so he is not out of place except except when he goes to the White House, he should stay in the home town where he is the official town idiot go back
@RyanAFournier Go and do a bit of work you’re wasting space that could be used by decent people, if I was as disliked as you Nancy Pelosi I would hide and never come out
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS Come on PDT build that wall
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I absolutely agree 100% Laura, the lies the cheating the scandals created the false and fake news, hit those scoundrels in the pocket where it hurts 👍

@raymysterio305 @Hellrazor1776 @CNN CNN has absolutely no credibility in news circles 90% or what they report is fake, they must have a team of full time fiction writers, they would be better off working for Walt Disney where that stuff is excepted 😡

@DC_ARVSgt The police cannot be blamed, the culprits brought before the court by the police, its the Justice system that let the police officers and society down, the Judges will have to be given guidelines on mandatory sentencing where there is loss of life, it is 2nd degree murder, 10 yrs
@dbongino Socialism is a magnet for idiots and downbeats, who are exploited by scoundrel politicians who promise them things that they can’t deliver or don’t deliver, keeping where they are with no escape, they are enslaved, enter Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, need i say more, shame

@DeplorableJuJuV @BPPope @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @GenFlynn Put that one down to Nancy Pelosi I saw her party workers recruiting and helping illegal migrants to register to vote using false ID
@Maggieb1B @TnDonahue @POTUS @JohnnyB371 @IWasHrren @Dawn_DeMore1 @RNRKentucky @junogsp7 @LisaSmith4680 @ArchKennedy @superyayadize @speakrofhouse Yes I agree when socialism when infiltrated by criminal elements is a very bad thing especially when you have mindless Moran’s like Nancy Pelosi at its core, and a puppy like Chuck Schumer with no backbone beside her, a recopy for disaster, Bless President Donald Trump thank you
@SixNationsRugby @IrishRugby Yes Johnny I lost my voice that moment, my vocal chords could not take the strain, I think the vibration of the supporters cheers was measured on the rector scale, combined with near heart attack, as the cry’s, its spinning, its spinning and then it was there, you were airborne

@Counselor70 @ChucksWife1973 @ThereseOSulliv2 It’s a well known fact Jim Acosta is a joke and laughing talk figure in media circles, he wouldn’t know the truth if it bites him on the nose, he is a fictional character, not real

@emsie76 @HipsterCoffeeCo @BillOReilly @UghToHillary Yes that’s what it’s called, there were more battles won with strategy then with brut force, o yes you still need the brutal elements as well, mostly the other side never seems the strategical elements until it’s to late, to effectively deploy or reply
@BillOReilly @UghToHillary Nancy Pelosi won nothing she cannot see the trap the Presidents setting for her great stuff Mr President

@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Yes the President will get the wall constructed because he cares for the safety of his people, and that’s the bottom line, God bless President Trump keep him safe and well,
@DescioseJanice Nancy Pelosi is totally gone off the rails, she cannot put two words together, slurred speech, forgetting lines, she is acting like a stagestruck five year old, can now-one see she is not fit for purpose, she should be in a hospital, getting mentally assessed poor thing,
@DioceseofConnor Congratulations Mrs Holman I would like to wish you a very happy 104th birthday 🎂 praise the lord for your long life, don’t stay up to late celebrating good luck
@bigleaguepol @TriaRyder Well done 👍 President Trump, what ever it takes build the wall protect the people, I read an article that stated Nancy Pelosi is the most unpopular politician in the country for years so how did she get elected? Beats me
@SenatorBennet @realDonaldTrump You are a fool you don’t give a dam about the ranchers and farmers, build the dam wall and protect the people

@GovMikeHuckabee @mike_peinsipp @SebGorka Jim Acosta is a noted idiot most journalists laugh at him, and see him as a joke figure, and not someone to take seriously, he should be writing fiction, it’s about all he is good for
@realDonaldTrump Yes I agree you make Dad smile fair play to you DT JR.
@DubFireBrigade Well done guys 👍
@rtenews @campaignforleo That guy didn’t even know who the Taoiseach is, and then he voiced an opinion about Government, poor chap shouldn’t be allowed out on his own without a minder
@DC_ARVSgt Well done police 👍
@UlsterRugby @ChampionsCup Yes guys Quarter-finals 👍
@TommyBowe14 Yes Tommy good stuff good luck guys
@seanhannity You say Pelosi should negotiate can’t you see she is almost senile, she has lost the ability to make herself understood, when you look at her face and one sees that vacant look of bewilderment, the government is far to important to have someone like her as speake, Nancy please 🎬
@donnabrazile I didn’t think Nancy Pelosi would a problem with security hasn’t she all her criminal subversive friends out there to protect her, what I cannot understand is, what is she going out there for, or what possible Buisness has she, she’s getting it hard enough to communicate at home,
@DeltonDunn @KeepNitreeel @JackPosobiec Here Here God Bless President Trump keep him safe and well, to save America and make America great again, and stop those Democrats tearing it apart,
@MrWyattEarpLA @UghToHillary CNN are insane fake news, misreporting the truth, to support their fake news, what a bunch of Dimwits,
@RealSaavedra @PatriotSally Yes that’s a man with a head on his shoulders, that has a functioning brain making absolute sense of everything he said, I wish more people like him would step up to the plate, God Bless You 🙏
@DonaldJTrumpJr @PatriotSally @realDonaldTrump Well said Junior chip of the old block go for it, you would make a fantastic President, imagine Trumps Whitehouse for 16 years 👍🙏
@ScottAdamsSays @TriaRyder There is no doubt about that, the Democrats have been receiving drug trafficking money for years, including Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, anyone with an eye and ear on their heads will know that, why do you think they are fighting the wall ?,they have no shame or morals!
@KAG4All @PatriotSally @Trump454545 @plantlady293 @LVNancy @_IamAnita_D @cjlovesamerica @Rise1Soar2BFree @USAloveGOD @PhilMcCrackin44 Because that’s Democrats corruption at work, thankfully they are being exposed, and they will pay for their wrongs, believe me
@jojoh888 @Ms_lol_tweets What’s wrong with that woman she is not making any sense, she is sluggish in her speech, acting like a stroke victim or possibly mental problems, it’s not fair to have her at the head of government, repeating herself over and over again, fumbling with her notes, please step down
@winknews @Ms_lol_tweets I do not know what Nancy Pelosi was going to visit the troops for, she couldn’t care less about them, or maybe she was going to recruit some terrorist to bring back to the USA, or maybe she is a weapon of destruction just being there who knows
@Nigelrefowens Nigel you’re correct let’s get you in there and clean that mess up, I think you would make a good speaker, with the ability, bring order to the house
@_LoveLike_JESUS AMEN 🙏
@Brian_P14 @TonyDunlap17 @GayRepublicSwag Oprah I am surprised at you the Democrats where the slave owners, do you know nothing about the civil war, the Republicans fought a war under Abraham Lincoln to free the slaves, you’r not giving him or your fellow black who gave their lives to free the country from slavery,
@UppityWilliamP @UghToHillary I hope that bastard throwing the punches has been arrested charged and got a custodial prison sentence, and put into a rehabilitation center, as he has proven to be nothing short of an wild thug animal ,
@AppSame @rwaller73 @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Get on with it you idiots, in gods name try and not look so stupid,
@cathyholton4 @KathrynKemm That woman is sowing the seeds of disaster for her self and the people she represents, civil war will be the result like what happened in Germany under Hitler, her people will be wiped out, a country is governed by consent push people to far, they will retaliate, it’s happening
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Mr President those two couldn’t organize a booze party in a brewery when one looks into their eyes 👀 there seems to be no one home, it’s like looking into the abyss, they both look like they’re lost, poor things, if they are not up to the job they should resign or step aside
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @reddit @JudicialWatch This will not end well for the FBI,  the dirty people working there will need to watch their backs, this will not end well for them, they will be exposed they need to think,  what then ?? And they have to ask, is it worth it
@realDonaldTrump Here Here for the President security and the safety of the citizens come first,
@HillaryClinton Yes but you Democrat’s don’t care you’re causing it
@Lrihendry @JanetteValenti9 @realDonaldTrump O yes we are
@rspm1230 Excuse the language, but people regurgitate better material than what she is made of, I pray to god almighty to protect the children of America from that thing, she is a hate figure without substance, how can anyone be so twisted and mentally unbalanced and get elected?
@charliekirk11 What a great idea, the problem is the Democrats will not back this as the illegal criminal elements are the ones who vote for them, most of their power bases are in the criminal world I saw film of a democrat activist stopping illegal migrants and showing them how to register
@NBCNews Brilliant now Democrats match that 20 million $ someone cares God Bless America and its citizens
@DelphicOracal1 @Clark2June You’re absolutely correct he is such a dimwit he didn’t realize he was making a case for President Trump, that the wall works and proved so by stating how tranquil it was where a wall existed, however I don’t think he got much sleep that night, his Brain  lags behind his mouth
@SarahPalinUSA @StoltzfusTonya You said it was a poetic excuse, for not building the wall, you have to realize you are dealing with two poetic people in Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi poor things never grew up
@leinsterrugby @Ross__Byrne Yes that was the move to get the adrenaline moving good stuff job done 👍
@AWilkinson267 Reverend I was once told by a Wexford man, that if you come from Wexford you needed a special license to live in Cork, good luck and happy new year to you, a well you are special

@DC_ARVSgt Yes Sarg I agree there are plenty of jobs to be done, if they fail to complete the tasks add on extra time failing, that send them back to her majesty’s boarding school with high wells 👍
@NitrobBear @obrechtmr @SenFeinstein @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi There has to be a way of getting that terrorizing woman out of office, she insults the citizens of the USA 🇺🇸 she stated the illegal criminal migrants are more American than the people already living there who built the greatest nation in the world, shame knows no bounds
@poncepete @charliekirk11 @Acosta @realDonaldTrump I don’t think he knows what he did he better stick to his day job in the circuit clowning well I have to admit he is doing a good job for  President Trump on the wall with his promotion film in supporting the wall by showing how tranquil lives are where there is a wall thank you
@charliekirk11 @Acosta @realDonaldTrump It’s hard to believe that a circus clown disguised as Jim Acosta claiming to be a CNN reporter could be so stupid to think we wouldn’t notice, the reason there are no migrants there is there is a wall, DAW, although you are a clown you have proved the Presidents wall works
@senatemajldr It’s important that the facts are demonstrated to all concerned the way senator McConnell did,  and its also important to demonstrate fraudulent criminal mental attitude of the Democrats playing politics with peoples safety and security, shame on them they have to meet the lord
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Well Done Tom without you and Judicial Watch all this would be swiped away and Justice lost, and that a serious crime, the Judges who oppose you also need investigating what are they hiding and why ?? Good luck Bless you 🙏
@SaraCarterDC @Acosta Jim Acosta you’re an idiot you’re a fake news reporter, everything you report has to be treated as fake, I bet if you went to Afghanistan you would pick a spot and claim, look there is no war going on here I don’t know what all the fuss is about, you are a disgrace shame on you
@ShannonAirport @Munsterrugby Good luck guys
@realDonaldTrump Well done Mr President your an inspiration and you stand with the people who put their lives on the line the security personnel need all the help they can get from Congress and Government, it’s a pity there are so many Numb Sculls elected to office and cannot do the job
@Nigelrefowens @Jbeardmore Nigel you better bring those guys for a IQ test,
@WhiteHouse Democrats the President is doing his job to protect and secure the citizens now you do yours, Build the wall now
@Nigelrefowens @WelshRugbyUnion @welshpremrugby Hard men Nigel , you will need all your diplomatic and refereeing skills at that one, cheers mate 👍
@seanhannity Well Done Me President even CNN are supporting the wall, wow 😮, Nancy Pelosi looks like she is in shock, a well she always looks like that, can someone find a job for her to occupy her time and stop her terrifying the citizens of the country, please,
@starcrosswolf @TenquidOk @AOC That’s pure hate on legs she is sub human, she sees the open border as an open door for her illegal criminal friends to come in, I have never witnessed such a potty foul mouth or what way was she brought up, by what kind of parents, they must be ashamed of her,
@bethtcoast @Heywood98 What do you mean they look like evil, they are evil, and when one is evil it manifests itself in the face, hence the evil look, it’s a proven fact
@Lindalu827 @Marlor18 I absolutely agree with you
@MakeUSAGreat5 @Ms_lol_tweets Yes you said it all keep the pressure on the Democratic Idiots who are the cause of the government shutdown, and they like to blame someone else no ones believing you DMs
@RealSaavedra @PeterCRoberts45 Most of them don’t know how to answer a question, they are programmed only to ask, that is as far as their brains can reach poor things
@RichardTBurnett @TriaRyder You are a terrorist partly in disguise in a country, where you are allowed to talk like that, the countries you represent are not in the USA,  why don’t you go there and see how we’ll you get on
@PJeannieM @MissyJo79 I do not believe millions of Americans voted for those fools, I would say illegal migrants voted for them, imported through the southern border by the Democrats
@firstcontactnow @lilBee67569241 Dumb and Dumber in what ever order you wish
@SteveDaines @ReubenHarris205 @POTUS Stevie decent people like you is what made America great, the President is another decent and  great man who is standing up to the criminal elements intrenched in the Democrat party, and presided over by, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer, shame on them,
@UlsterRugby Well done guys mighty men thank you
@ACTBrigitte In the past witches were burned at the stake, how does one deal with them now ? Just wondering,
@ACTBrigitte Stick with it Mr President the country is behind you 🤜👍🎆
@carolecadwalla Carole if you’re lost for words I am getting worried, it’s all a mess no one thought this thing out in advance, that’s the problem
@martylyricfm Larry you’re an icon good luck in Golden, 40 years my god where did it go thank you,  Larry you and Florey were a great team and the amazing thing you always sounded the same Bless you keep well
@NBCNews You should apologize for being your, you are a disgrace to humanity, you’re gutter mouth has no place in society, decent people don’t talk like that, you should go to a facility and learn some manners, or maybe you like being an ugly girl, ?
@tomhappens Tom trying to extend the festivities for as long as possible who can blame one cheers 🥂
@Pink_About_it @TangoGSierra The fake news media has always been the enemy of the people, as I stated the Haters Creators of Rumor Spread by Fools and Accepted by Idiots, and that’s a fact, politicians play on these facts for ever, what a shame
@usminority @TangoGSierra The American people are all in agreement with the President on the border security plan, even Chuck and Nancy agree we have all witnessed their speeches stating so what has changed? Their hate for the success of the President and the facts that he has exposed their criminality
@pvtjokerus The Presidents man won that debate and so say all of us 💪👍
@Nigelrefowens Not a chance Nigel you’re going to be immortal, trust me, cheers 🍻 mate 👍
@sssnakeplissken @WhatTheFFacts That young chaps got good taste I can see it in his face, or is it curiosity and you know what killed the cat
@RealCandaceO @UghToHillary @AOC stupidity knows no bounds lady, the President is not lying about illegal migrants, you lady are confusing immigrants with illegal migrants as usual the President has no problem with immigration as that is documented  and securitized and legal, thousands of criminal migrants no no
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews Well government workers go after Chuck and Nancy it’s their fault
@JackPosobiec @Turk182_JCP I told you it was coming, there will be more you know Isaac Newton’s 3rd law of relativity, waiting for the reaction, praise the lord for for that man hope he will be ok
@standfortruth10 @MissyJo79 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The Democrats Do Not Care the people will have to stand tall, what stupid people like the Democrats don’t realize a country is governed and policed by consent, take that away what then, anarchy, push the people to far, Nancy And Chuck you will regret it
@ACTBrigitte @jules618790 That’s correct they will run out of illegal and ineligible voters to keep their farcical corrupt criminals party in government, George Washington and the founding fathers will not be resting peacefully, with the ongoing civil mess the Democrats have cast on their legacy shameful
@pborch Run her out of town now that’s trouble in the making, she is also unconstitutional because of her threats to the security of the nation
@RealBasedMAGA @Zwoodbutcher General Keene its people of your caliber who has Earned and Deserves the respect of the nation, that the stupid political people should listen to, you are the security expert here, and what you stated is common sense, how does one make them listenLord Bless you General  thank you
@robertinreydon @Femi_Sorry @s_peplow This type of harassment should not be allowed in any country the police should be able to detain these thugs that is not peaceful protest, I am not siding either way I am only referring to the bullying thuggish behavior not acceptable on British streets
@MikeStuchbery_ @EUflagmafia @dunc_saboteur That foul mouth should be locked up in a mental facility, he is the one who is not British, decent British people don’t act like that
@DC_ARVSgt Dogs are fantastic they give everything and demand nothing except they want your company and love that’s not a lot to ask
@TMURPH88 @Heywood98 @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I believe the time has come to run Nancy and Chuck out of town like the old days
@LucetVeritas @smart_ass_lynn @Nielsen Well if that’s their attitude Nancy might as well go back on vacation again, as it is no wall no government Democrats caused the shut down, remember that fact
@MAGAGirl10 @Biedaboo @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump There we go again President Obama Rip off    President Trump taking care of the people,  good should prevail over evil,☝️, unless you’re a heartless Democrat, then the role is reversed, to a world of murder, Drugs, Cop Killers, fake news,
@ArizonaKayte @inittowinit007 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @RuthieRedSox @buzzman888 @ReneeCarrollAZ @KMGGaryde @grizzle_meister @bbusa617 @IsraelUSAforevr @mikandynothem @PinkBelgium @PhilMcCrackin44 O the President well not back down
@WayneDupreeShow @BoboMarilyn Well done Judicial Watch that’s what’s needed and I believe elections should be rerun in any area where where large numbers of illegal and ineligible voters were registered it could make the difference, good luck and well done Bless you
@V_actually @jonhsanders2 What an idiot how could anyone take that foolish excuse for a human seriously, go find somewhere to hide and stop frightening people with your words of no meaning to anything or anyone, resign Nancy
@TheRightMelissa @WHwttP1 @realDonaldTrump Obama was bad for everyone and every where he went, all times lining his pockets, just like all Democrats do
@TomFitton @RepJoeWilson @realDonaldTrump @RashidaTlaib So when Joe Wilson tells the truth they wanted to attack him and the Democrats lie every time they open their mouth, their gutter mouths and vulgar language knows no bounds shame on them, but then that’s what you get when you deal with lowlife
@JesseGramling @WHwttP1 @CharismaticRob @SenSanders @SpeakerPelosi Yes you are correct the wall will happen one way or another, with the help of decent law abiding citizens good luck
@RL9631 @ChucksWife1973 @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @SpeakerPelosi Schumer understands but he has no backbone, and as for translating it for Pelosi her brain is fried with hate one can see by looking at her she’s not in good health, and also she is so in deep with criminality she cannot get out, she is in a very awkward position, just resign
@TrueEyeTheSpy @Lori85136760 Well said good will prevail, thank the lord for President Donald Trump, keep him safe and good luck 👍
@RichardWeaving @AcidRayneStorm That is what will keep President Trump in The White House for the next 6 years, he could go down as one of the greatest Presidents the country ever had, look Law and order, Jobs, National security, good health care, tackling Drug and People traffickers, it goes on, God Bless D.T.
@PurpleIsCovfefe @CindyBe87902296 Now you’re talking my language, follow the money it will lead you to the culprit, and an audit with proper due diligence by tax experts will expose a multitude you’ll see 🙏
@VP @VictoriadParks2 @POTUS The only ones not working Chuck and Nancy a pair of fraudsters, not fit for purpose, puppets of evil drug lords they are behind these Caravans and people trafficking, shame on you two, the lord almighty will get you, how do you sleep??
@LoriinUtah @jonhsanders2 You got it in one, in the past Republicans backed down, the Democrats have to release President Trump is a very different animal, he will root out all the corruption waged by Democrats their fake news and lies will catch up with them, and good will prevail over evil, Chuck/Nancy
@JudicialWatch @WHwttP1 Well done Judical Watch why I ask is it left to you to get the right thing done bless you 🙏
@w_terrence @IWiIlkaga @RealJamesWoods Good man you can take a bow 🙇 you certainly told him where to get of and you said that with feeling 🤜 that kind, you’re a good man praise the lord for you 👍
@RealSaavedra Thank goodness a governor with guts and honor as well as common sense, praise the lord for Gov. Scott Bless you good luck 👍
@GregEpps5 @VikingGoddess1 Not only do they not care about America, they don’t care about the nations people, and yes they are Traitors and Hypocrites, so intent in destroying America and it’s people,I believe when more people wake up to that fact the people will react, and then Nancy and Chuck Lord Help U
@GregHalversonCO @Ms_lol_tweets What a disgrace to humanity to have that thing call itself human it is not, I can only try to imagine what kind of hellhole she lives in to have access to that type of language, that belongs in the gutter, ordinary decent people will not listen to that filth,
@ABC Well done Mr President you made me smile with that statement, and it is a national emergency, when asked if that’s threat , reply I never threaten anybody, love it 😊👍
@TallahForTrump @VictoriadParks2 Yes ladies you are the Buisness, I take my hat off to you for seeing more so you are clever and brainy to see the lake news and  lies coming from the Democrats, the President wants to make America great for all its people, praise the lord for you and Bless you thank you 🙏
@PDChina @neasham_sherrie As a civil engineer I have to say give us the money we can do anything, a civil engineer dreams about structures like those in their sleep Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1836 or thereabouts had to work with slide rules ect today with the help of computers we can design anything
@dbongino Nancy Pelosi you’re not interested in the constitution you have broken everything the constitution stands for, you break its rules, and above all the constitution was drawn up to like the Magna Carta to protect the citizens from people like you, and your Algebraic sum equal O
@VP Stick to your guns 💪 good man Mike Pence here here 👍
@johncardillo @IWiIlkaga @TheRickWilson I told you they were out there
@SteveScalise @IWiIlkaga @realDonaldTrump They were great speeches and to point everyone from the President down spoke the truth one cannot argue with stubborn facts, in less your mentally deranged unfortunately they are out there
@Henryhahadavis @realDonaldTrump Good man you tell them, more decent people like you needed praise the lord for you 👍
@bennyjohnson Insults are complements from those who know no better, and in this case it’s 100% true
@SaraCarterDC @sara And rightly so that’s what it is people are pussyfooting around, call it what it is a national security emergency, just like the Democrats
@TomFitton How did an idiot like that get elected to anything, I think she got a fright afterwards, more to come watch out
@JosephB96570073 Abraham Lincoln said the same thing that it would start from within and it does sound like the Democrats 👍
@CoastalAudiox @Ms_lol_tweets @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump The Democrats are definitely more interesting in helping the illegal alien migrants, and drug cartels, people trafficking than they are the American people, you have to ask why, there is huge amounts of money corruption flowing their way, no ??
@Ciarabelles Arrest them bring them before the courts Jail them if need be
@Nigelrefowens You guys take care of our Nigel we need him back in good shape 🏉cheers happy new year 🎆
@mel_faith1 @Heywood98 Hank Johnson as usual got it wrong the Democrats were the ones who owned slaves, Republicans did not, also people who live out in the country side live longer than city folk also the Drug dealers and social spongers as well as drug users all vote Democrat they do not live longer
@heyitsCarolyn @Irish_LJ Yes just build the wall stop talking about it build the wall
@PatriotMike6 @Irish_LJ And Donald Trump will fight and win bless him
@RudyGiuliani @firesnuffer Then that law has to be addressed ASAP, there shouldn’t be any safe havens in any country for criminals so government do you’re job, protect the people that’s what you were elected to do
@RealBasedMAGA @esme35975435 That didn’t matter to them they were in power, now that the Republicans are in its not ok, which again shows their two faced hypocrisy, you also have to look at CNN for their role who is paying them ?? Drugs ?
@Heywood98 @Cuds_1246 @1acemadsen1 What Democrats are doing is that Abraham Lincoln warned Americans about when he said, America will never be destroyed from the outside, if we falter and loose our freedom it will be because we destroyed ourselves, and that is exactly what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are doing
@beth2_k3a @leslieh707 He has a plan which was voted on and passed, now they want to change their minds, so they can import illegal migrant voters, get a life
@Living4Earth @VinaigretteGirl @politicususa When the Government doesn’t work you shut it down, if you’re car breaks down you take it to the repair shop, after it’s repaired you put it back on the road again, and so when the government is repaired it will be allowed to work again thank you, sue Chuck and Nancy
@RBReich @VinaigretteGirl I am sorry for your mindset,  not two more years, six more years wake up smell like coffee, look around you more jobs, more money in peoples, balance of payments coming down, better security  that’s what people want and that’s what they are getting,  the Democrats trying destroy
@PrisonPlanet @inittowinit007 Catch that bastard, let him release whatever he has so what, number one it will catch him, and the illegally obtained material cannot be used in court, the people who died in 9/11 deserve more than this, some lowlife trying to profit on their misfortune, how low can one stoop?

@Don_Vito_08 @leslieh707 @realDonaldTrump @NancyPelosi Yes even Nancy Pelosi wants the wall she is so intent in her hate for the President she is blinded by the fact, which calls into question her state of mind and her ability to serve, I do believe she is suffering from some sort of mental breakdown, which is sad, take a break Nancy
@ThatTimWalker @VinaigretteGirl You cannot bin Brexit the people voted in a referendum in a Democratic country to leave and that’s It
@warrenmorgan @VinaigretteGirl @Nigel_Farage There will be no Mep.s after March I believe
@AnnCoulter @Steve5615 Yes I agree with you now to get those criminals out of the government, by what ever means I would prefer non violent, using the law, unless someone has a better idea
@realDonaldTrump President Trump will win in 2020 and after that the Republicans will win back the house mostly helped Nancy and Chuck although they don’t realize that yet
@_LoveLike_JESUS @contessalee Absolutely you can have as many Amen s 🙏 I absolutely agree with you Bless you

@LBC @AnnBank41695841 @ShelaghFogarty Angela Merkel is a disaster for Germany she will cause another catastrophe situation equal to what happened when Hitler came to power she is sowing the seeds to make that happen unless the Conservative German people take control of their country they will be lost, do what Uk did

@DougDerby @trumptrain1111 Lord rest my much loved departed Dad used to say,  Gates,Walls, and locks are good for keeping decent law abiding people out, a mad man is a different animal, I am not advocating anything, as a God living Protestant Christian, I cannot vouch for the wild non believers,  Bless all
@trumptrain1111 @DougDerby I wonder how safe do Pelosi and Schumer feel they may need to bolster their own security as people are becoming outraged at their actions and inactions they have to realize there are some wild people out there, and they are committing treasonous acts, by not doing what they swore
@RealJamesWoods @DougDerby James the Democrats existence is based on fake news, lies and generated Rumors, and remember Rumor is Created by Haters, Spread by Fools, and Accepted by Idiots, how does one get past that, the President has to use what ever it takes to protect the nation 8 U.S. Code 1182 is law
@DougDerby @PaulDHeenan @thejournal_ie Well we have allow, the Prof is always correct and right even when he’s or she wrong, a little bit like a wife in an argument with you
@DougDerby @PaulDHeenan @thejournal_ie Yes you made me smile and I agree legal is not always right, if it was the Lawyers would have nothing to argue about, what I mean by legal, law and order it’s the fabric that holds normal society together, before the Magna Charta and Magna Carter were there was no law, Anarchy
@WestmonsterUK @Sturner72213136 @sajidjavid Yes deport them ASAP if you don’t more will come, put them in a RAF fat Albert put parachutes on them, fly over the territory they came from let the ramp down, connect the ripcord bye bye don’t come back, O you may keep the parachute also give them a lunch box
@LeonardCarril11 @PatriotMadd @EmmaAnn47064878 @Great_Jill @cmarinucci The Democrat lefties will always spread fake news without any foundation I take comfort from a fact, Rumors are Created by Haters, Spread by Fools and  Accepted by Idiots, that’s what the Democrats are made of
@Witsend08135301 @Agrant3595Grant Nancy you’re a hypocrite you don’t give a dam about children or god if the people riot and come after you god will forgive them, god will not forgive you, you’re creating a very dangerous situation for your self
@Cuds_1246 @gatewaypundit Those border agents should take those illegal migrants to the nearest border crossings and dump them back into Mexico hire thousands more border agents, if you need them, use guns, use gas, what ever you have to this is gone beyond a joke, remember this is the Democrats fault
@WayneDupreeShow That Woman Markel will caused another war there will be bodies in the streets of France and Germany as well as neighboring countries it will happen as sure as day and night the people will not put up with what’s happening and when they have no other way rebellion, gunfire killing
@AmyMek @1Davie1 Kick them out Germany wake up you will have another problem on your hands as big as the last, get rid of the present government they are sinking you
@BrianODriscoll @offtheball Good game Brain a bit like the old days over heated at times, I liked Keith Earls interception, however as a Leinster supporter sorry we lost, but as usual all well in the Bar after words cheers
@IrishAirCorps @OC1OPS Well done AirCorps thank you and Happy New Year to all in the service bless you
@Cuds_1246 @gatewaypundit The President is absolutely correct the Democrats are responsible especially Nancy Pelosi shame on her
@MiamiShowband @donlav Yes I absolutely agree, those officers in charge should be prosecuted it was a most hideous crime against one of their own, the Garda are a brotherhood and they are supposed to look after each other, Maurice is a strong man lucky, his wife and family could never be compensated
@TomFitton @tigerandyx9 @JudicialWatch Tom you’re doing a fantastic job exposing these political criminals in the Democratic Party, classic wolf in sheep’s clothing, they all sounded so pious and nice, but remember the best conmen are, the best salesman are, they wouldn’t know the truth if it bit them on the nose
@HLAurora63 @neasham_sherrie All of you so called mental health doctors need, mental health treatment your selves your profession is one of the most controversial professions in medicine two or three you go into court and give totally different diagnoses for the same person,  give us a break,
@ChuckCallesto Wait until they start investigation on you, you pillock and the other drug financed Democrats It well be more than lawyers you will need, these drug cartels don’t like to be welshed on

@DevinNunes @KMPHFOX26 A yes I really like that well done and with a glint in your eyes sharp as a button I wish you well, keep on going good luck happy new year 2019
@YeahSureRight1 @BobBrinson1 Yes you could right the pease loving nations of the world create a democrat country where people live in harmony, migrants come in from countries where they say there is unrest,they say they want a better life, before you know it they are creating unrest in our country wake up
@My2CentsXOGRIT @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump What an idiot, even when I make allowances for his 94 years old still cannot make out what way his failing mind works, yes? O are you sure? Yes, I was going by his looks, thank you, well it seems he’s not 94 years old my mistake, making allowances for the old timer, even worse
@Dlw20161950 @MissyJo79 Yes you got it in a nut shell, you call it by it’s real name, Harboring criminals and fugitives, one has to ask why, there is obviously a payout why else? They call them sanctuary which implies animals or people in danger need sanctuary, Prison apply to criminal and fugitives
@BobBrinson1 And about time you cannot have criminal safe havens what a joke yes prosecute the politicians who promote these criminal safe havens
@DC_ARVSgt Well Sarg words fail most people in a situation like this, where did lead by example go, I am reminded of the proverb, (The last refuge of a scoundrel is politics ) you may be able grant a fools pardon on that, Happy new year to you and your family and stay safe in 2019 bless you
@ThePaulColton Yes I agree, but what about Keith Earls something else, a tough hard game,  Munster deserved the win, and that coming from a Leinster man  then that’s Rugby all friends afterwards in the bar, Happy new Reverend Bishop Paul Colton and best wishes to you and your family in 2019 🙏
@andersonDrLJA @neasham_sherrie I will agree with that President Jimmy Carter, coming from you that’s a plus and thank you
@marklevinshow @UghToHillary They used to burn witches, in the old days in The British isles, I am not putting ideas in anymore, just a history lesson you know what I mean, and you know there are still witches around,
@LeonardCarril11 @Great_Jill @PatriotMadd @EmmaAnn47064878 @cmarinucci I just have praise the lord for the President and the Republicans 🙏
@LeonardCarril11 @Great_Jill @PatriotMadd @EmmaAnn47064878 @cmarinucci Please do not connect me with any one or anything that says anything wrong about President Donald Trump, he is a breath of fresh air, and he will win the 2020 election in a landslide, help him build the wall, and root out corruption in the Democrats, and deport the criminals
@TomFitton @Zarnie50 @BreitbartNews There is a need for more practical law men like Sheriff Adam Christianson who the political representatives should pay more attention to, this is a man with great abilities, in his job as a lawman when he says he needs something, to combat crime for Christ sake listen to him
@hotairblog @arkiegal411 She should do to prison, and also stripped of Mayorship, who needs credibility when you have her, is she on the take from the traffickers as well, into a federal prison you have to go
@yaf @Zarnie50 @DineshDSouza Yes I like that that’s the only way it will work thank you
@RodStryker @TenquidOk Pelosi is a complete and utter disgrace she is without an ounce of humanity, if you look at the way she speaks, she is a mentally deranged person, when she answers that mother, our people are not breaking the law, she is insane, no doubt
@heyitsCarolyn @rjones8194 Build the wall, build the wall
@MattalianoGuy @inittowinit007 What an idiot, could someone show this clown what he said, and stat he never said it, the camera did not lie this is why this man should be in a mental hospital
@lionsofficial Nice one Bill congratulations 🍾 an icon in the Rugby world and a true gentleman good luck Bill best wishes to you and your family 👍
@KLSouth @PeterCRoberts45 Pelosi are you looking you heartless thing, are you having a good time on holidays, Officer Singh’s wife and baby are not, shame on you
@1776_ben @Heywood98 Shame on you California you’re a disgrace, there must be something the senate can do
@BobBrinson1 That will never happen there will be war if that happens mark my words, if that is forced on European nations there will be a 3rd World War
@cmarinucci @LeonardCarril11 The President and the senate does not want to shut down the border, he wants to build a security wall to protect people’s lives and two faced Democrats well not step up and do what they have already voted for, the boss has to use what ever he has to achieve this, Democrats fault
@RealJack @trocbe I agree with you, shame on those small narrow minded people, they really don’t matter, people will see through their fake minds
@IWiIlkaga @b_pinheiro21 @politico Just build the wall where ever the money comes from, close the border until the wall is built
@IWiIlkaga @b_pinheiro21 @politico I know I have watched the speeches time and time again they made political ground promising to build the wall, so now that President Trump is getting on with it they appose it, what is wrong with those people, Israel and Turkey have walls that work why not US Mexico border?
@AmyMek @1Davie1 Germany wake up get your right wing government in place before it’s to late, double the police force, and crackdown on illegal migrants thugs you have to take control of law and order or your lost
@IngrahamAngle @1Davie1 Pressure should be put on Mexico to stop the migrants getting there, if not close the border with Mexico in til they do, then double the size of Ice and border security round up all illegals and deport them,
@plantlady293 @Hellrazor1776 Nancy you’re looking like a lost soul on your way to no where, why not have a little talk with your religious advisor vicar, paster, priest what ever and they may be able to help you, because you look troubled to me, you need to prepare yourself to meet your maker, not doing well
@RomanEcho @JillJillhe The reason Nancy Pelosi is on holidays is she simply doesn’t care what happens to the people, she puts up to being liberal, when in fact she sees the people as plebes, and she herself the plutocrat and that is the simple fact
@TrumperSeaney @Heywood98 @realDonaldTrump @wolfblitzer Brilliant idea get on with it, lock🔒 it down  Mexico government will then step up and help its in their interest
@GOPLeader @UghToHillary I am so so glad these cowards are in custody do not give them bail, praise to the lord for all law enforcement officers especially Sheriff Youngblood who let these criminals and others know you will not get away this and now, political reps. do you job, come clean start working
@ABUAJ_US @ChucksWife1973 Run them out of the country
@michzoa Nancy polasci

@OLSCRugby @leinsterrugby @ProperChurch U the men 👍🎆
@WeAreOne_Q @PTorney Thanks to President Trump 🙏🤜👍🎆🥂
@Education4Libs @PTorney Now then you put it in the right order the people will stand with their President the more he exposes corruption the more the people back him it is going on far to long, it is getting to the point one cannot tell the Democrat from the criminal or maybe they are one and the same ?
@rising_serpent @SusanKMunson2 Sheriff you are a brave man, you speak the truth with passion and I commend you for that, every branch of law enforcement should work together and freely share information in the interest of the law abiding citizens, and any political leadership who disagree need B investigated
@ChuckCallesto O no you don’t President Trump will win the 2020 with a landslide, why do you think he became president, because the people were fed up with Democrats corruption, or do you not realize that, you are a comedian if you think otherwise, O you are a comedian, well that explains it
@CB618444 @ChucksWife1973 I believe she should be arrested and charged and if she admits that she did warn them she has to prison, not fined, prison
@DrMartyFox @GalianaIII @realDonaldTrump I absolutely agree with you Democrat’s your responsible for the officers death shame on you, you’re a bunch of clowns, not fit for purpose, and you will be exposed.
@larryelder @hinesriley @SenSchumer Schumer do you realize how stupid you sound, probably not, if you did you would commit yourself to a mental health therapist,
@johncardillo @EversFam @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein @NancyPelosi @AdamSchiff @tedlieu @JerryBrownGov The state of California needs to wake up to its responsibilities and stop harboring killers and drug traffickers shame on you
@MARINE_99ZULU So sad Democrats you’re guilty and don’t forget it
@tictoc @IWiIlkaga Thanks to President Trump thank you mr President

@IrishTimesPol Yes I would agree with that as I dealt with vulture funds and got massive write downs on loans where the banks wouldn’t two clients got out at 28%  the Bank wanted 80%
@politico @IWiIlkaga If the Democrats are not careful they could lose a lot more, this President will not be bullied, So Nancy you better think again,
@GOPChairwoman @lilBee67569241 @realDonaldTrump I believe the Democrats are running out of the, The American people are now seeing them for what they are, at the next election, they will not be able to explain their wrongs away, Schumer won’t care he’ll be will past it, others might worry about their party

@MazurikL @BrantVoss These are the idiots we are dealing with, of course Jesus comes first, you never see people seeking asylum or trying to get into a communist country, it’s always they want to come to capitalism and conservative states, ever wonder why, it’s the only way to create good standards,
@Quoimio Tom you have to realize you are dealing with a Person it very low intelligence in this area, Nancy is an academic and as you may know academics have to be told what to do, they are not equipped with the skills needed for leadership or consequences of inaction, a misfit in place?
@seanictmayo @MayoNorth @MayoDotIE @wildatlanticway I agree there is always plenty to see the length of the coastline, wonderful place to go 👍

@JackPosobiec @PK_lambert Would CNN ever get a life, are scraping the bottom of the barrel because they cannot find anything else to report, or is that limit of their Pea brain, there were lots of joyful smiling faces why not show some good will CNN,  or is that against your nature? or fake news?

@IrishTimesOpEd I absolutely agree with you, it can bring balance in your life, it is also an escape from the stress of Buisness into a place where you don’t have to prove anything to anyone except yourself, it’s a good place to be thank you
@GOP @IWiIlkaga What is wrong with the guy, when I look at his actions , the way he fidgets he acts like he has a mental problem, I don’t like being unkind to people who have problems, but really, as Dirty Harry said, a man has to know his limitations,
@charliekirk11 @tomjones1478 Good man standing up for you beliefs 👍
@ChuckCallesto No you two fools are, Dumb and Dumber Dwa

@OliverMcGee @MrsAguzzi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Absolutely correct the government is only the bursar or keeper of the peoples money 💰
@GetFit_4Life @LeonardCarril11 What an idiot

@RealJamesWoods @neasham_sherrie Schumer should resign and allow someone with balls to take his place he is a embarrassment to his party colleagues, let alone the nation, he should be charged with treason against humanity and the nation
@LaylaAlisha11 @neasham_sherrie @SenSchumer @POTUS Chuck you’re an idiot and now the world knows it, and there has to be a mental faculty that could deal with your condition, or maybe not perhaps it’s a prison, shame on you

@pharvey2001 @neasham_sherrie @hotelicemachine @KamalaHarris If Schumer is playing politics with the people’s safety and security, shame on him, or can he not see how difficult his life can become if he carries on like this, he is playing with a very different type in this President than any other, he will be the looser so Mr Schumer ??

@Navy_Lady_45 @ClwtrBkAtty @Alyssa_Milano There is no place in world for that way of thinking, women are equal to men and lots of cases more senior
@ACTforAmerica @JudyMarie4DT Socialism has never worked in the world and never will, look at Russia, China, Cuba, the people changed to capitalism and they prospered, that’s the answer
@charliekirk11 @Steve5615 I agree with you about being spectacular I am unable to answer why it’s not taught more widely I have the King James Bible and often look at the way I might do something and a read to reflect and refresh and pick out parts that are relevant to what I am doing, and personal to me

@AerLingus Merry Christmas 🎄 Aerlingus  and all your stuff, thank you for looking after me during the year, wish you good luck in 2019 🍀👍
@breakfastattigf What ever has to be done build the wall, Democrats say the wall won’t work,  prisons have walls to keep people in, walls also keep people out and people safe, Democrats you’re not entitled to be that stupid, the country cannot afford you that privilege, cop on
@realDonaldTrump @D1sc41 @Anna_Giaritelli @dcexaminer And it will keep on climbing as people see through the fake news coming from especially CNN shame on them, they have no credibility
@AnnCoulter @D1sc41 Because the Democrats have organized the Caravan through their criminal associates and drug traffickers, why else would they be apposed to the wall
@BlueSea1964 @DreamCrafterB The police should have let the angry crowd have him for an hour or so with more baseball bats , then give him life in prison without parole
@KMGGaryde @seecyn5858 @realDonaldTrump By the time President Trump finishes in six years,  the leadership in the Democrats will be in nursing homes with care minders, those who are not will be dead,

@NettaBean21 @GOPChairwoman @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Insults are complements from those who know no better
@3ku1 @GOPChairwoman @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Trump is saving America rebuilding its industry, the dollar going up in value, job creation going up, balance of payments coming down, he is on a roll, that’s all the people want money and jobs, by the time he retires as President in years time Judge him then, he will win a 2nd
@inittowinit007 @jonhsanders2 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr @_America_First @PamB60 @SassyT_Joy @LoriinUtah @BCMsolt @IWasHrren @bonniemurphy @charliekirk11 @realtalkbtr That seems about the right way, but it is important you take them for a walk every day, they won’t eat much by the look of them, and who knows they must be good for something, you might want to keep them as pets,
@ABritperspect @jonhsanders2 Another reason for Brixet where the hell are going, if people are offended by the National flag get out and don’t come back, round these people up and deport them,  like the USA make it an offense to disrespect the national flag
@ConorGogarty @Nigelrefowens @NathanMattick8 Nice one Nigel you’re the man 👍🏉
@ljmwsmith @b77_sarah Now there’s a brave last
@BobBrinson1 @NancyPelosi Is Jed and Granny looking at Nancy Pelosi or Chuck or both maybe
@VHayek214 @Heywood98 @DNC @GOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Now Democrats you’re been left out what are you going to do now, it will cost you at election time, mark my word 😥
@sxdoc @Heywood98 @realDonaldTrump Now that’s the way forward scalable by scalable absolutely correct, now to get the Democrats to put their minds where their mouths are, and they will achieve credibility which they so badly need, or have the criminals such a grip on them they cannot get out, Maybe????
@BobBrinson1 And his drug trafficking friends who fund his operation shame on you
@MiriamOCal @RTERadio1 Miriam of all your programs either radio or tv,your interview with Graham and Louise Jones and bro Rob, was the most inspiring and heartwarming I have listened to Graham was such a remarkable beautiful person praise the lord for for his life, his wife and family,and Rob bless you
@MaryMcAuliffe4 @MiriamOCal Eamon DeValera and the Catholic Church, especially Bishop John Charles Mcquaid will go down in history as two oppressors of women’s rights in Ireland thanks to President Mary Robinson, and other strong women like her in the media there is a dramatic change in balance thank you
@MiriamOCal Well Done Gavin children are great Judges of character, as well as the music 🎼Gavin you score top marks on both fronts, merry Christmas 🎄
@KayBurley @donlav I was so sorry to hear of the passing of Paddy Ashdown, I met Paddy many years ago and had great respect and admiration for him, I recently communicated with him in relation to Briexit, as a military man he was a strategist, praise the lord for paddy’s life and achievements RIP
@JOEdotie If that driver didn’t know he was doing wrong  he shouldn’t have a driving license, I even believe he needs a minder to go shopping well done Garda
@vulcantothesky Love the Vulcan beautiful airplane
@MiriamOCal @RTENewsNow Yes Miriam the great man his music has kept my listening relaxing evenings by the fire worth while and memorable thank you Van keep well

@GardaTraffic Well done Garda 👍
@IrishCoastGuard @Smith555E Thank you Coast Guard, you’re doing a fantastic job, I would also like to remember my friend Captain Dara Fitzpatrick and her crew who gave their lives for us at Black Sod praise the lord for their lives and sacrifice may they rest in piece 🙏, and Happy Christmas to you all
@Grommet05700268 @BreitbartNews @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF I support multi cultural societies I support humanitarian aid, i do not support criminals who steal from the caravan people with false promises, don’t support Drug or child sex traffickers who are financing the caravan, if people come in legally they are welcome I’m color blind
@romfordroy @AnnBank41695841 @DavidLammy That’s another reason for Brexit and Irexit a bunch of inept clowns looking to take over our sovereignty, and makes mess of our lives even more than they have already, that Brussels outburst has echoes of a little guy with with a little mustache from the past, no way EU
@AnEnglishRevolt @Biedaboo So that’s a good argument for Brexit if I ever heard one, I voted for Brexit for all those reasons, and the fact that a lot of people today, don’t have respect for authority, the fact that we and these disrespectful people are able to live as we do, is the democracy we live in
@SenateGOP @IWiIlkaga What changed the simple answer is nothing , the Democrats only ever talked about it, but never did anything, fake statements on TV brain washed people into thinking they were taking action, now that the President is doing something about it frightens them , hypocrites game over
@charliekirk11 @BRumbolo That is one of the best arguments I have heard so far building the wall well stated thank you 🙏 hope you Democrat’s are listening and more important heeding, now talk about money 💰???
@TheRealShaunaMT @blingarama @LindseyGrahamSC You got it in one, the right to vote should only be afforded to a citizen
@MrWyattEarpLA @seecyn5858 Take a little comfort from an old proverb, ( insults are complements from those who know no better) when some people loosing they’ll resort to lies, name calling, and fake news, and that tells you their caliber, they are entitled to a fools pardon poor things
@DubFireBrigade Well Done Guys 👍you made someones Christmas 🎄 a little happier,and happy Christmas to all Fire Brigades throughout the country especially those who are on duty over Christmas, you do a fantastic job Thank you 🙏 stay safe
@BrandonN1271 @Cuds_1246 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateGOP @SenateDems @congressdotgov @congressorg @WhiteHouse @POTUS @FLOTUS @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr Very good point, tell the Democrats good thinking 👍
@RealJack @BoboMarilyn Hope you’re correct
@b77_sarah @Cuds_1246 I wonder what the Pilgrim Fathers would have to say if they came back today,  what a mess you have made of what we gave you, President Donald Trump is the only hope of salvaging the country from the brink of disaster, Gods speed Mr President keep going you have right on your side
@BreitbartNews @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Well done Austria at least some one is getting sense, the EU is not working, it will never work politically, it has a chance as a trade group nothing else,
@dmills3710 @Cuds_1246 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @freedomcaucus @GenFlynn Yes you are correct the only person with B***s in the country’s leadership you are correct to back him
@CBPArizona @CBP Load them up take them back to where they come from, if they come back lock them up for ten years that will stop them coming, stop making life soft for them, you are creating mega problems and trouble for your children’s future,  wake up
@gmw3751 That is disrespectful and disgusting what is going on, the world is gone mad, you give a vote to someone who hardly knows who he is, let alone who or what he is voting for ?? That lady needs a different job doing what I.have no idea??
@AnnCoulter @JakeSno46 The Democrats know it will work that’s why they are oppressed to it, their friends won’t be able to travel freely with their drug trafficking, simple answer
@kwilli1046 @deltacrook Well done young man 👍 for me you are the winner
@kwilli1046 @deltacrook You have made a friend for life that guy will remember you for ever, you are so kind, you will have a lot of luck in your life thank you 🙏
@DC_ARVSgt Sgt Harry I had very little to do with my name when I was christened , John-Joe, the hyphen (-) makes it one, like Johnny Cash and a boy named Sue 😥🤜 have a good day
@NancyPelosi @OCNaNa2013 Nancy you’re the one who is responsible for the shutdown of government, your so full of hate for the President it’s consuming you, you should be a better person than this, humanity and the people and their security, is what’s important not your private war with President
@JayVanorman @Clofconnie Ted got it in the best way to explain and most important reasons for the wall and shows the Democrats for what they are, their hate for the President seems to be more important to them than the people’s security, they should face facts President Trump will win another term,
@GOPChairwoman @o1wbQ5uObJ9GeBF Which proves the Democrats are out to destroy the USA a lot of people believe they are involved in the drug trafficking cartels, criminals gangs ect, why else would they have voted the way they did?
@TomFitton @TrumpGirlDebbie Bring them to a border post and send back to Mexico do not give them asylum remember that the President said anyone entering illegally will not get asylum, send them back
@DC_ARVSgt A yes Sarg. I like the little bit of sarcasm re good luck with future insurance, however that’s a very real threat to a driver hopefully that will make one think twice, Merry Christmas to you and all police especially those who are on duty over the Christmas break, thank you 🙏
@TerryKalUSMC What a great idea
@donlav Very good point Don drones could be a very real problem and the ability to weaponize is definitely a problem it needs to be addressed now and not when something happens tsk.
@GardaTraffic Well done Tallaght Garda, I think we will nominate you for Xfactor, need a manager? A just asking, and happy Christmas to all members of the Garda,  especially those on duty over Christmas, thank you and stay safe, bless you all

@RoyalAirForce Merry Christmas to you all stay safe and thank you 🙏
@IrishTimes And about time thank you Garda and happy Christmas to you all 👍
@IrishTimesOpEd @realDonaldTrump Not a chance
@AngelaMinear1 @realDonaldTrump @teddybe54765526 Just wait for the fraudulent and criminal facts that is about to hit the media in the coming month or so involving the Dems. You will be shocked 😳 you know what is said about the last laugh ?
@Michhelleeex Now the people are behind the President, and make sure everyone knows the Democrats tried to stop progress on the wall, their associates won’t be able to walk freely into the country with drugs and people trafficking, child abuse, Democrats it’s over
@realDonaldTrump @teddybe54765526 Bravo Mr President I had no doubt that you would have the wall built, even the Democrats realize that fact now, their loss they could have been part of it, sadly for them they lost again God Bless America and happy Christmas and New Years greetings
@owillis @colettebrowne You will have the wall thank you 🙏
@IndoSport @leinsterrugby Johnny you have now got as many awards as Rory, We won’t know  to give you two next year, congratulations Johnny happy Christmas and New Years many thanks Mate 👍🍾🏉
@jonsnowC4 @donlav This could be the end for drones or at least, register and issue a license to own one, make it law ?
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Well done President Trump,  we all knew the Caravan was the brainchild of the Democrats to try and cause as many problems as possible for the President, well it blew up in their faces, the ICE police and the Military did a great job, the fake news manufacturers are silent 🎄🎆
@ZonePhysics @patrick_emmet There wouldn’t be much use for that kind of thing where I live, we use our thumbs holding the lighter in our hands it works very well, 👍
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Well done guys good fun
@charliekirk11 Now how about that, next one please Democrat’s keep on scoring own goals, when will they ever learn, probably never
@PatsyMcGarryIT @IrishTimes Sick bastard castrate him then send him to Siberia
@robjh1 @teddybe54765526 @realDonaldTrump I agree with you man,  build the dam wall stop talking about it move on to something else
@Independent_ie That’s Rich coming from Jeremy Corbyn he should at least have a little respect for the lady, some  people are using his name as an icon for stupidity in politics
@consmover @rwaller73 I believe Chuck and Nancy have already lost their minds, have you not seem Nancy been interviewed lately, she keeps forgetting and not sure what to say, Chuck is so filled with emotion over the President he cannot concentrate on the job he was elected to do, I wish them well
@MAGA_United @donnia8789 Well done to everyone the wall is getting built by the President and the patriotic citizens loyal to the USA 🇺🇸 the people who say, ( I love the USA) with feeling and mean it,
@imogensound @BrianKolfage @FoxNews @BreitbartNews @RyanAFournier @MarkDice @GOPLeader @mattgaetz @kristina_wong @gehrig38 @DonaldJTrumpJr Your language is ugly and disrespectful, when people resort like this, you need anger management, people sending money for the wall are called patriots, and law abiding citizens, who want the nation to be safe for the good of its citizens, maybe you have a problem with that
@marklevinshow @austinrokker The problem is, if the new evidence coming out now about thhad been available before the election the result would have been a lot different the next election is only a few years away the Dems. better start doing their jobs or they will suffer
@TheMarkPantano @austinrokker It is one of the most important items in the USA at the moment, anybody thought of a name for the wall it has to have Trump in it
@BrianKolfage @FoxNews @BreitbartNews @RyanAFournier @MarkDice @GOPLeader @mattgaetz @kristina_wong @gehrig38 @DonaldJTrumpJr Must be killing the Democrats, make it tall make it strong, keep their Drug and criminal supporters and funder friends out
@SophieLong01 That’s what moms do, and the cost for you is love her
@ChristusPatriot @donnia8789 No effort should be spared in finding these mindless criminal thugs, give  them all 20 years there is plenty of evidence on video
@IsraelUSAforevr @LauraDiebra Let them know that anything that aids the illegal aliens in getting to their destination will be destroyed this is a war, you always destroy the enemies supplies, go legal or go home
@Fake_Ljaschko @JudyMarie4DT @OnlineMagazin Fantastic did you not have a whip or a leather strap, just so he remembers his visit to your house
@barmore27 @BPPope Absolutely correct to build the wall, why not fund the wall out of the defense budget, after all the wall is a defensive item, and the Caravan invaders are a threat to national security, and I believe President Trump is in charge of that account so  one wall please, thank you 🙏
@Non_MSM_News @EversFam I new he would find a way 👍
@iamfearlesssoul @standbyme1972 That’s a very sad Attitude if you think some people don’t like you, then they don’t matter, be sure lots do like you don’t be insecure be positive, join the self admiration society cheers

But did the Tea have a calming effect to your members allowing them to sort the unfolding problem if so there’s the answer, have more Tea Breaks
@tomhappens Fantastic lively tune never get tired listening
@bonniemurphy @harborgirl21 @ABC And now for the Clinton come come now hand it over
@SiCarswell @IrishTimes Have a bit of manners, and remember you were a guest
@TexasVengeance @MARINE_99ZULU The Democrats didn’t care who dies as long as they can use situations to attack President Trump, they can’t use the migrants caravan in Mexico anymore so they have abandoned them, they are immoral, lying leaches and they will be exposed the President doesn’t play by their rules
@IrishTimesWorld Well done Belgium, there will be a lot more to follow your example, about time we woke up to the spongers
@IvanYatesNT @HenryMcKean @AXA Thanks Ivan good idea please slow down save lives
@Independent_ie Dirty old bastard give him hard time
@Seanfhear59 @MaryOGrady8 @campaignforleo @rtenews What a laugh the yellow vest demonstration in France has nothing to do with socialism it’s the complete opposite, they want the hard right to take over and stop bowing to liberals and socialism, and put hard line conservatives in power to stop handouts by the socialist government
@fox32news @PrimaryB2 Get the bastard then give him life in harsh prison, help the police
@Jayhawker4Trump @PrimaryB2 @BellaInxs2 @dalecanfixit @usanovak @WillWtroyer @beckybu04429881 @Sequencer16 @PaulieD55 @MavisJ1 @ernie_plumley @originaljipssy @JouMoore @dpsgpa @FounderLiberty @FLOTUS Merry Christmas to you also First Lady Melania have a fun time cheers 🥂
@The_Trump_Train @blingarama @realDonaldTrump Keep up the good work you have another six years to go, and maybe by then you will have done so much good, the nation will want you to declare your self President for life how about that
@Paul_OConnell Well Paul it did you no harm good clean Atlantic air cheers mate
@mitchellvii @kelvis4519 Yes that’s them I agree
@Daks_Normandy @donlav Fantastic airplane though as an old boot
@17Thanq @Heywood98 How did they think they would get away with it, like Isaac Newton’s third law of relativity, and Karma, those laws will never change,and the thing they have on their side, is time, it keeps on running like the rivers.
@MikeLingPilot @nottmhospitals @NUHNeonatal Mike looks like you are good at other things as well, they’re beautiful , enjoy them cheers mate and happy Christmas 🎄👍
@Cuds_1246 @Heywood98 In that case you are unemployable no other religion gets time to pray why should you, Businesses are there to make money and create jobs not to pay people to pray sorry
@ChuckGrassley @IWiIlkaga You cannot beat the 👩‍🌾 good luck thank you
@leinsterrugby Yes thank you 🙏 what game what an atmosphere thought the bad weather would be a problem not in your nelly, storms or not we were going thanks guys 👍🍾
@RealSaavedra @Biedaboo Build the wall and stop the Democrats getting paid by the criminal traffickers and drug cartels
@rugby_ie Yes Rory a brilliant idea come on Joe show them how it’s done ✅
@IrishTimesOpEd What a plonker he couldn’t organize a P. Up in a  brewery let alone lead the country
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga We absolutely agree with you President Donald Trump every sailable, Democrats have lost their way and respect sad
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Well done 👍 President Trump you’re on a roll
@TelBabe @FergKerry I believe the EU will not survive,it started out as a trading group, that’s where it should have stayed I voted for Brexit, I would vote for Irexit given the choice,clever people lean to the right foolish people to the left, every army needs Conservative Generals Margret Thatcher
@DavidKing478 @RobertL29302273 @AGLynch @Comey @POTUS Unbelievable but true they have to answer the questions they cannot get away from the wrong they did and expect to get away with it, or possibly they do expect to get away, expose their deeds, criminality cannot be part of government the law must be obeyed otherwise you’re lost
@Jamierodr10 @jonhsanders2 He knows a lot more than you and your other fraudulent friends, you’re going to be exposed,
@RoxxxyGurL @frespirit01 @Mo_An2016 @stacy_redvirgo @battleofever @Bitchin50 @Dragonshimmy @ar15m4mid @PatriotJenn @anonymouse4537 @G1rly_Tattooed President Trump will look after our ideals thank you
@LouDobbs @Heywood98 Told you so the beginning of the end of the EU
@01_zebra @Heywood98 More Nancy P corruption, lying, fraud, deception, bullying, Democrats at the next election you are finished
@JayRayy7 @razorme207 Now that’s what true love is all about what a good feeling that sends through you, it is very powerful good luck and happy Christmas to your family 👍
@thejournal_ie @MaryOGrady8 When I see Theresa May and Leo Varadker greeting each other they are happy to see each other, like old friends, Theresa is a very nice and polite lady, and Leo is a very nice and polite chap so why not, I would say Theresa I to kind to (loathe) any one
@piersmorgan @LesleyJ62456075 I actually believe the EU will self destruct,as other countries are not happy with Brussels, it interferes to much in the lives of people and Countries who have very little in common with each other, I voted Brexit in the referendum I have duel citizenship I would vote Irexit yes
@KilclooneyJohn @LesleyJ62456075 That will never happen, there will be a couple of documents with some boxes to be ticked, just for regulation purposes, nothing else, the International aviation organization might even forget about it, ah we must get that done, scare tactics that’s all
@secretstranger9 @LighteningBolt9 That’s a stupid question it’s twenty years ago, since that was written off as was the United Kingdom’s war debt to the USA.
@Stop_The_EU @LighteningBolt9 The reason why? The Second World War was caused by trying to collect such debts from the First World War, and it wasn’t secretly written off, none of it was ever collected it was never ever going to be collected what do want a Third World War? Where have you been?
@realDonaldTrump @AZGoodFella2 The Democrats have been scamming for ever using taxpayers money through schemes that allow ways to skim their share into various funds for themselves, it’s disgusting, now they are owned by these helpers and cannot get out, come clean before it’s to late, President Trumps coming
@Heywood98 @BobBrinson1 @BreitbartTexas Yes build the wall Nancy P. Help your President and your nation and you salvage some little bit of credibility and stop looking like a bad person women are supposed to be better than that, what’s your problem?
@MagniFieri @austinrokker Yes you have the answers, she was taken thousands of miles by her trafficking criminal family, abused not fed left for dead, the Democrats who encouraged them to come to the USA who’s goal is to create trouble for President Trump are also to blame, be careful what you wish for
@lukefitz11 No not nice
@teddybe54765526 Well Done and praise the lord for their lives and their sacrifice and hope they are strolling along in a faraway land the beautiful home of the lord may they rest in piece
@CRTV @teddybe54765526 I really like that,  it is in-fact common sense and you cannot argue with that those messages have to be got out not hidden, this will expose the flaws in others and bring out the good in the Trump admiration will done guys
@rugby_ie Fantastic news congratulations Johnny kept my fingers crossed and there you are 🎈 🎉 🍾 you deserve it have a fantastic Christmas and thank you , your the greatest 👍
@55true4u @PTorney No doubt about it he is doing a fantastic job, the Democrats are on self distrust mode, Nancy will see to that  faster than you think,
@ScottPresler @esme35975435 Well done guys keep up the good work 🙏👍🎆
@Vicky4Trump2020 @esme35975435 @GenFlynn @realDonaldTrump @BarbaraRedgate @EricTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @dbongino @SaraCarterDC Yes Vicky you got it in one,  they have been lying to you for years and years and it takes a strong man like President Trump to root out the villains and fraudsters and he will, it is possible that President Trump will go down as one of the greatest Presidents, and become an icon
@sherry25793049 @BoboMarilyn Yes faith is a wonderful thing, and very powerful only when we have a problem we seem to call to our faith and so, Just because you cannot see the the air doesn’t mean you stop breathing and just because you cannot see God doesn’t mean you stop believing, Amen happy Christmas all
@leinsterrugby @AVIVAStadium @OLSCRugby Good stuff guys and thank you
@bbusa617 @frespirit01 Yes the Democrats are such a corrupt party they want to destroy America keep uncovering and publishing this corruption and they will fade away into oblivion, if they had any sense which I doubt, would work with the President to build America that way they may gain some respect
@Henryhahadavis @AZGoodFella2 Good man 👍you definitely told them what for The President is proud of you well done
@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes That’s none of your business period dictatorship is over in Ireland and most other places in the world , I will not be replying to your message regarding this subject in future thank you and have a happy Christmas and happy new year 🎆
@FingalForLife @MaryOGrady8 Mary over the months since the referendum I have been asking young people how they voted in the referendum they nearly all said they voted yes,I also asked would they have an abortion they said no, so why did you vote yes, I asked we don’t have the right to tell others what to do
@Paul_J_Roche @MaryOGrady8 @Irishprolifer Catherine stay safe out there 🍀
@MaryOGrady8 @fiannafailparty That was also a time when there was so much corruption we were in a mess in every area of state politics, County Councils, Planning, Catholic Church, Garda, Tribunals, Women’s rights , we now have a more open society and no hiding places where you will be exposed
@DC_ARVSgt @NCA_UK Sarg. thats a fantastic piece of policing and also great great job by CPS. and Courts will done to all the    I would say the handlers got some shock ha ha
@NomDeVoyage1 @donnia8789 Shame on you heartless people
@BetoORourke @msmadscientist7 Send them all back to where they came from if you want to help them send money to them in their own country, and please stop spreading propaganda, to help the child and drug traffickers as well as the criminals which you’re hiding no one believes you, what is your real interest ?
@JOEdotie Good stuff are you both going to have a good Christmas 🎄 or just one cheers 🥂
@Independent_ie I don’t think the Dublin yellow jackets protesters realize the French are not protesting for socialism, they are protesting for right wing conservatism to take over, since they are hailing Donald Trump as their hero, and chanting ( Trump Trump Trump we want Trump )
@RealMattCouch @JudyMarie4DT Nice one Gary
@reveal @sonicthebadger They are still doing the same thing today shame on them
@rtenews Good luck girls have a great day keep the good work going thank you
@DanMulhall @FrankFeighan Well done guys great company
@StopTrump2020 @jrivera64 @realDonaldTrump Help President Trump make America great again, and don’t be stupid look at who is to blame, the Democrats with their false promises, and their criminal agents in the caravan, build the wall deport them all,
@DrEtiquette @1Davie1 It’s simple the illegal traffickers are criminals and responsible for the child’s death, they were offered asylum in Mexico,  that’s the first country they landed in and that’s where they should apply, that is the law, and not some vote grabbing senators version
@maziehirono @jrivera64 Senator all that’s wrong for you is your lot are being exposed, you’re promoting drug and child trafficking,aiding criminals who have already been deported from the USA for criminality back in, you should be ashamed of yourself, to expose your countrymen to these elements
@PastorJon9 @BoboMarilyn @PatriotNurse1 What a bunch of fraudsters, they are incapable of telling the truth, they lie over and over, there has to be a way to remove these people from office, if you commit perjury in court, you can go to prison, why not put these in prison? They deceived the electorate for their gain
@IrishTimes Casey you’re an ugly dirty thing stop interfering in our country’s lives you are a disgrace to humanity go home to where ever you come from
@SealeyGerald @BobBrinson1 Yes Yes Yes he will as soon as the stupid feeble government gets their medical treatment for whatever is wrong with them, they were suffering from indecision , now they are not so sure , they should be in a nursing home, at least some of them definitely should
@STACEYDUBOIS4 @BobBrinson1 @POTUS @FLOTUS You two are looking well merry Christmas 🎁🎄
@ChuckCallesto I don’t mean to be mean or disrespectful to Nancy P. But she should know her limits, after looking at that press conference she’s clearly not able for her job, souring her words and suffering from indecision is not the way to run a government, clearly she needs to had the retire
@Stevie_63 @Jim_Jordan @blingarama I haven’t said anything negative about Jim Jordan what ever are you talking about
@Boomer_Patriot @frespirit01 @POTUS Well done 👍
@realDonaldTrump @pvtjokerus I’ve saying that for years it’s been abused and used for political reasons and ends, and yes great news, that’s the kind of law changes needed to stop migrant spongers coming as some stated in interviews as reason for coming to the USA
@Jali_Cat @frespirit01 @HillaryClinton @DNC @TheDemocrats @CBP Jali you’re absolutely correct in your assumptions about the cases of the little girl loosing her life, the new low the Democrats have stooped to knows no bounds,  when they caused the situation in the first place, and I believe it will emerge they are behind this caravan??
@JudicialWatch @Clofconnie @realDonaldTrump Obama you’re going to get caught
@thejournal_ie Not long enough time he should have got life for that dirty thing
@robbystarbuck @MARINE_99ZULU @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC @CNN @washingtonpost Yes where is CNN now this is what President Trump is all about Buisness, jobs, growth in the USA economy, taking people out of poverty, not through handouts for something they did not earn, but jobs to give them self respect and purpose in life, and create better communities 👍
@sxdoc @blingarama Well done 👍 President Trump you have to look at the areas where, because of their voting habits, the Democrats have been taking jobs away and allowing areas to run down these people needs your help in bringing balance to their lives thank you
@frfrankpavone @MaryOGrady8 Are you running out of victims
@GOP @TerryKalUSMC @PressSec Well said and you are absolutely correct in your comments the sooner the Democrats step up and do their job and stop trying to score tricks the better it will be for all concerned
@FAIRImmigration @relaxnpensacol1 @onenewsnowcom That’s my point why will they not listen because it suits them

@sharontolan @MOReganIT @FitzgeraldFrncs @MaireadMcGMEP @MariaBaileyFG @ivanabacik @alisonoconn @CharlieFlanagan @joanburton The women we have in politics are doing a fantastic job,the wonderful example given by President Mary Robinson, the women had a hard act to follow, they did, and what a fantastic job they are doing, the girls have opened up the debate across the board with courage and conviction
@TerryKalUSMC The Democrats are proving the fact that they  lie they are hypocrites and they will be exposed, if they don’t get their act together soon they are in danger of destroying their party for good, work together for the good of the country and the people, from a decent opposition
@Lady_Vi_2U @frespirit01 Could Dennis O’Brien find himself doing time in a Federal prison he wouldn’t like that, the bribery laws are very serious in the USA 🇺🇸??
@PekalaLaw @ClwtrBkAtty Probably the Democrats sleepers are behind this round them up deport them
@FuctupMike @JudyMarie4DT The boarder wall will save the nation over $70 billion per year by getting rid of the spongers and the associated expenses
@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes Mary you’re not correct,  you should never take things out of context as it distorts the truth and realty, as part of an abortion there is healthcare for the mother, mental and physical you need to have a little humanity in your words it’s not a nice thing to have an abortion
@donlav @updayIE Good stuff
@marklevinshow It’s hard to believe but you are correct to call her dumb would be promotion from where she is now
@Jali_Cat @PTorney @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @TheDemocrats Yes these are the people Nancy Pelosi sticks up for she wants more like him in the country shame on you Pelosi and your Democrat friends worse to come??

@Education4Libs @SusanHa58439616 Nancy are you for real,  how could you let yourself down this way, are you on the side of drug and child traffickers, criminals from South America demanding $50k per person illegal alien, or perhaps you have $ incomes from this area, if so you will be exposed, shame on you
@PFEW_HQ @PFEW_Chair Sarg I sent you a congrats on receiving that extra funding for the police, thinking it would go into policing and put more police and equipment on the ground, I cannot see why the police should have to pay council tax, they will need to quadruple that they have given you thank U
@rtenews Thank you Catherine you delivered that speech in the Oireachtas with feeling and passion thank you and all the members well done
@belledujour208 @Tesco @AldiUK @Morrisons @sainsburys @LidlUK @MoveTheWorldUK They are published and are available from department of agriculture very strict rules govern their use

@NFitzPsychology @donlav Nianh, Don, Cpt Darby Kennedy who used own Weston Airport had kippers and porridge all his life and look at his century of life in good health
@ukgeol @PeterStefanovi2 @gmcrotty You give the Labour Party to much credit,J C and co are not capable of level of thinking Napoleon was a brilliant and very capable Leader J C is not, Allen Sugar is a Labour supporter has stated JC is the worst leader Labour ever had, I say JC is a great protester not a leader
@Blessttt @1Davie1 Well done , that’s the language we like to hear from you someone with a bit of backbone and broad shoulders and yes build the wall, it will save you billions $ look after your own
@azuretone @blackyellowbrd @stephen_latham @James4Labour @Shambles151 @MerryMichaelW @ToryFibs @jeremycorbyn They do not have the numbers
@brianschatz @donnia8789 There nothing cool about being a Democrat, it’s the last refuge of a scoundrels, you lie, cheat, put out fake news, give refuge to criminals, and drug traffickers, and that’s what you call cool?, you need mental therapy, you poor thing
@ukgeol @PeterStefanovi2 @gmcrotty Well as bad as the Tories at the moment J C and Labour are not even capable of being an opposition they sit there like lost souls, instead of standing and fighting, I don’t know where this will end,
@KatTheHammer1 I agree I believe Barack Obama is a nice man so be a pastor, you need strong powerful Buisness men and Women to see through the fake news and lies as well as the emotional blackmail used by people to get their way, when you give someone something they didn’t earn that’s wrong,
@BobBrinson1 @TinaHoskins11 Absolutely yes true Blue Conservative Do Not know any other way, nothing else works with good leadership, a good General has to take hard and sometimes unpopular decisions to win the battle, it is a mistake to try and please mindless so called do gooders to be popular never works
@PeterStefanovi2 @gmcrotty Rees-Mogg is a foolish person the strongest person in the Conservative party is Theresa May, and well fit for any dizzy comments coming from Jacob Rees-Mogg  who doesn’t seem to be able realize what’s going on let alone to predict the mood of the party
@ScottPresler @JudyMarie4DT Well done guys now you’re getting the message build a prosperous nation and you will get the rewards remembering security and policing is very important do not neglect that

@The_Trump_Train @PTorney @realDonaldTrump President Trump is gaining ground because people are beginning to see through the Democrats lies and fake news it will catch up with those fronting it and drown them good rids country better of without that kind Republicans rebuilding the nation help them, help you
@DeepStateExpose @ThinkUPositive1 Surely The police can track these thugs down and lock them up for a very long time, there should be no hiding place and the police should spend what ever it takes to find these cowards, this is what the Democrats are breeding o my god
@LifeNewsHQ @harborgirl21 Get out your a criminal and a druggy get out stay out don’t come back

@rtenews @MaryOGrady8 @RSAIreland Congratulations Maurice you deserve as many awards as the country bestow on you, you’re a hero thank goodness your looking well after your ordeal , good luck and enjoy your retirement, and what ever you do in future, Bless you and your family happy Xmas
@KimStrassel @McBride8 An educated man should know the difference between right and wrong,also difference between truth and lies and should also know there are consequences if one does the wrong thing
@marklevinshow @McBride8 The Democrats are disgusting and disgraceful all consumed with hate and negativity, dressed up In lambs clothing for image purposes when in the background they support the criminal caravan, drug dealers, people trafficking, illegal aliens, fake news and god knows what else ????
@PeterMurtagh @WWinters_ Peter if you have a problem with the best friends you have in Europe ie the Irish, you’re insecure, there is nothing but good will in Ireland for the UK, we have a conservative government working together with other partners to stabilize our economy, likeTheresa May is for you
@RodStryker @TerryGHenderso1 Yes (build the wall deport them all) that should be the chorus of all statements made about the migrants and illegal aliens , and support for President Trump, now the chorus (build the wall deport them all )
@Independent_ie Well done Quick thinking Garda what you did won the day thank you
@mozandy @Clofconnie @dbongino @realDonaldTrump I would agree with that, they have the wrong mindset and you cannot rehabilitate those people with teraphy they are brainwashed, pity
@RebekahWorsham @1Davie1 If that were the case half of the past Presidents would be in the same boat, stop bickering and get on with your life and make your mark on the world with productivity not depravity and your rewards will be greater, be positive smile and the world will smile with you
@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes Could you Guys get on with your laves and put our time and energy into  something useful the amendment is over and decided and it will be signed into law , pick a subject like women children been abused in the home, rape, bullying these are things you can do something about 👍
@realDonaldTrump @TerryKalUSMC Yes President Trump get the military to do the job, then let Americans know how useless the Democrats really are, and how little they care about your nations security, It will keep you in the White House for another term good luck 👍

@SarahPalinUSA @frespirit01 Good woman nice to see you’re broad minded attitude thank you Bless you and good luck
@MaryOGrady8 @jowens00 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes I voted yes in the referendum, not for abortion as i would not want any of my family to have an abortion, however I am also a supporter of women’s equality and writes I voted for a women to chose what she wants for herself, and not to be dictated to by church,state, or men
@Grannyjob @PTorney @AMike4761 I absolutely agree with you
@lovebothireland @MaryOGrady8 @SimonHarrisTD What ever are you talking about there is nothing being railroaded through the Dail  the will of the people is being carried out in accordance with the law that’s what happens in a democracy, you don’t have to participate it you so wish
@IrishTimes Bishop the law of the land is the law, and it will be obeyed, religious leaders also must obey the law,
@MaryOGrady8 @AnnetteDonnel11 @IrishTimes Sadly I knew of a well off father of a girl who got pregnant and had a baby, her father paid £900 to the Catholic Church to sweep this under the table, when this lady was dying and in her eighties, was crying where is my baby I wonder what happened to him that’s so sad not easy
@Gloria_I_Chavez @Clofconnie @CBPElCentro Well done guys nice job a little bit of hard time now for the next lesson
@AnnetteDonnel11 @MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimes Yes I agree the state was run by the Catholic Church who in turn bullied god fearing and brain washed people into doing what they were told yes the state was to blame, but mostly the Catholic Church, to threat those unmarried young mothers and their babies that way, shame on you
@pvtjokerus @Clofconnie Well said friend
@ChuckCallesto Maxine get a life look around you, the criminals support you ever wonder why?
@J_man_chicago What a stupid comment the country is forging ahead who do you think is responsible for that, some visitors the moon 🌙

@RorysStories Well done guys 👍🍾
@Independent_ie That Bishop should be charged with inciting people to break the law, how dare you,
@SimonZebo Simon you have met your match with that little cutie she wins, well done Simon 👍🏉
@DC_ARVSgt Yes Sarg you get it in one, the only thing these so-called advisors should offer, is moral support and say thank you for the job you do and risk your lives for us every day, and leave policing to the trained experts, the Police thank you 🙏
@freedom_moates @ClwtrBkAtty @EmmanuelMacron What ever it takes, what ever the price,  clear the streets protect property, help the police restore law and order,  declare marshal law you cannot allow the rule of law to be broken in this way
@AnnaApp91838450 @1Davie1 @BreitbartNews The agent should have shot the assailant in self defense
@Trump454545 @BoboMarilyn Must disappoint the Democrats, more fake news
@Jenn198523 @1Davie1 That reporter was making matters worse for the police, get off the streets you fool,
@DrMartyFox @1Davie1 The border wall is absolutely needed and patrolled with a heavy hand with no mercy for illegal intruders make those who do wished they didn’t
@JudicialWatch @1Davie1 Now what Democrats how about that wake up
@RazorPack65 @1Davie1 You were on the street protesting your on camera run away go home when you look for trouble sometimes it will find you
@bbusa617 @1Davie1 Deport them, all they will do is breed more wasters, then you’re country is doomed, you will have civil war do something now before it’s to late
@codeofvets @harborgirl21 Your country has a huge responsibility and owes gratitude and respect as well as support to all veterans, you ask them to do a dangerous job, they have done their side now it’s up to you do yours, a lot of vets look physically okay, a lot are mentally not okay step up duty calls
@ChuckCallesto @ClwtrBkAtty I wish people would get on with their lives for once, and try to mend   fences across the board, instead of looking for the bad in each other to score tricks, people voted for you work for their good, and improve lives, please respect each other’s views work together, for the USA
@Raguleader @charliekirk11 @jonhsanders2 No but the living person who used their vote would need to be worried
@Independent_ie Well minister you have the power to do something about this injustice you replace the person who made this decision as they are not fit for purpose, is this not unfair dismissal? Is it legal?
@bbusa617 @jonhsanders2 More corruption expose all this corruption, publish and televise it with the same aggression as the Democrats do with their fake news making sure you be truthful and accurate, that will hurt and they will loose all credibility
@charliekirk11 @jonhsanders2 America needs to investigate voter fraud the most powerful country in the world has to be able to put a system in place to track these dead voters and prosecute those who do so with stiff prison time it will make people think twice,
@Independent_ie There is something seriously wrong with RTE if they are not renewing Martina Fitzgerald’s contract, it needs to be investigated who made the decision and why, is there a hidden agenda if so root it out and expose the villain, Martina does a great job we need answers
@Education4Libs @SusanHa58439616 Put them high security prison that has a chain gang, then put them building the wall for a couple of years then deport them I believe you have to get the organization trafficking these migrants, before it’s to late
@kimusastrong @donnia8789 Shame on them I mean the UN
@The_Trump_Train @relaxnpensacol1 Yes good idea bring it on ASAP
@DC_ARVSgt @ProtectRPolice Yes Sarg you have to let your superior mind make allowances for the political mind,as it often said politics is the last refuge of a scoundrels, you on the other hand have to take all these deficiencies into account good luck stay safe
@punkpuffin @bagofcows @alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn I also live 40% in UK and have contributed to the UK economy for 40 odd years and still do, my MP advised me to vote as I did, he majority in the UK voted as I did
@DC_ARVSgt @ProtectRPolice Politics stay out of policing, legislate then leave it to the police to enforce the law their way, as they are the experts, supply the police with their needs, ie safety attire, transport, equipment, and moral support good luck Guys
@PSNIBelfastW Some sickness in a uninformed idiot that should be in a mental hospital with nothing going on in this culprit life poor things, it’s all they could attack the dead, the cowards could not face one of those war dead alive, love to apprehend them and put their photos all over media
@bagofcows @alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn Richard I hope you are correct, In that case Ireland should leave as well and alli with the UK
@JOEdotie And so say all of us,  the HSE cannot be fixed
@spin1038 Well done Garda fantastic news
@bagofcows @alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn I agree,  so the UK should be sitting strongly at the top table steading and steering the ship instead of running away and allowing the others to do as they wish, although I live in Ireland I have a vote the UK (I voted for Brexit) I did not have the facts as it’s turned out
@alexgordon4me @blackyellowbrd @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn It has always been a socialist Europe that’s the problem can he not see it’s changing they are all turning right what papers are you reading man
@OregonJOBS2 I would have to say bad parenting there are ways of dealing with this problem, and not creating another making her walk 5 miles to school is also a form of bullying so you are teaching her bullying works, instead teach her how to respect,conduct, and communicate with others 👍
@JOEdotie This lady proves my point that the political establishment in the UK has lost it’s way, with wild statements like hers, food shortages in Ireland we are huge exporters of food billions of euro per year because of our high standards, she also forgets we are staying in The EU
@blackyellowbrd You can put on what ever color vest you wish,if you do not have political leadership fit for purpose you will not succeed, at present the Labour Party is almost non existent no backbone or leadership Jeremy C. What is the matter with you man, if you have a medical problem say so
@OrgPhysics @patrick_emmet That’s what started these stories and myths in olden times
@Independent_ie The problem with this dispute is one saw himself as the looser and over time kept building up to an explosion which is what happened, one should be aware of ones actions on others in this case you have two families destroyed,  there are no winners, all losers
@DermotCosgrove Another vixen will fed in very good condition
@Ana21066852 @Clofconnie Fantastic to see what you did Rodney your the kind of people we need more of in the world today not asking what others can do for you but what we can do for others Bless you and your family Rodney thank you 👍

@Independent_ie Good to see you looking so good Peter with that good looking girl on your arm, good luck 👍
@ZonePhysics @EoinBearla I did that years ago in Finland however I could never pick it up it always broke with the slit est touch
@LybergIngrid @colettebrowne That’s outrageous when you see figures like that put before you,one never realized the extent of the problem, I get slammed sometimes for being a supporter of women’s rights and equality, it is all about respect and equality I said only look down on someone to admire their shoes
@JOEdotie What a clever women who stated  she would not welcome  UK into their block as she stated the UK would mess things up for them,the way they messed things for themselves in the UK, what is needed is a practical political leader to lead the country and stop listening to the clowns
@IWiIlkaga All of the liberals propaganda will come back to haunt them, they will loose all credibility when the truth is revealed, if you listen and believe what they say and it turns out false you have contributed to the problem be careful what you wish for
@zerohedge @IWiIlkaga Please stop trying to provoke people sit down and talk, diplomacy is the best policy, it will end up there anyway, so why not start there saving a lot of waste and time, make better friends with less adverse to overcome in future, like my mom said little said is easily to mended
@JohnSimpsonNews John absolutely correct some people will never learn, don’t have that ability sadly, they have a lack of education more importantly a lack of respect for their fellow man, if one does not have respect for others, you do not earn respect, the Plutocracy and Plebs  are long gone
@DermotCosgrove Was she invited? looks like a vixen
@donlav Yes Don a lot of people sometimes forget about the sacrifices that the Russians made in WW11 lost lives whole families wiped out they are worthy of remembrance thank you
@JebBush @USNavy @flynavy Fair play to the US Navy you never forget your own, great respect from fellow aviators, and also a time to remember George’s eight fellow aviators who lost their lives on that mission and never returned praise the lord for their sacrifice and lives may they rest in piece amen 🙏
@thejournal_ie Yes Leo it’s been out of step for a long time, the people in the front line nurses doctors will do their job and do it well, unfortunately there are other people in the health service the HSE who are not fit for purpose who see themselves as more important than the Medics, ? P45
@NewstalkFM Well said I agree think about the women and their lives and respect their wishes that is what we voted for and not for these fee loaders who are trying to make a name for themselves respect a women’s right to make her own decisions
@IWiIlkaga @RockyRidgesPal Don’t be stupid, some people will say anything I often wonder what they use for brains sadly they don’t have any
@SkyNews @IWiIlkaga School children as you call them ?, look like teenagers can also be rioters if they were at home they would not have this problem
@SarahPalinUSA @IWiIlkaga She is a criminal and she proved that fact herself
@charliekirk11 @ThinkUPositive1 That’s why they are Known as the spongers party Take Take Take give ?? Nothing, that’s why they want the Mexico Caravan migrants, more spongers to swell their number, get out and work earn a living,  USA be on alert watch out for trouble from the left

@DC_ARVSgt Fantastic job Judge we need more like you in the world praise the lord for your firmness and conversation you have the courage to act as you should respect for authority and the law has to be protected, where it is not there has to be a consequence for that disrespectful attitude
@thejournal_ie Now step up and help your Garda when you want the Garda their ready to help you now you help the Garda that’s the decent thing to do
@RTErugby Two fantastic people and two fantastic rugby players good luck guys keep up the great work that keeps us smiling you did it all you did it your way thank you 😊
@AmoneyResists @FoxNews @TomiLahren You are correct if they are allowed in more will come, do not allow any of these migrants in, you will have untold problems in future, they are not law abiding people,these people are not refugees they have admitted so they are looking for work and handouts like healthcare,cop on
@Independent_ie Sue the union
@IrishTimes And rightly so support the Garda not the criminals when will you learn probably never
@IrishTimes Well done to the honorable Mary Robinson congratulations on receiving your award, you brought credibility to everything you have been involved in you broke new ground so that others could follow you broke down barriers and created space so that others could flourish, Bless you
@Jamwall7 Well done Garda that’s the way to get their attention good luck,
@ChiefSuptStaffs Yes CH. Super. You guys need to do that no matter what the costs, ignoring the goody two shoes, and misguided supposedly humanitarians, who don’t know the meaning of the word good luck and stay safe
@MarkMyWordsJCPM @blackyellowbrd You stated you want a Labour government to change things if so Labour needs a new leader as it is they cannot form an effective opposition let alone govern, as bad as things are now wait for Brexit when wages will drop 9%, Labour sitting idly by stand up J.C. Do something
@HangBlaa Yes John I agree I’ve been saying that all alone wait for the next election punish those time wasters then 👍
@rtepolitics @rtenews @RTENewsNow Well Done Dail democracy at work thank you
@colettebrowne I don’t know where or what you’re basing your information on, a cow in Germany, France, The UK or Ireland all forgive me (Farts) the same way however cattle and other farm livestock out number the people in Ireland to a greater extent than other countries, they use our produce
@MrKennethClarke Yes Ken I have to agree with you, I see Boris as a man-child great fun but without an ounce of sense it’s not fair to the British people to represented in this way, if he wishes to carry on this way do it on speakers  corner, not in the honorable House of Parliament, My Goodness
@GaryLineker My goodness where is all this going the country is falling apart and no one seems to give a dam I am a great supporter of Mrs May but for now she doesn’t seem to be listening to the people what a mess, bring back Margret Tatcher, O sorry she passed away, pity
@Independent_ie Good to see all these bogus claims being rejected by the courts and in particular the Judges in these cases taking a more practical reason for the actions of the claimants as to the cause of a would be accident
@realDonaldTrump @IWiIlkaga Makes economic sense to me
@Nigelrefowens And rightly so Nigel you will bring a new dimension to the match good luck 👍
@eliistender10 Yes
@charliekirk11 @McBride8 It’s hard to argue with that as I said before, but people will always invent a reason when they are trying to sell something and others will believe because they want to whether its true or false , it’s all about mind games, and the personality of the seller, a flaw in the brain
@Independent_ie My friends bag was placed on The checked in luggage at Dublin airport when he got to London his bag had been opened and valuable items stolen when it arrived on the caracole he had nothing to hide, fool why wouldn’t you object to having your valuables stolen, are you stupid??
@MSNBC It’s not a good idea to stage something that is a lie as it diminishes ever thing you say I listened to all those young men in the caravan stating they were not refugees they wanted to work in the USA others said they were already deported from the USA for criminality I ask you??
@FrankFeighan @FineGael Congrats and best wishes to you three good luck 👍

@IrishTimes I believe the HSE should concentrate on other things what a load rubbish it is the most natural thing in the world to use words of endearment to people who are hurt or suffering as a way of calming them, what do you want robots, have you ever heard of bedside manner? Get a life
@NewstalkFM David they will listen to you, and many thanks for your teachings bringing the love and wonderment of the natural world to our tv screen, I have learned so much from you about endangered species, the effect we humans are having on our natural world, climate change etc good luck

@GMPFederation @Reciprocity5904 Well done police officers one and all what about having police on smaller motorbikes that can go where the thieves go down narrow lanes and through barriers, working along side the cars?

@TommyBowe14 @eirSport Yes Tommy you’re correct cheers mate
@policecommander There has to be accountability on the parents of these mindless criminal teenagers the courts,and in particular the Judges,have to hand drawn much stiffer custodial sentence to anyone who assaults a police officer on duty, and ignore the goody two shoes pleas, he’s a good kid ah.
@DubFireBrigade Thank you
@IrishTimesBiz I was a great friend to An Tasice for a great number of years I believe it has lost its way, interfering in house, and other planning for no legitimate reason, it has been taken over by fanatics that do nothing except add cost to projects it unlike the The National Trust in UK
@DubFireBrigade Visiting some weeks ago and I saw what looked like two fire alarms on their living room ceiling i mentioned the idea of having two fire alarms, o no one is a carbon monoxide alarm I informed her the carbon monoxide alarm should be close to the floor, answer my god we didn’t know
@HMcEntee Helen Thank you we would like to know the names of these TDs and at the next election make them suffer idiots
@policecommander @Reciprocity5904 Absolutely fantastic reaction lovely to see the reaction looking at the leg and then the he loving hugs then she was a celebrity, lovely to see ❤️
@IrishTimes That juror should be prosecuted and banned from Jury service for life
@FT @donlav What is the UK doing to its self a wonderful country being destroyed by its own government and politics can’t anyone help an old friend this is self mutuality, you taught the world how about taking a leaf out of your own book, it’s time to think and reflect
@IrishTimes Heart filled sorrow for you and your family at the loss of your sister and daughter, delighted that thing got life now if he ever comes up for parole contest it good luck bless you
@HealingMB @patrick_emmet It never fails sit on a river bank listening to the water flowing over rocks in a constant relaxing rhythm or a little waterfall making its own tune without a music 🎶 sheet or conductor to guide its identity isn’t nature wonderful
@ladyhaja Well said girl and the cowards walked out which proves your point not man enough to face you, you’re the winner, they are nothing
@NewstalkFM Good thank you Judge and Jury

@sportsdes @rtenews Des leave the comedy to Tommy T The Navan man, he was only looking for Dolphins Barn
@JiffyRugby @itvnews Your absolutely correct we can’t hang him but we sure as hell can give him life
@NCA_RoyMcComb @Reciprocity5904 That Bastard should get like without parole
@Independent_ie President Trump was correct these migrants are trouble, they do not respect the rule of law, they put their women and children in the path of danger to achieve their goals, to invade the USA using the humanity ticket, protect your country from future problems keep them out
@Independent_ie Should have been 10 years your victim gets life remembering you sick animal piece of nothing
@CallMeFebel @RepBarbaraLee @DebbieGT18 @UN Your taking things out of context keep all the house or home parts together, and keep all the state or country parts together, then it will make sense, it’s a parable, Bless you
@Independent_ie Well done Judge and Jury now you’re getting it right many thanks
@CallMeFebel @RepBarbaraLee @DebbieGT18 @UN I believe your country is your home and needs to be protected in lots of ways, pollution, law and order, invasion, needs of the citizens, healthcare, education, in a democracy you are policed and governed by Consent to protect all this, if this fails you have anarchy get my point
@bennyjohnson That Guy Jim Acosta is a disgrace to journalism he has only one thing on his mind not right or wrong it’s President Trump, the criminals from South America don’t bother him so long as he can twist the news to his advantage he is not interested in the rule of law, a fantastic?
@RepBarbaraLee @DebbieGT18 @UN If a criminal is trying to break into your home you will shut the gate or door and call the police, in this case the people who rushed the border post got teargas thrown at them by law inforcement protecting themselves from these criminals I would hate to have you in security
@MikeLevinCA @msmadscientist7 Try not sensualize a situation for your own selfish reason, dramatics is for Hollywood if you have something to sell spell it out
@IrishTimesWorld That’s the best statement to none Trump (they are not getting in ) they are hardline criminals load them on Planes  Buses or  Trains and ship them back to where they came from or seek asylum in Mexico
@lionsofficial @IrishRugby Never thought I would ever see the day all I can say wow 57 years when I started to play 🏉 how things have changed from muddy provincial fields to the world 😲
@thejournal_ie That’s what the border agents have to do protect their borders from undesirables,  as these people have proven they are ready to break the law and invade your country think what they would do if they got in invade your homes ?
@Independent_ie The Garda Commissioner and the Garda do their job it’s the Courts that has to do theirs better, a rapist should NOT get a suspended sentence weather he pleads guilty or not he may plead guilty to get a reduced sentence, prison that sends a message to the would be rapist yes Judge
@RebekahWorsham The USA has no alternative but to protect itself from invasion from where ever it comes where these people come from they do not respect the rule of law, they have to be stopped stay in Mexico you are already there, I believe they are trouble makers as they have already proved
@JohnnySexton Johnny there is no need to be speechless you deserve everything you are getting your are a hero thank you 🙏
@Ukusaaus @amber_athey President Trump stated that the caravan had criminal elements and undesirables traveling in convoy the goody two shoes got all fired up about humanity and the law, the law is only afforded to law abiding people, these people clearly are not, do not create a problem for the future
@amber_athey @Ukusaaus Who the hell do they think they are that’s an attack on the USA an attempted invasion what do they expect it proved one thing they are not law abiding people maybe Trump was right
@farrahsafiakhan @JMGayton1 Don’t be stupid let them get asylum in the first country they arrive in that is the law and they have no right to cross another country to get asylum in less you are saying Mexico is not safe?
@VinaigretteGirl @DanKaszeta What kind of mother would expose her children to this they rushed border of another country waving a foreign flag and then look for sympathy they’re in Mexico get asylum there the USA didn’t want them this caravan is a form of bullying if you cannot negotiate your way go back
@RTErugby @rtenews Sorry to loose you Joe your the best welcome on board Andy and good luck
@SeanOReganIRL @donlav You are correct the people who abuse women are nothings they are so insignificant in the world all they can do is bully because they are unable to stand up to stronger people well there should be no hiding place for them in law or elsewhere expose and jail them and-shun them
@WorldRugby Congrats Rory you are a great ambassador for Rugby for Ulster for Irish Rugby we are so proud of you my goodness what a fantastic year your had with all the other honorable attributes you received how do beat that good luck to you and your family a legend in your lifetime wow
@IrishTimes Many thanks for the loan of the art work sorry about the idiot who splashed the paint
@JJRyan64 @thejournal_ie Yes WW1 / WW11 my mother was a nurse in UK during WW11 lots of Irish people fought lost loved ones those who survived were affected  my mother in particular wouldn’t talk about it except to say some of the badly wounded soldiers were only kids crying for their moms as they died?
@enr56 @patrick_emmet What a horrible person to have as a priest has to be Catholic pedophile sick to treat children like that he should be prosecuted for assault its hard for me to believe this could happen Today I won’t go any further
@rugby_ie @thejournal_ie That’s it Johnny the world has decided what we already knew you are the greatest we are so proud of you good luck in joy your break cheers
@RTErugby Congratulations Joe you are the best thanks a billion Bless you and you deserve the award 🥇

@DF_COS @donlav @UN @defenceforces Well done Army and Navey as well as law enforcement ie Garda a time to remember all those who lost their lives I cannot see why RIC are not remembering as the were all citizens of Ireland who lost their lives
@GillenM_ @ThePaulColton The Haka is a battle cry and an invitation to battle I have played Rugby for 27 years you don’t have to be sorry no one said it was a religious victory and my god is my Buisness it is people like you that create controversy where there is none have you nothing to occupy your time
@rte @RTEdoconone Please respect the rule of law I am not making Judgment on what they did or did not do a Jury of their piers found them not guilty an honorable Judge stated they were free to go, I am a strong supporter of women’s rights and have nothing but contempt for rapist, respect the law
@DearAuntCrabby @DebbieGT18 Aunt you voted him into office did you not know what you were doing??
@thejournal_ie Yes we are O yes we are that green army of Rugby players the best in the world 🌎 thank you lads 🙏
@ThePaulColton Yes Reverend sometimes a gesture speaks a thousand words like that step taken in unity we earned a lot of respect for our performance and we were all friends at the end, well that’s Rugby 🏉 making friends staying friends bless them
@ThePaulColton Reverend they might be better taking a lead out of our book and save their energy as the war dance had no effect on Dr Rory and the squad, what a day one of the best days of my life praise the lord for the Irish team thank you 🙏 guys
@opwireland @ThePaulColton @rtenews @VisitDublin @IrishTimes @Independent_ie @VirginMediaNews @VirginMedia_One @TG4TV @RTERayDarcyShow @TodaySOR @kevinboxermoran I can’t believe how these mindless insane people could did this it is so disrespectful to the people who gave their lives on the battlefield who came from towns all over this country praise the lord for their sacrifice may they Rest In Peace 🙏
@BrianODriscoll Brian I hope Johnny gets player of the year one never knows, I was sure you would get when it went to Richie Mc one never knows
@Arron_banks @Ukusaaus Theresa May will not abandon any one not a nice way to conduct yourself that kind of nonsense doesn’t help think of something positive to say what the heck has the Falkland to do with Europe they’re British not belonging to Argentina
@Labour4EU @VinaigretteGirl Mrs May will not budge on Gibraltar it is British and British it will stay
@dontbrexitfixit @theresa_may Thank you Theresa May with your stance on Gibraltar 🇬🇮I go there a lot
@IrishTimes Yes President  Micheal D Higgins I agree no matter where it is at home or in far away countries it needs to be tackled some sick people think they have a right to to abuse women and girls and treat them as less important than men we should use trade sanctions to protect women
@UlsterRugby @Stuart_Mc12 @JCooney09 @Jordimurphy @robert_herring2 @WillAddisonB3 @HendersonIain Proud of you Guys looking well good luck and stay safe 👍
@thejournal_ie And why not Fine Gael is and always was a decent honest party and with Leo and team at the helm brings humanity and compassion as well as care for everyone to the table corruption is being stamped out, young people are supporting FG and they are they ones who matter the future ☘️
@Independent_ie It’s about time Clever Judges put a stop to these fraudulent claims these people are making a living out of accidents and exaggerated medical conditions, they have to be exposed this man should go to prison, praise the lord for the Judge and the Barrister in this case
@TommyBowe14 Tommy thank you as ever for your contributions to our Rugby family what a year we had and what a distance we have comes from in my early playing years when we had to look twice at who you were tackling as we were all covered in mud we all looked the same,  good luck take care 👍
@at_RIN @marklanebiz @ron_eisele @AviateAddict It’s deafening but what an amazing aircraft and imagine it was used as a bomber in the Falklands campaign only one still flying although i am told there are others that could
@DailyMailUK Nine months not enough should have been two years
@IrishRugby Yes
@rtenews Well done Leo and don’t forget Micheal Ring a fantastic champion for the west move more people to the west and now the road to Sligo and Mayo needs to be a duel carriage way to attract Buisness and people
@TommyBowe14 Tommy Angry all blacks won’t bother you or Conor we really did beat them wow 😲 and the Green line took a step forward,  Haka what? Cheers
@IrishTimesSport Yes the black war dance didn’t intimidate  Dr. Rory and the green Giants with one step forward there was more to come the spell was broken if their ever was one? Praise the lord for you all you made my year Xmas cannot be better it’s been out classed thank you 🙏 Guys
@IrishTimes The way a girl is dressed no matter how desirable sexually attractive she is if that makes her feel good well done girls, that’s nothing to do with rape, a rapist is a sick sycophantic abusive criminal and sexual thief there should be no hiding place for them in law or elsewhere
@DanRather @msmadscientist7 Did you know gardeners of old nurtured ladybirds as they controlled  green fly and other garden insects 🐞
@rtenews I don’t know what the Spanish are complaining about the Spanish controls two parts of Morocco namely Melilla and Ceuta do they want to give these territories up I don’t believe so the residents of Gibraltar want to stay as they are, after all its only a rock 3 miles by 2
@crimesofbrits @donlav Well there are pros and cons I have been very interested in Easter Island 🗿 for a very long time I have become aware of of the Polynesian people the Rapa Nui as a result of seeing the large statue in the British Museum and they have earned a lot of respect as a result of this

@campaignforleo @Failte_Ireland I was amazed the amount of visitors who came to the west coast of Sligo to Surf I was in Strand-hill and Easkey  and met Surfers from all over the world they said some of the Surfing in the world was on The Sligo coastal waters, good to see Leo and government taking notice tks.
@rtenews Trump it is an invasion they’re in Mexico let them get asylum in Mexico and Trump should close the border it is crazy to allow those people to impose their will on another country Mexico allowed them in now look after them you have to protect your borders
@donlav Yes you guys the crew of the William B Yates you all look great, good luck and stay safe happy sailing
@PFEW_HQ @PFEW_Chair I absolutely agree with you, you need to increase police numbers greatly also you need to have very stiff penalties ie prison and fines and any disrespectful behavior towards a police on duty needs to be addressed before it’s two late the government needs to act now
@NewstalkFM That’s the stuff you need to dish out to thugs now arrest them and charge them 🙏
@Independent_ie What an idiot you want someone to pay for your stupidity get a life
@charlottehelenb @gmcrotty It will never happen something always comes up to fix a problem when it arrives that is the way of the world 🌎
@NiamhoNiamh @rte I could listen to Professor Brian Cox for ever he has a unique way of explaining his knowledge and making one listen and observe its a gift also watched him on his tv programs/documentaries well done 👍
@Antcon7062 @gmcrotty If the Kerry GAA had an ounce of sense that player/member should be drummed out of the organization what a role model thug to have in their team I believe the DPP should appeal that decision he should go to prison, it sends a wrong message to people who assaults a Garda
@IrishTimes He should have got and served the four years a coward will always be a coward
@MichealMartinTD This vandalism was done by some one without a single brain cell it’s disgusting our fellow citizens who died an that mad war and now some idiot disrespecting their memory and sacrifice shame on you who ever you are
@MallowNews @donlav Don’t make me sick

@campaignforleo That’s a fantastic idea now you will get houses constructed
@WorldRugby Johnny Sexton what a man number one
@sturdyAlex @VinaigretteGirl What people forget is Theresa May did not decide to take the UK out of the EU the people of the UK voted to leave and being the head of government it is her job and duty to carry out the will of the people and the law this is democracy like it or not
@IrishRugby @JohnnySexton @claire_mol Congratulations Johnny you deserve it well done Mate you had a fantastic rugby 🏉 year thank you so very much ☘️🏉
@Independent_ie That sentence in my opinion is not good enough I believe once a tug always a tug do not blame the drink it only releases what’s in him, it sends a wrong message to others if you assault a Garda on duty you should go to prison being a GAA player or wholly joe doesn’t wash with me
@UlsterRugby @RoryBest2 Lovely to see you three, Rory you fully deserve your OBE and you are the most successful Irish rugby captain and a great Ulster Man, we beat the all-blacks wow, we are very proud of you and the guys, you are an absolute gentleman it was nice to see the family in Landsdowne road
@Robert71334755 @campaignforleo When he stated Ireland stands in solidarity with you, that’s the people and the nation of Ireland that’s how we communicate through the head of government who we elected to do the job and to communicate on our behalf
@campaignforleo Yes Leo that’s nice from you and the Irish nation a lot of people have lost their lives thank you
@IrishTimes Of course the officer is entitled to other countries do this all the time it is a very good idea
@OnePoliceUK They should get at least 5 years in prison pressure needs to be put on the CPS to come down hard on these thugs if you don’t you will have problems good luck
@Zara_brown790 I remember in Ireland if a Garda was assaulted in the course of their duty the perpetrator got an automatic prison sentence that needs to come back the courts need to hand down stiffer custodial sentences for assaults on police officers instead a judge saying don’t do that again
@thejournal_ie Lock him up for life sicko
@doglab @Reciprocity5904 Nice one guys that turtle will be telling her friends about the couple of friends she meet on the beach 🏖 cheers guys 👍

@roisiningle Well done Girl you probably saved some one else many thanks and good luck
@belledujour208 Replying to Darren  A razor blade is sharp but can’t cut down a tree An axe is strong and sharp but can’t cut hair We are all important in our own unique ways So never look dawn on anyone unless you are admiring their shoes
@belledujour208 Staying Positive does not mean that things will turn out okay Rather it is knowing that Your will be okay no matter how things turn out. So stay positive
@thejournal_ie Unless a persons underwear had the rapist DNA on them and Garda forensics had examined them as evidence to prove the case of rape they should not be shown, as a person who served on a jury in a rape case I felt very sorry for the girl as she was very stressed I didn’t sleep well
@BenjySarlin @msmadscientist7 You cannot allow politics and political party’s to get in the way of securing your borders like it or not you have to turn those migrants away if you allow this lot in more will come and will be a threat to your country
@InformedOps @JMGayton1 @LisaHJorgensen @MsABalakrishnan @LawTimes I would not ever agree to have convicted criminals on a jury it would be ludicrous and stupid and dangerous no way
@cooper_m @rugbyworldcup @MattRCNM @Tomas_OLeary @LiamToland7 @lstwrd @TodayFM No Matt we are not getting ahead of ourselves we are one of the top Rugby nations and that’s a fact
@thejournal_ie Yes Richard I agree more wind farms please
@IrishRugby @JohnnySexton It absolutely was a fantastic total team effort with a green fence across the pitch and no where to escape and when one did was captured and put back where they supposed to be and told  (don’t do that again) or else

@rtenews We in Ireland have a golden opportunity because of our location on the globe with westerly winds flowing across the Atlantic to build wind farms to drive our railways, and our factories without importing oil or coal or gas cutting down carbon and cutting our balance of payments
@rte @RTEOne @RTEplayer Morris you better wash that hand thoroughly and let him know confessing or shaking hands doesn’t wipe away the sin or the shame he brought on himself, he was put in a position of trust he failed miserably far from achieving the highest rank he is now relegated to the lowest
@BrianODriscoll @WorldRugby Brian I couldn’t agree more as we saw on Saturday not even a yellow card my my

@Channel4News Gordon Brown is making sense
@IrishTimesOpEd Jeremy Corbyn capability’s doesn’t extend that far there is effectively no opposition in the house at this time when ever he does speak it contributes nothing to the debate and causes even more confusion he looks as he would rather be somewhere else??

@tomhappens Well done 👍
@TheLooseH Nice one 👍🏉
@Independent_ie Joe the reason why the head of the HSE or a Bishop well not come on is they would not be able to answer your questions like Tony OBrian all he could do is, like a bold child, O it wasn’t me and blame someone else the same with the Bishop some fairytale answer with no logic
@Independent_ie Long over due it’s about time people woke up to these crazy payouts like the Luas €500k for someone committing an offense there should be no more payouts for anyone hurt doing something illegal people should be held responsible for their own actions instead of rewarding them ??
@rtenews That’s a sad but loving episode in ones life heroes one and all Rip
@McDonaghDJ @PierceKennedy David I have blocked Pierce Kennedy as I do not like the way he speaks or his attitude I most definitely will not be answering anything he has to say he sounds like a person with a grudge
@IrishTimesWorld yes Jo you are to be commended for your stand we were promised things that could not be delivered how were we to know voting yes would lead to this where is the labor leader now sitting on the fence as usual I think he is more of a protester than leader
@EmmanuelMacron Nice to see you guys together thank you praise the lord for the lives and heroic contribution the bravery and sacrifice of our fallen heroes as well as those on the other side let it be a lesson for us all less we forget

@IrishTimesOpEd It’s good to have some of the caliber and experience of Leo Varadkar at the head of government as a doctor he has the essentials needed to see the fears of people and bring a calming effect to situations given a little time and patience we will get there good luck Leo no.1👍🇮🇪

@PaulDHeenan @thejournal_ie What Hitler did in Germany was not legal proved by the Nuremberg trials, slavery was not legal in US Abraham Lincoln made it illegal, legality has everything to do with right &amp; wrong legal is right illegal is wrong the rule of law is what we live by, otherwise we have anarchy

@IrishTimesPol I hope you’re wrong Mary, I hope people have learned a lot more about each other’s ways and respect each other’s traditions and values, I visited the Orange Orders heritage center and on that day there was bus load of Catholic children from Crossmaglen there now that’s progress
@rava_ian Still looking well and still going strong what a legend and what a fantastic rugby player truly a gentleman Doctor Rory Best good luck keep well bless you 👍

@BabiesTuam @donlav I for one would like that, they lived without love,they died with no one to hug them or love them,they were discarded like trash Bishop Doran of Elfin take notice, the next time you try to promote your cause, and their mothers cried for the rest of their lives do you care, no
@BAESystemsAir @donlav @BrooklandsMuseu @Shuttleworth_OW @BAESystemsplc @RoyalAirForce @RAFMUSEUM And the Hurricane shot down more enemy than the Spitfire amazing 👍
@Independent_ie That’s exactly what he did he picked a subject that he could do nothing about as President and it did fire people up with unhelpful statements the only one to gain out of that was Casey you can’t condone that type of gutter politics but then that is what Casey is all about shame
@IrishTimesOpEd The Catholic Church can never escape from sex and abuse scandals they would like the media to stay quiet and not expose them so they could carry on in their wicked ways the median as a responsibility to expose the abuse no more if there are clergy like that go work in a Sex club
@IrishTimes Not long enough
@Independent_ie If one looks at that photo OBrian looks like frightened little man child

@IrishTimes Good man you have to go back a long way
@pmdfoster @SiCarswell It’s becoming clear Dominic Raab has no regard for the UK or it’s wellbeing
@SiCarswell @FT @FinancialTimes Will he ever learn I suppose some people have a limited amount of grey matter in their brain use what little you have to make better sense be a member of the plutocracy if you wish however be mindful the plebes no longer live in caves and communicate on stone tablets
@Independent_ie I congratulate Stephen Teap on your approach to to the awful loss of a loved one you acted with dignity on the other hand you have a clown like Tony OBrian making stupid statements and excuses for the wrongs he did you stepped down now go find a better hiding place shame on you
@IrishTimes Ex HSE boss and not fit for purpose that is why he resigned, Simon has the most difficult job in Government OBrian is the one responsible fort he cervical check fiasco shamton you
@NewstalkFM It’s sad to see Tony OBrian casting aspersions on. others when he was the one the minister should have to rely on browsed ego
@timmydooley Anything Peter Casey says can only be put down to the ramblings of an escaped mental hospital inmate he was totally lost on the late late show and it was cruelty for Ryan T to expose the poor thing to big questions which he did not understand or answer
@Martin44152 @BigDunc123 They are just ordinary phones if they need security they use incepted phones it’s not a Masonic Lodge or a secret society it’s a police force
@anonjohn3 @BigDunc123 Yes they do
@NewstalkFM If it were your family who was eatin alive how would you feel once a tiger gets a taste for human flesh they will hunt humans
@cooper_m The no. 10 did well the big no 20 got a shock
@Independent_ie Dirty old Bastard when one thinks of those unfortunate girls and then look at brood of viper it’s hard not to loose it, what ever jail time he got I hope it’s hard
@IrishTimesOpEd I wonder how Peter Casey feel if the travelers targeted Him and his Buisness
@rtenews What a clown 🤡 this man Peter Casey suffers from the worst case of megalomania I have ever seen the expression on his face tells all his poor wife must be mortified
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes @fotoole Fintan the people of Gibraltar want to stay as they are

@SimonHarrisTD Simon it’s very easy to listen to someone who makes sense of the world at large Mary R was the first of a bunch of very strong women who shaped and molded our society as said if one keeps talking your repeating what you already know if you listen you may learn something good luck
@anonjohn3 @BigDunc123 It happens all the time there banks of phones a member will take a phone and sign it out and by the way do you think the Garda commissioner six phones ? Because there are six phones misplaced cop on
@IrishTimes It’s not long enough
@Philip_Ryan @CormacMcQuinn No they would not the Catholic Church in Ireland is in the final stages of meltdown or are you looking at the history channel the Church in Finglas that accommodated 3000 is been demolished and replaced with one to accommodate 359 and population on the area has doubled??
@kenfoxe Stop looking for soft targets it’s a form of bullying and no one cares
@IrishTimes Thank you Richard
@skydavidblevins Mary to me your likened to an icebreaker in the frozen north you opened so many pathways  for so many people in so many ways under difficult conditions with Church and state locked in bygone ways and ideology you are a hero and we are very proud of you bless you
@donlav Well done 👍
@niallemcmahon @BigDunc123 That was my point, so when some miss informed space cadet spreads misinformation on social media it has to be addressed otherwise people will start believing it, but then you do have to be equipped with the brains to logically annualize it, unfortunately not all had that gift
@donlav I agree I also believe there should be a mandatory psychiatric test for people like those to see if they are fit to serve as a TD democracy has spoken stop trying to get cheap publicity typical of a small town political figure get on and do your job if you are able ??
@BigDunc123 Noirin O’Sullivan did not misplace the phones they got lost in the organization as lots of people use those phones and the information that was and is on those phones is available laptops are also used by lots it different members that information is also available so cop on
@Independent_ie What a laugh
@TimesofIsrael @donlav Anti inoculation protesters take note
@thejournal_ie Mary you changed the President of  Ireland’s image for ever for the good many thanks
@Independent_ie Thank god Fool
@Colmogorman @donlav Will someone get real the reason for the low turnout was majellen laundry, mother &amp;baby homes, child sex abuse by priests, exploitation of unmarried mothers, the Catholic Church was responsible for the low turnout rate should be complemented for highlighting the scandals - shame
@IvanYatesNT Ivan you are howell still a teenager at heart long may Last cheers
@IrishTimesOpEd I agree with Stephen Collins the media have a huge responsibility when I comes to what they publish Peter Casey in particular used the media to publish and embellish untruthful comments in it’s raw state which became almost real that’s the responsibility of the media researchers
@thejournal_ie Yes for two reasons one they would be on hand with no other distractions two they would free up the already over stretched Garda however they would have to be under the control of and answerable to Gardaí
@AFSpecOpsCmd Was it fat Albert?
@HangBlaa John, Tommy Cooper is not dead just like that we laughed at him as well and he hadn’t even started
@DesmondNora @Independent_ie I always when you don’t agree with facts you will say the author is been ridiculous or some such words, I did not say anything about Catholic mass goers, I said people who are indoctrinated with non factual religious beliefs they create fear in people,they are vulnerable fact
@IrishTimesWorld Well done President Donald Trump you’re hitting the right notes

@DesmondNora @Independent_ie Anywhere that vulnerable people are exploited because of their beliefs and faith is of concern to all humanity and fair minded people it is a form of bullying no more hiding for the Catholic Church why should non catholic taxpayers have to pay for the Pope visiting Ireland? ??
@thejournal_ie He is absolutely correct
@campaignforleo @RTENewsNow Badly needed good stuff one for landings one for takeoff makes things safer and quicker cheers 🥂

@historylvrsclub Is that the reason Teddy’s first political party was known as the Bull Moose party seeing he’s on a Moose crossing the river
@kierancuddihy Your absolutely correct if you call that fame ?
@DubFireBrigade Will done girls and guys thanks 🙏
@No41Association @41RTES Remembering my fallen family heroes to young to die RIP
@JOEdotie He jumped the Stardust gun as they have asked him to stay away from their march and they did not ask him represent them, dishonest, stupidity, imaginations, megalomania can he not find a hiding place
@HangBlaa You are probably correct what the ordinary people in UK don’t realize how educated we are in Ireland our parents worked hard to educate us comparing to the UK we have over ten times their rate of third level educated people and as you know knowledge is power, the brain drain
@HangBlaa John they do a conservative MP spoke out a couple of weeks ago about the vacuum in politics in UK stated that they should look at Ireland’s government and how the parties are working together achieving almost full employment and the best growth in Europe paid the banks debt 👍
@radiokerrynews @MOReganIT Shame on you most other co co,s are trying to distance themselves from the nomination did you not read the news he is the most dishonest person in the race
@HangBlaa And they seem to think we are doing better than they are and we had to start from scratch when the British left Ireland they took all the money the government or the day had to send messengers to all the county councils to collect money to pay government expenses
@IrishTimesSport Yes Micheal I new a man who retired on Friday and turned up for work on Monday as usual the boss let him do little bits to keep him happy he sounds like he is still canvassing and no one is listening Not FG Not FF Not LAB O where O where is my Mona O where O where can she be ?
@SiCarswell That’s it he is a well educated man who cares for people he knows how to conduct himself he loves this country and it’s people unlike the thugs who were running against him l think they are all sharing the same brain except when Casey has it, it seems to malfunction poor things
@IrishTimesPol When is Sean Gallagher going to realize he is not wanted people are asking who is he what does he do another answered that’s the lad who sued rte and cost the Irish tax payer over €400k between compensation and costs and then he has the Gaul to ask about expenses of President ?
@IrishTimes Sounds about right the last refuge of a scoundrel
@Independent_ie Miriam the race would have been a lot different had you been in it you know what your talking about you’re well versed and knowledgeable on all aspects of life and your psychology and philosophy you would win your also a very beautiful lady that would also bring glamour as well
@MiriamOCal Miriam Micheal is a nice guy but after the program interview you may need a brain scan
@thejournal_ie Absolutely not it’s a cost we do not need Seven years just fine
@oconnellhugh @ger_oconnor Do not mind what Peter Casey says he keeps throwing out wild statements with no substance or accuracy in the hope that some less intelligent people may believe what like the plutocrats of old the plebes believed, the dinosaurs are gone, so is Casey type politics, no plebes here
@rtenews You are not wanted don’t you understand?
@colettebrowne @rtenews Well said it shows the foolish nature of the man I described him as a member of the self admiration society and he proves it every time he opens his mouth
@IrishTimes Peter Casey doesn’t realize we got rid of his type of corrupt politics together with corruption in the Catholic Church we are not going to lapse back there we worked to hard to get where we are to let a foolish person like him ruin it he thinks this is some type of game show
@MRSC16 Rory you will not sleep tonight what a kick people lost their voices at the moment that ball 🏈 went between the post you are a cracker the pressure must have been massive cheers 🍻
@SeanDefoe @NewstalkFM Why would he did Casey apologies to Leo our Taoiseach show a bit of respect
@CillianHennessy @rtenews I agree some things the travelers do are inexcusable let society try and change that
@rtenews It was all about the travelers as it was the only thing he talked about
@IrishTimes This is an even bigger clown than I thought
@IrishTimes It was you and if you keep on lying to your self you need help
@colettebrowne I don’t understand why you are surprised FG voters supported Micheal D I am FG supporter I am a conservative right wing Protestant who believes in fairness good manners and humanity for all, he got the others because there was no one else to vote for
@caelivd @RossOCK @AkaPaulHoward You will be eight by then and no party would take u on you are u unelectable I have two friends who voted for you and they stated we didn’t want him to win and they new you wouldn’t that is why they did it we had people like you in politics in this country for years no more bye
@Independent_ie Still a donkeys as a neighbor remarked ,  who are you talking about said another Casey he answered what Casey he asked, the lad running for President, o that asshole he replied, to which another replied and what ass would want that for a hole , a round of laughter not nice lads
@thejournal_ie That’s a poll I like, Leo and company are in touch with the people they’re open and listening to all when it came to scolding the Pope about abuse of unmarried mothers and their babies 👶 something that would never happen in the past, abortion, weeding out corruption  Fine Gael
@NewstalkFM Micheal D has devoted his life to the people of Ireland as a learn-it professor in Galway university where the he students speak highly and fondly of him, the likes Gallagher,Casey’ and others had no chance it is a failure on their part to think they could unseat him with zero
@fotoole Yes Fintan I agree and it will add to their credit Casey’s on the other hand got none, had the others contracted on issues other than attending to undermine the office of the President and the president himself they would have done better they may have learned a lesson maybe?
@thejournal_ie Micheal D hasn’t left it’s his home for the next seven years 👍🍾 by that time Casey will be 80 he said he would only be able to do five years not much energy in him
@GardaTraffic Well done Garda that’s the way do it keep up the good work be polite do your job Drew Harris will back you
@CillianHennessy @rtenews You misinterpret my idea of thugs he made controversial comments about travelers and people receiving welfare your interpretation is they are  thugs, Issac Newton’s third law of relativity is Karma if you are we’ll of you don’t use it to attack the less well of, that’s a thug
@UlsterRugby Yes yes guys well done on form great staff fantastic results 👍
@Independent_ie It doesn’t say much for us to give that clown 🤡 a vote when he preying in vulnerable peoples lives leaving the travelers out of it and attacking the only decent man in the race shame on him as he is over seventy he won’t be around for the next time in seven years thank god
@UlsterRugby Good stuff guys
@Jim_Sheridan @donlav I agree when you reign or try to reign with out humanity and care and prey on vulnerable people Karma will catch you it may take a while but it will come like a thief in the night and then they lose all, you cannot rule by fear or being a bully someone will be waiting to get you
@HangBlaa @donlav John it would be fantastic if we could however the state itself participated in this awful tragedy with the Catholic Church and unfortunately it is all statute barred now and most of the culprits are dead but their wares are still there let’s convert them to housing ect.
@FlightIrish @donlav Nice to see the chippies  In the air the old gypsies purring well Pierce Cahall and CPT Darby Kennedy would love to see them flying it would be nice to rewind a little and press pause just for a little bit fare well old friends
@rtenews Casey probably had the Tugs voting for him I hope we have learned our lesson find another way to pick the President and keep foolish candidates of the ballots paper we don’t need stupidity and self admiration people bringing the shame on the presidents office Gallagher and Casey
@IrishTimes Congrats Mr President that exist poll gives me a good feeling I hope it does the same for you praise the lord for Professor Michael D Higgins President of Ireland 🇮🇪 we are proud of you for your creditable good mannered approach and dignity you bring to your office thank you 🙏
@campaignforleo @FineGael @CharlieFlanagan @josephamadigan @ReginaDo @SimonHarrisTD @simoncoveney @HHumphreysFG @MichaelDHiggins @HMcEntee @MurphyEoghan Yes we will vote for Micheal D the only decent person in the race Casey and Gallagher would love to be Micheal D poor things, I heard they sit in the darkness repeating I want to be President please god let me President I will not put any more plastic in the lake I will be good
@kwilli1046 @JJRyan64 Good man we need more like you well done
@grahamjsimmons @jamieheaslip Well said do not mess with the Lions it has lasted longer and gave more than most keep the red caps coming
@rtenews Good on you Leo, just like Brian O’Driscoll’s Shoulder to Shoulder documentary it is good to see the other side how else can one arrive at a conclusion, you always have in every equation three sides your side their side and harmony is somewhere in the middle, respect is the key
@IrishRugby @KEITHEARLS87 @Munsterrugby We proud of you man well done Keith your the man
@Colmogorman Pater Casey thinks Donegal is part of Northern Ireland he drives plastic balls into lakes, he thinks the people of Ireland are sponges, he doesn’t believe in the welfare state, I do not believe we have ever had as ugly a person as him in a Presidential race what a creepy guy
@JamesMelville @donlav Well said Lord Allen Sugar any chance of getting you as prim minster now we’re talking?
@IrishTimes Good six years is not enough it should be life sicko bastard
@IrishTimes Sean Gallagher is the laughingstock of the country’s normal people the only thing people seem to know about him is he sued Rte what he does or did in public life no one I ask seems to know as I said a member of the self admiration society and mentality impaired guild of same
@Independent_ie It makes a joke of the Presidential candidates talking about Michael Ds supposed to be expensive life style against the Pope 20 million cost to the taxpayers how many houses would we build with 20mil ? =800 where is Dumb and Dumber Gallagher &amp; Casey now Catholic Church it time ??
@thejournal_ie And rightly so nothing short of blatant fraud get the contact, cut corners,take the money, get out of town joe public will as usual carry the burden , people in charge of awarding contacts to contractors have a responsibility to insure the rules of procurement followed
@re_keogh @thejournal_ie Definitely Ivan won they looked and sounded lost when questioned by Ivan especially Casey and Gallagher could you imagine two people of their low intelligence representing our country if elected god forbid, would need full time care from the diplomatic staff what a nightmare
@MiriamOCal @TomClonan @Downsyndromecen @Therese Good stuff Miriam you should have been a Presidential candidate you could have given those Dragons a thing or two they would have been running for cover
@irishkeith09 @donlav @MetAlertIreland @IrelandAMVMT @PictureIreland @ancienteastIRL @TourismIreland @StormHour @barrabest @DiscoverIreland We are old
@Independent_ie Where was Gallagher for the last 7 years was he unemployed dose he need a job what dose he do he looks at you with that asinine grin on his face and trying to string a few words together that makes no sense he does better suing Rte maybe that’s he’s been living on for 7 years ?
@rtenews Good stuff and good luck to you and your wife and family thank you 🙏
@JOEdotie You need not worry you are unelectable so you can go back to whatever country you come from you are not an Irish man
@donlav @MichaelDHiggins Don it’s a breath of fresh with a man of your knowledge spells it out in that way Micheal D has spent his life serving the community and fighting for justice and equality and when you get a bunch of rascals like Gallagher and Casey attacking him when they have no credibility
@IrishTimes @harrymcgee Peter Casey has destroyed the Presidential campaign for all the others with his outrageous ugly and bad mannered rants I don’t even believe he is an Irish man who wants ugly peoples these days he has the face of a lunatic with no idea what he is talking about god help us co co ?
@Independent_ie This long over due the State and the inhumanity of the Catholic Church knows no bounds all babies want is to be loved and cared for it is the basic rules of humanity and with that care and love we create people who grow up as decent loving people karma will catch with you see ?
@IrishTimes This should be a garden of remembrance to those babies and to bring it home to all of us the wrongs of the state and Catholic Church who made a living out of this if you have a heart looking at your babies and then think you would feel if someone did this to your baby shame on U
@rtenews Does Sean Gallagher not realize how disliked he is or how on earth he could ever be president of this country he is a nothing why would he even run I have asked people what they thought of the candidates they describe Casey and Gallagher as sleazy hate figures?
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes Let us keep it that way with Michael D
@thejournal_ie What I cannot understand is have these fools running for the Presidency not come up with any ideas other than attacking the President doesn’t he realize that he is spoiling the election for his running mates he doesn’t care da da
@LovinDublin I believe Peter Casey should be prosecuted for his insulting and defamation of character statements, ugly should be his middle name what a creepy guy, I’d say he goes home at night and crying 😭 himself to sleep he keeps whispering Micheal D Micheal D please help me it’s not me
@thejournal_ie Sean Gallagher you are a lost cause you would make a good protester like my dog chases cars when he catches the car he can’t even drive i am afraid you will have to wait for lesser opposition to make any headway you’re doing your self no good just like Casey
@rtenews You are not doing your self any good with that line of questions you are only opening yourself to more damaging questions I asked you to think positive, been positive doesn’t mean things will turn out the way you want it means you will be ok no matter what way goes
@Independent_ie It’s hard to believe that there are clowns like Peter Casey in our country their mindset is from a bygone age how could anyone take advice on any aspect of life from him unless you want to create unrest and ill feelings it is people like him who start wars and civil unrest
@senatornoone Marc McSherry should loose his seat over his stance on abortion what a clown FF I ask you
@Independent_ie There’s something very cynical that we  have started to ask questions about the Presidents expense we are a very well to do country The least we can do is show off a little it is also cynical that comes from a bunch of pretentious clowns ie the self admiration society
@maryroche That’s nice to think about your dad in that way Mary they could be strolling on a strand in a faraway land the beautiful home of the sole , cheers
@MarieTBrady @TheRadioOfficer @thejournal_ie If Miriam  O,Callaghan had gone forward as a candidate she would not have been tethered at the starting gate it’s all about creditably good manners and decency with a fairness attitude and how to present oneself
@TheRadioOfficer @MarieTBrady @thejournal_ie I agree however when one is 3/4 way down the track even a poor old donkey would win, not that I am referring to anyone in the race is a donkey, however feel free yourself I prefer to think kindly
@MarieTBrady @TheRadioOfficer @thejournal_ie The latest opinion polls revile 7 out of 10 will vote for Micheal D that makes me happy mostly because the other candidates ie Casey, Gallagher, Duffey are so inept and so out of touch with the people’s views on them or the idea that anybody would vote them, so disillusioned
@UlsterRugby @KingspanStadium Never mind guys
@LiadhNiRiadaMEP @donlav For gods sake think of something positive to say to advance your position forget about protest politics it  never works take a leaf out of your late Dads book a very nice gentleman with only good things to say about people who was loved by all who new him good luck 🍀
@thejournal_ie Micheal D or any President does not arrange his or her travel or plans he is told what they have arranged he simply goes along with the arrangements as others look after security extremely important
@Independent_ie Thank you for that insight into the complexities of the traveler v the settled community The likes of Peter Casey doesn’t have the brain power or training to deal with political issues he comes over as a man making things up as he goes along does he not realize it won’t work
@IrishTimesCultr @IrishTimes Well one lunatic to another at least Trump has turned the USA economy around best growth in 12 years maybe Peter Casey was in hope if he won the Presidency he might meet Trump and hope to exchange stories
@donlav Sitting on the fence as usual as he was when the referendum campaign was held it seems he cannot lead he is more of a protester than leader
@Csorensenbp @BrianODriscoll Brian we wouldn’t have expected anything less from you it’s a great documentary and very wide in appeal and attributes of our sport Rugby and its unifying achievement over the years it did not matter where we played the clubs in the north or south we were Rugby players IRFU 👍
@thejournal_ie Sean Gallagher running for President of Ireland is bizarre seems you have nothing to offer of your own except find fault with Michael D negative words are all you know
@lionsofficial Happy birthday Paul you are one great guy Gentleman legend in your lifetime 👍🏉
@IrishTimes Yes Mary you’re correct as things are at the moment the peace in NI is on a knife edge there are people on both sides with a vested interest in causing trouble, and all the hard work done by you and others will be lost, stay well Mary you were a great President thank you 🙏
@Independent_ie George there are people jumping our border everyday this is a special case I know it’s the law and if we break our own law it could set a precedent in law if we are not careful how about giving him a 90 year visa to visit
@JOEdotie You see no respect for authority at any level as I said a tug in a suit this is the way the travelers would act I rest my case
@Independent_ie You have to be one of the stupidest people on the planet to make a statement like that but then you a Fianna Fáil TD no wonder you are where you are in the pols, with people like you and your mindset no wonder you the FF set got us in the mess we were in Bankruptcy Ireland?
@coleman_padraic @Independent_ie Yes he did and even he knows he did it is not whether the travelers are right or wrong and I agree he is right about travelers causing trouble as the President he can not hold these reduces he is supposed to be a President for all the people without race color or creed
@RareIrishStuff @donlav Dev. you Shit, what a contribution Micheal Collins world have made
@BigDunc123 George Simon worries about everyone’s well being, you used to be a good blue shirt 👕 what’s gone wrong
@IrishTimesLife @IrishTimes The dragons have no creditably or moral compasses and are wrapped up in their own  self importance god help Ireland, O my Dark Rosaleen  Do Not Sigh Do Not Weep  The Dragons are on the Ocean Green they March beneath the Deep
@IrishTimes I agree with Eddie Moran’s comments re property, Garda, and respect
@gardarep @TomClonan Well done guys 👍thank you
@IrishTimes She was at fault as she’s admitted why the compensation?
@Independent_ie If you make a mistake you could say sorry and continue that would be the manly thing to do
@TheRadioOfficer @thejournal_ie Anyone who uses insults and bad manners towards others can never be ok,Casey and others has to realize he is not running as a politician to form part of the government where he can vote on legislation he is running for the Presidency who has to be impartial in all matters
@LovinDublin That’s a nice story you are famous as well for assaulting Michea D you will have to vote for him now to repay him for the assault
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Don’t mind that FF Td all he wants is a bit of publicity on the cheap or maybe he is trying to impress someone if he had anything to say he should have said it before the vote doesn’t say much for his ability to make a decision
@thejournal_ie Sean Gallagher is a dopey think of something new to talk about or is that all there is to you
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes T know where his Blue heart 💜 is lake my own cheers 🍻 Michael well done
@Independent_ie Fool
@Independent_ie People with his attitude has no place in our country particularly in public life
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Fintan you got it in one,  however voters we’re misled at election time I have a vote in UK as well as Ireland I am happy to say I vote conservative and my MP asked me to vote to leave I did had I known what I know now I would not have
@JOEdotie Simon is very able politically and otherwise to do battle with the best he is well versed and knowledgeable on all aspects of of his role we are lucky to have him, he  didn’t lick of the ground either good luck Simon you have a tough job many thanks
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes I am delighted for you you are decent man and no family let alone you should have to endure such wrongs shame on those who perpetrated these wrongs against you and when one sees the collateral damage caused to others commissioner, minister double shame bless you and good luck
@MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes I am not criticizing Micheal D I am praising him and my family’ are voting for him the other was chit chat with you, thank you for the info
@MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes So why did Presidents in the past say they want the attorney Generals opinion ? Does the President send it back to the government to get the advice of the Attorney?
@Independent_ie Doesn’t matter where he goes he is a nobody
@NewstalkFM Thank you Charlie that’s the decent thing to do but you are a member of F.G. who will always do decent thing
@MaryOGrady8 @IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes What I answered was the suggestion that the President resign to campaign if he did that he could not sign as President and the President has plenty of time to sign and if has doubts about legislation he can forward it to the Attorney General for his opinion that could take time
@Ke_Molloy @donlav @CaseyPeterJ What an clown the President has no power whatsoever others than signing the documents on decisions made by the government the seat of power is with the government does Casey know nothing about the dynamics’s of the state and its rules there are plenty of schools for adults try it
@IrishTimes Peter Casey should pray to saint Loman or if he choose Saint Dymphna who are patron saints of the mentally disturbed all he can do is pick on people and find faults in their lives and then he has the nerve to think people would vote for him the others are distancing themselves
@IrishTimes Peter Casey should pray to Saint Loman
@thejournal_ie Peter Casey should pull out of the Presidential election he is without doubt one of the ugliest people I ever heard it is an insult to the Irish people for a country council to nominate him there is no doubt there is a village missing an idiot god protect Ireland 🇮🇪 from that
@IrishTimes Thank is what you get when one runs a decent statesman’s like good mannered campaign the others have no decorum, no manners, not educated and with no ability how to conduct themselves with the public they atacting like Tugs
@thejournal_ie The reason Casey is so insignificant mr 2% in the polls is his negative campaign attitude to the Presidents office his bad manners and his inability to realize that Ireland is a very different place now, as the referendum has proved the Catholic Church and others are gone
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes He couldn’t as if there was something to be signed into law there would be no one there to do so
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes I agree the Esb are the best people to do that job now you’re making sense
@donlav @Andrew_Adonis Yes mostly by the British
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes And why wouldn’t he , he is a very decent man
@neil_skippy @rtenews Don’t be reduced to that way of thinking he is not a showman like the others who are full of their own self importance to have the presidents job on their CV ,like the old proverb says some of the people can wrong sometimes all of the people can’t be wrong all of the time
@SkySportsRugby @Munsterrugby What a fantastic man rugby 🏉 player and all round nice guy you left your mark on Irish ☘️ Rugby you will be remembered fondly praise the lord for your with us Rest In Peace
@HangBlaa Yes it is
@thejournal_ie Yes Leo lets go
@HangBlaa John I think you’re taking a different interpretation of the meaning nation to Arlene’s meaning but one would never know
@alisonoconn Why would Micheal D lower the standards of the Presidents office by attending or getting involved in a debate with a bunch of misfits who don’t know their ass from their elbow it is without doubt the worst lineup that has ever ran in the election for President Casey I ask you
@rtenews You sound so stupid me me me do you not realize the revulsion the people have towards you, you are bad mannered, your insulting, what kind of image would we have in the world if you were president we would be the laughingstock of the world
@rtenews @ClaireByrneLive What a clown 🤡
@HangBlaa @donlav I agree
@rtenews Sean Gallagher couldn’t debate with a class of school kids clown
@IrishTimes What a clown doesn’t know where to post his letters Gallagher seems to have joined Casey in stupidity ranks god help Ireland with a misfit like him surely he must have a doctor to help him with his problems, compared to that lot Micheal D looks like God
@IrishTimes Because to much of its budget goes on management who do nothing for the salary they receive and are surplus to requirement doctors, nurses, and medical stuff is where the money should go as well as beds
@Murray_Kinsella Great staff Rory 👍
@UlsterRugby Absolutely and why not cheers lads
@thejournal_ie Well done lads you are to be commended for doing the right thing you have a big responsibility and you did what was needed thank you
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes And so he should good luck Denis
@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes Not a chance nothing you have to say will pay the bills that is all the voters are interested in and Trump is doing that
@IrishTimes Just goes to show the type they are utterly stupid and useless unable to say we were wrong sorry they would have done a lot of good for themselves by doing so
@MichaelDHiggins I agree President Michael D in mixed schools where the girls and boys are together in class the boys do better than they do in all boys classes the Girls do make the boys do better all through their lives, yes Micheals D feminism is Ok
@NiamhoNiamh @BrianODriscoll Fantastic from the great man
@retrochbabe @donlav Martin Luther saw that ugliness centuries ago hence the berth of the Protestant Church praise the lord it would be worth ones time to read up on it,the Catholic Church is about collecting money and wealth the Protestant Church is about the congregation and their spiritual state
@UlsterRugby @Dicksondigital @KingspanStadium @michaellowry15 @JacobStockdale @Jordimurphy @ALOConnor4 Your welcome thank you 🙏
@sinead_ryan You got it in one Sinead deeply dislikable with no manners or anything resembles a statesman more like a Tug in a suit the what is he doing in the race ? Does he not realize this is a President of Ireland 🇮🇪 election , I do believe some villagers are missing an idiot
@UlsterRugby @JCooney09 Yes John congratulations 🍾 on man of the match you deserve it well done fantastic performance good luck
@BrianODriscoll @MiriamOCal Yes Miriam I agree and it was Brian’s personality that helped make it so interesting and balanced great man cheers Brian 👍
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes When we listen to the appalling way that circus clown Peter Casey spoke in that debate you wouldn’t give him a job as a car park attendant Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffey didn’t do any better listening to them and what they had to say was thy best reason to vote for Micheal D
@seangallagher1 God help us if he got elected
@Independent_ie Well done girl good luck 👍
@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes Not enough it’s only token gestures
@MichaelDHiggins I agree the only statesman in the race Micheal D👍
@IrishTimes Good luck and best wishes to Richard and the other appointments in your new office I wish you well
@JOEdotie Apart From Michael D I find it hard to believe we have the cost of a presidential election brought about by the worst bunch of misfits the nation could muster up all of them fully paid up members of the self administration society, they should stop looking in the mirror
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes Commissioner Drew Harris will clean that mess up and whip the force into shape 👍
@IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes The Pope reluctantly accepted the resignation of Cardinal Wurel for sexual abuse on children what kind of monster is he, he should have been booted out or sent to prison
@thejournal_ie After reading Judge Carlton’s report I hope the public has noticed Noirin Sullivan, Frances Fitzgerald, Allen Shatter one Maurice McCabe  were all showing to be honorable and decent people shame on those who messed up their lives, and remember KARMA ???
@MichaelDHiggins @donlav @PatKennyNT Yes Micheal D is dealing with issues like a president the real reason he will win
@irishtimesvideo @IrishTimes You don’t have to be elected president to promote the role of women in politics just do it those angles are cheap and and will get you nowhere
@IrishTimes Who needs a hit man when they have your lot and the slurry pits in Galway
@Independent_ie Bastard
@rtenews @wallacemick It is the craziest building on the planet when they allow a crazy person like you inside you seem to be talking rubbish non stop
@IrishTimes Thank the lord Ireland is no longer defined a Catholic country or where have you been in the last ten years what a persons sexual orientation is is nothing to do with ability to do a good job as Leo has proven the most popular prime minister we ever had
@thejournal_ie Don’t stop doing what you do right will never be wrong as Karma will prove
@IT_HealthPlus @IrishTimes Very sad day for all praise the lord for Emma’s time on earth and I hope she has awakened all who are in a position to give the best advice and medical treatment to prevent what happened Emma in the future god bless you RIP Emma
@JOEdotie Dopey
@IrishTimes I agree
@Independent_ie What a stupid man doesn’t he realize the the damage he is doing to  his Church or is he the same as the abuser priest he has vowed to stamp out ??
@marybuckley549 @donlav @IrishTimes I agree he has lost all moral respect and he would be better keeping his mouth shut the Catholic Church has abused women and children and they are still doing it shame on you
@ghook George I am surprised at you a good old blue shirt like your self picking on your own
@DublinAirport @donlav @aeroflot Now you’re talking there’s a trade counter cheers 🍻
@OxfordDiplomat @donlav @BorderIrish @Scientists4EU @DavidLammy @campbellclaret @carolecadwalla @MaryLouMcDonald @RemainiacsCast @Andrew_Adonis @Anna_Soubry Well said 👍
@IrishTimes Well done co co about time someone stood up
@Independent_ie Maybe we should make him King 👑
@JOEdotie David you have given us a lifetime of the best natural life documentary films you have done more in your world wide travels to help endangered species and made people aware of our planet than any one else you have a very calming affect on your viewership bless you and thank you
@Independent_ie I predict Micheal by a landslide because the others are so bad and the President so good 😊 praise the lord for Michael D he will get my vote and that’s  saying a lot from a right wing conservative Protestant to a left wing socialist like Ml D 👍
@donlav @mupper2 I agree the Navy needs beefing up as well as the Garda to combat drugs,trafficking of all illegal items thankfully they don’t have the same freedom in the skies and  Pilots are lookouts we have the drug hotline in our bag it’s the same all over
@donlav @mupper2 We do monitor our airspace and the IAA collect millions of euro from other countries for doing as a pilot I know how regulated the airspace is in every country including Ireland, we are not in the Middle East or close to conflict zones we have other priorities  at the moment
@mupper2 @donlav Don the Britain will always protect us brexit or not as David Cameron stated when they wrote the cheque for Billions to bail us out when asked would he be doing the same Greece, etc. he stated no Ireland is the only country in Europe we have anything in common with, they love us
@Independent_ie You’re wife should look at facts he put plastic in a lake he thinks Donegal is in UK and he hasn’t a clue about protocol and the Presidents job and when he was caught driving golf balls into the lake polluting when  he realized the public outcry like a child i dived in and got it
@thejournal_ie That Animal should never be allowed out prison life with hard time in a Russia
@NewstalkFM Good luck man
@donlav Don who would to attack friendly old Ireland 🇮🇪 and by the way we would build a lot of houses with price of a Gripen
@TommyBowe14 @eirSport Don’t rub it in  Tommy I know you’re quite a comedian in your own right and a very nice guy  but that’s cruelty mate
@RichardbrutonTD @donlav Thank you Richard Bruton It takes 	F.G. To do the right thing that’s the reason I vote FG and always will many thanks 🙏
@HangBlaa If Micheal Collins had been the head of state this would have been a better country Emon Dev. and Catholic Church would not have got away with the atrocities unmarried mothers had to put up with, perhaps Mick. was a relation of yours he was a great man
@HangBlaa Like it
@leinsterrugby @joshvdf What a man cheers mate
@Independent_ie Yes Brendan I agree with most of your article, when you say we respond to items and statements made by others in a reactive way that’s when we become aware of the mindset of the author like Isaac Newton’s 3rd law of relativity we react to this that is how we learn and do better
@simongerman600 @davidmcw Especially when they did not have phones,planes,internet, just carrier pigeons, smoke signals, and slow boats as Bruce Forsyth said didn’t they do well
@KenBrownGolf @SkySportsGolf Here here
@rtenews This problem would not have come to the attention Richard Bruton if it were not highlighted by the court case Mr Briton a very decent man will fix the problem now that he knows about it of that you can be assured
@thejournal_ie Mainly because Micheal D has been a champion for the less well off and oppressed for years he has been campaigning as a politically elected member of the house he is a professor with a great knowledge of life not like the clowns who are running against him the self admired
@IrishTimes What a clown should have kept his mouth shut it gets worse for him if he searched for a week he would not find a golf ball in the Lough is that the moment he realized what he did was wrong you are supposed to make these decisions like a grownup god help us if he ever got elected
@JOEdotie Maybe it’s the Americans attitude that’s affected him
@IrishTimes It’s scandalous that a student works hard and stressful time coming to exams then some dimwit marks the paper wrongly it is not good enough to say sorry and remark a year later without any regard for the students losses the person who marks the paper should be fined in some way
@IrishTimesOpEd @IrishTimes @fotoole Fintan the people of Gibraltar want to stay as they are
@IrishTimes Careful what you wish for Micheal that FF tiger is dead , and he didn’t father any cubs we had to create a new mold for Ireland 🇮🇪 Leo Varadkar, as Taoiseach,Abortion,the wish of the people ,Catholic Church, put in their place Drew Harris as Garda commissioner all good stuff
@Independent_ie Peter Casey knows nothing about pollution or geography or what the presidents job is , as he is a member of the self admiration society he has no chance
@OldCrescentRFC1 @qubrfc @IrishRugby They won’t be that bad will they ??
@donlav @PeterMurtagh What a stupid man how could you take someone like him seriously he thinks the water is the fairway, he cannot see Donegal and his geography may not be good but he can see the water
@GardaTraffic Nice one 👍
@Independent_ie It’s a start
@Independent_ie That’s not the way to go if he raped you he may have gone on and raped others as he got away with it sex abuse on children and women is the worst of all crimes you should report it even now
@SamuelLJackson That is a very stupid video to make about a very serious matter the problem with this video is there are so many uninformed people who will not know it is fiction not reality and that’s not good for people who are sexually abused funny no thanks
@RoryBest2 Doctor Rory Best you cannot beat the farmer when it comes to bringing one dawn to reality the Ryder Cup doesn’t have a look in when it comes to an Aberdeenangus

@BPOB @IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes With good reason freedom of expression is alive and well in Ireland hiding your identity unless you are a policeman is not
@Latinogar @IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes More stupidity we can see their faces to identify them
@PatriciaMAC10 @IrishTimesWorld @IrishTimes What a stupid statement you should be more careful embarrassing yourself and your family like that people will talk
@HangBlaa We need Britain, Britain need us there are more than three times as many Irish people living in Britain as  are in Ireland they need our brain power and our creative minds thats why we box well above our weight on the world stage Dev no Collins would would have made a difference
@rtenews Fantastic The big gentle giant I know him well he had only good things to say about people and life in general he told me one time ( I think I was ment to be an old farmer) well Big Man you made a lot of people very happy 😊 good to see him sitting there praise the lord RIP
@IrishTimesPol @IrishTimes Micheal if you took a leaf out of Leo’s book you might do better is your politics now that of protest rather then come up with something positive young people relate to Leo or haven’t you noticed it is the young people are who will decide the future of our country think positive
@IT_HealthPlus @IrishTimes Not good for his health mental or physical you need to teach him to be positive about everything which means in definition everything may not turn out the way he wants but being positive means he will be OK no matter what the outcome
@IrishTimesSport @IrishTimes This is the least talked about Ryder Cup in my lifetime is that because it’s in France ??

@HangBlaa Rubbish John the Garda should use whatever means at their disposal to stay safe and keep you safe and you may or may not know we are policed in a democracy by consent the Garda stand between us and anarchy you should be ashamed of your self if you have the ability?
@TJ_Politics @thejournal_ie Micheal have you the remotest idea what you are talking about regarding health and housing like the Catholic Church’s ramblings about their wrongs why don’t you man up and accept the mess you created and say sorry and get on with the job you were elected to do people are fed up
@NewstalkFM What a load crap the Irish people remember you broke the Banks you broke the construction industry you should bow your head in shame you all went into hiding and let others fix the mess you created now you are sneaking out hoping no one noticed we do,scoundrels have manners
