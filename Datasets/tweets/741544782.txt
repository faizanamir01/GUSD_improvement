How do you understand direct action?	Direct action by a group reveals an existing problem, highlights an alternative, or demonstrates a possible solution to a social issue. This can include nonviolent and violent activities which target what is offensive to the participants.
How would you describe civil disobedience?	Civil disobedience: Refusal to obey the demands of a government or occupying power without resorting to active measures of opposition; A major tactic of nationalist movements in India, the civil rights movement, and of labor, anti-war.
Can you find a better definition? 	Anarchy is society without law or supreme power; Lawlessness or political disorder; Destruction of government, confusion. 	A society relying on good manners rather than law, each producing according to his ability &amp; receiving according to need.
