@TomCokeIsABlunt @sofain @gol_mia I’m assuming Ellen’s bs interview with Kevin Hart, though it’s more like “people calling Ellen out” than “people offended“ https://t.co/1J3dyyzqjj
@amazingatheist You’re making things up.	People calling out Ellen for that Hart bs aren’t pulling offense out of nowhere.
@AMeisner32 @hwolfie @WilliamShatner I would love a link to that apology “a few years ago,” because what I’ve seen people call an apology from a few years ago wasn’t an apology
@toolan No, I can’t.		I believe you are being honest about how you... feel 😉		Let’s say someone punched you in the gut. You could suddenly *make yourself* feel elated?		Are you never scared? Never disappointed? Never angry? Because you can suddenly make yourself not feel that way?
@mistressmira402 @WilliamShatner @KevinHart4real @TheEllenShow I didn’t say otherwise.
@AlongsideWild Gastropod Lonesome George :(
@WilliamShatner Do you hold the same opinion regarding Louis C K’s “jokes” about school shootings?

@McLeanBen @WilliamShatner @KevinHart4real @TheEllenShow ?
@Stizzle7o9 @WilliamShatner @KevinHart4real @TheEllenShow 1. You can’t choose feelings	2. Nobody is “beating anyone with shame”
@mistressmira402 @WilliamShatner @KevinHart4real @TheEllenShow Use all the words you like, don’t expect people to not react.
@JayDavidMurphy @WilliamShatner Yup, I’m totally pwned. Except, he’s wrong. I’m open to forgiving people who actually apologize.
@kittie_kaye @WilliamShatner There is potential for forgiveness, so how about not saying such a thing?
@WilliamShatner Not really apologizing if someone acting apologetic dismisses people upset as “haters” and “trolls” and acts likes there’s a conspiracy against them		This article puts it better than I can in a tweet.		I’m open to forgiving, suggesting otherwise is wrong.		https://t.co/1J3dyyzqjj
@RobSchneider I’m not sure which is worse: this or your anti-vaxxer crap.
@RobSchneider @TheEllenShow @KevinHart4real You have thoughts about beating children for playing with dolls because such an act is “gay?”
@WilliamShatner @KevinHart4real @TheEllenShow Drawing attention to the stuff he has said wasn’t bullying. Dismissing people as “haters” is harmful.

@Global_Occupant Wow, was not expecting that. That’s messed up. Have fun with your bigotry (and yes, you’re no longer criticizing ideas when you say Muslims have no place in America. Wtf).
@Global_Occupant It really seems like you’re going after her simply for being a Muslim. There are so many Christian supremacists in Congress, it’s pretty weird for you to single out a Muslim who says she believes in secular government and question whether or not she’s secretly an Islamist.
@Global_Occupant Do you apply the same line of thinking to Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc? 🤔
@Global_Occupant “That” refers to your tweet

@CriticalRiposte Holy crap, you’re trying to compare slave/master to boss/employee.		I don’t even.
@CriticalRiposte He inherited her from his father-in-law. Do you not understand how slavery worked? He OWNED her. LITERALLY.
@CriticalRiposte I will try one last time.	Do you seriously not get that if she said no to him he could do those things to her? A slave is inherently threatened. A slave inherently CANNOT give consent to their master. EVER.		Saying “no” to someone who OWNS you is extremely dangerous 🙄
@CriticalRiposte You aren’t making sense because a slave was a slave. Anyone with “slave” status was... a slave.
@CriticalRiposte He OWNED her. As a slave. Same as any other slave. He could beat her, torture her, get away with murdering her if he wanted to. I don’t see what is difficult about this.
@CriticalRiposte There is no situation where a slave can give consent, wtf?
@CriticalRiposte Afaik he recognized slavery is evil but kept at it because he was a massive hypocrite who didn’t want to be economically ruined.
@CriticalRiposte @PapaBirdJake Sally Hemings.	I didn’t mean more than one (though that is very well possible), sorry if my phrasing was confusing.		(Keep in mind, a slave cannot give consent to a slave-owner)
@CriticalRiposte @PapaBirdJake While it has nothing to do with your point, I find it hilarious that a dude who owned and raped slaves would say such a thing. He was an authority not responsible “to the people” (his slaves).

@LaloDagach 3/3	When someone uses the same cultural/moral relativism bs to say we shouldn't judge people today for horrible things, do you agree w/ them?	Surely, u don't.		Absolute bollocks 2, say, not condemn honor killers b/c "its culture." They're horrible ppl whether or not they think so
@LaloDagach 2/3	Your relativistic statement fails firstly because you're talking about a man who was acknowledged to be a terrible person *in his own time,* secondly because no matter where/when you are, you should realize you're causing suffering when you do the horrible things C did.
@LaloDagach You are giving a poor argument against taking down a statue that *honors* a terrible person.	1st, it doesn't matter if none can meet "today's standards," that's irrelevant. Historical value of statues deserves consideration, sure. This statue was put in... 1973, to honor C. 1/2

@IsItTime2Eat @cslick803 @SachaBaronCohen “I was reading off a prompter” isn’t an excuse, but I wasn’t saying SBC “made him” say it in the first place so I’m not sure what you’re trying to say to me.
@cslick803 @SachaBaronCohen I’m talking to you because you said he was being respectful when he clearly wasn’t. If you don’t like receiving replies, don’t post publicly.
@cslick803 @SachaBaronCohen Respectful people don’t go around asking about genitalia like Pyne did. If you think otherwise, I would love to see some video of you going around asking people about the genitalia of their partners to show me up, that at least when you say it people don’t find it disrespectful.
@cslick803 @SachaBaronCohen Chris, do you have a partner? Describe their genitalia to me.		This? This is impolite lmfao
@bigratsgoboom The whole point of that is to be outrageous and cheese him off and get him to say silly things. Which he did.
@bigratsgoboom Not to mention prayer in schools/abstinence only sex-ed and saying SBC’s son shuddering at porn was a positive outcome.
@bigratsgoboom Fine? Not how I saw it. He talked about a creepy registry, banning porn, and asked SBC about their partner’s genitalia.

@PapaBirdJake I meant because there are so many things that could be factors helping to explain his behavior :P
@PapaBirdJake Weird to me to jump to asking if autistic, but fair enough
@Homodorkus @PapaBirdJake Imitations made things so much easier for me in cutting meat/dairy.		Also, I get a lot of protein from veggie burgers, Quorn “chicken,” “beefless ground,” etc.
@PapaBirdJake Can’t see the original tweet but I think I can understand what was said through context of other tweets enough to comment		My favorite vegan foods/dishes are imitations lol. My gf uses chemistry knowledge to make amazing mac and cheese, lasagna, normally non-vegan desserts, etc.

@LaloDagach NBA spots are limited, btw. Cycling in London can expand to the point that the infrastructure can handle it—and that infrastructure can be expanded.
@LaloDagach Did you read the article? There’s room to think infrastructure should be focused on over this, sure, but there’s nothing wrong with reducing barriers.		And you do realize this doesn’t involve sports, right? And that more people cycling is better for the city?
@kirkhope_edward @LaloDagach What’s ridiculous about reducing barriers like lack of cycling skills (as the article said would be targeted) or reducing barriers for older people with electric bicycles (as another article on this mentioned specifically?

@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist “Very similar”	Ok, please explain how it is very similar to Islam specifically (not just to other Abrahamic religions)
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist Not in substance, only in the circumstances of its origins.		The monotheistic core is just as much derived from Islam as it is derived from Judaism and is therefore not specifically derived from Islam.
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist Allah is the same as the Jewish god, silly goose.		And they believe in other people as prophets as well, are you simply being disingenuous?
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist “also Allah”	By that “logic”, Jews are basically Muslims.		The Baha’i Faith is totally different from Islam, ffs just look at the tenets.
@ParisaMichelle @Bl3nder_LDG @babylonscared @amazingatheist Surely not all monotheistic religions believe in the same god, but Judaism/Christianity/Islam/the Baha’i Faith do share one, yes.

The Baha’i F is very close to being 1
@cabbopearimo @Sam_Ehrenstein @amazingatheist It is except for some things (like being anti-gay, which can cause people harm and therefore isn’t exactly peaceful).	So, yeah, weird since she labeled herself a Baha’i activist at least at some point. I doubt religion played a role in this one.
@TheOratoracle @amazingatheist And while the god is the same as the god of Islam, the Baha’i Faith, while still nasty in many ways (like being anti-gay), promotes peace and unity and blah blah blah		I beg you to find Baha’i terrorists, lol, you’d be hard-pressed to find any.
@TheOratoracle @amazingatheist No, it’s more like saying “it wasn’t an Orthodox Jew, it was a Methodist Christian”
@NSakalidis @amazingatheist Depends on one’s use of the word “offshoot.” It essentially branched off from Islam and has the same monotheistic Abrahamic god but the beliefs developed in their own hippyish way to the point that it’s very, very different from Islam.
@amazingatheist And the Baha’i faith is far more pro-gender equality than Islam, so the instagram pics aren’t “hypocritical” or anything.	Not that it matters, it’ll be pretty strange if she turns out to not have done it primarily because she hates Youtube https://t.co/VljNdC0kTl

@SirCaspington @sapinker But you’re saying things that simply aren’t true. That’s not just “perspective.”
@SirCaspington @sapinker “They have no real knowledge”	What makes you say that? Have you listened to one word?
@SirCaspington @sapinker False. I support ppl in addressing school safety/gun violence in ways other than gun reform tho I’m focused on gun reform.

@SirCaspington @sapinker Well, on the “constructive and sensible” point, changes have already begun to occur and sensible policy points have been advocated for. Not agreeing with everything every one of them says doesn’t mean you should think they’re not sensible.

@reagancolbert97 (If you think eternal torture is moral, I hate to think what you would do if you thought your god told you to do it!)
@reagancolbert97 But, anyway, there’s no reaching you. You lack even a semblance of humanity. Just do me a favor, please: if you have/ever have kids and a voice in your head tells you to kill them, check into a hospital—the voice is not your god.
@reagancolbert97 Also, punishing someone for FOREVER is pretty fucking petty (in addition to being cruel beyond words).
@reagancolbert97 I dare you: choose to believe that 2 + 2 = 5. Try it. You can say 2 + 2 = 5 all you like but you can’t “choose” to believe it is true.
@reagancolbert97 You didn’t read what I said.	I don’t have any choice. I can’t “choose” to believe in something. Neither can you. You believe. You didn’t “choose” to believe.		You’re sick if you think torture is ok, let alone ETERNAL TORTURE
@reagancolbert97 Also, men can’t “come to repentance” in Hell, so I don’t see the point in sharing that verse.
@reagancolbert97 Also, you’re forgetting that I have no ability to choose to believe in and love your god, contradicting everything you say about choice.		I can’t choose to believe in him, just as I can’t choose to believe in Zeus.
@reagancolbert97 *for a few days
@reagancolbert97 Oy vey, he died on Earth for a few dies as a sacrifice to mitigate his own rules, what a mensch. /s		And doesn’t matter if he HAS the power to do it, I have spoken under the assumption that if your god were real then he would.		How he CHOOSES 2 use his power is the disgusting bit
@itatiVCS Congrats!
@reagancolbert97 The Bible does supply any reason from your god for for eternally torturing people.
@reagancolbert97 (Referring to it in another tweet that I thought this was a reply to)
@reagancolbert97 https://t.co/ea8JUegtcZ		I was referring to Luke 12:5
@reagancolbert97 But terrible people don’t matter, tbh. You sing praise of a being you think would TORTURE me FOREVER simply because I do not believe in him, if for no other reason.		If you don’t understand how effed up that would be, then you have no humanity and idk what else to say.
@reagancolbert97 Honestly, give me one good reason to torture someone infinitely. I disagree with all torture, but even if you think someone terrible should be, surely, eventually, they should be obliterated? Eternal punishment without the chance for redemption is disgusting beyond belief.
@reagancolbert97 And the Gospels don’t give reasoning for eternal punishment.		They say to fear your god, is that what you mean?		That’s a reason to follow his instructions, I guess, but doesn’t matter for me, as I said, as I’d hate him, and doesn’t give reasoning for eternal punishment.
@reagancolbert97 A) your god would not need to separate people from society. He could give everyone an individual afterlife or the shared one, couldn’t he?		B) your god could simply obliterate people instead of torturing them
@reagancolbert97 If you were in a relationship with a partner you hate and your partner said “LOVE ME OR I BURN YOU,” you would find yourself unable to do so. You could pretend, of course, but you couldn’t hide that from your god, could you? 🤔
@reagancolbert97 Lol I have no choice then, b/c if I believed in him then I’d hate him &amp; I couldn’t change that. I can’t choose to feel murder is ok, just as I can’t choose to feel eternal punishment is ok.		It’s the most f’ed up thing imaginable. Nobody deserves it, let alone for lack of belief.
@reagancolbert97 Maybe you’re some hippy dippy Christian who doesn’t believe in Hell, but I didn’t exactly get that vibe.
@reagancolbert97 What I said didn’t concern “making sense” except in why you would worship such a deity.		If I believed your god were real, I could not worship him. I can’t worship a monster, couldn’t even pretend—he’d know how I feel in my heart.		The basic concept of eternal punishment is evil.
@federalistmemes @KyleKashuv Hilarious.	You’re an ass.
@reagancolbert97 So you worship a deity you think would torture Hawking for not believing in him? Wtf is wrong with you? :O
@CarmineSabia Why are you being an arse? He needs no forgiving. If your deity existed, I'd say "fuck them" (the deity) if they thought that not believing in their sorry ass because no evidence of their existence was presented deserves punishment, let alone eternal torture.

HE PURCHASED THE AR-15 LEGALLY
@Adorable_Todd @BillOReilly @michael_fohey Fuck you. Religion drives people to tons of violence.
*shot
Why not after he had shoot near/at chickens of neighbors?		People like that need their guns taken away. Any guns he got legally he shouldn’t have been able to get in the first place.		Why are AR-15s available to the public?		If now is “not the time to bring this up,” then WHEN?
No, we can’t stop every shooting. But we sure as hell can make them more difficult and less common.		The shooter has a long history of red flags and owned a damn “arsenal” in his own words.		Why was he never investigated after making threats, as some reports say?
I had a terrifying moment where I thought I may have lost my brother.		While I of course feel relieved he was not physically harmed, the brothers and sisters and daughters and sons of others have been, including someone I know.		Thousands of people may be traumatized as well.
I am personally affected by the shooting today, but you don’t need to be personally affected to realize that there are actions we can take to prevent so many school shootings from occurring and to demand change to begin.
@kurteichenwald It was my high school, and that of my sister. It is now that of my brother.		I got a text from my little brother saying he loves me and didn’t realize until later his expression of love wasn’t for Valentine’s Day.		He’s safe, but someone I know died.		I can’t even right now.

@SouljaTroy1996 Well, yeah, sure, could be worse
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Oh wait, I guess I was initially. Sorry, that was unnecessary :P
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Hey, look, some agreement. I'm glad I wasn't too rude to you. Cheers mate. 😉
@SouljaTroy1996 "Very low" is quite the exaggeration	Meanwhile, in the states, I'm thanking the FSM I'm still on the health insurance of my parents.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker I'm socially libertarian and I generally think markets should be as free as possible while accounting 4 negative externalities, tragedies of the commons, welfare, fraud, etc.		I'm libertarian in the sense of that political compass, but I'm not quite sure how 2 label myself fully.
@SouljaTroy1996 Plus, I think the government should cover healthcare (equality of opportunity) and increasing access to healthy food that counters the loss of happiness from less meat could balance things out somewhat by decreasing healthcare costs.
@SouljaTroy1996 I mean, or just increase access without decreasing subsidies, I just meant that as a realisitic source of funding.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker I don't label myself as one. You assumed that.		I should hope that anyone who wants a free market cares about negative externalities affecting nonhumans, however.
@SouljaTroy1996 Not necessarily
@SouljaTroy1996 ......	-subsidize animal agriculture MORE if major welfare reform was enacted to help price change be more gradual	-etc.
@SouljaTroy1996 I think there are solutions to that.	-increase accessibility of hunting/fishing (yes, ik, not everyone has the time or ability)	-take government money out of subsidizing animal agriculture and put it into increasing access to healthy, enjoyable food for the poor	......
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker (2/2) also "force poor people to have even worse stuff" through government action.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker You do realize I'm economically left, right?	I do think markets should be as free as possible. I think there are many things governments need to make sure are accounted for (welfare, negative externalities, etc.)		I was just pointing out that safety regulations in factories (1/2)
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker I care more about animal suffering than the enjoyment of animal products by people.
@SouljaTroy1996 It would only lower poorer human living standards in that something that provides enjoyment would be less accessible.
@SouljaTroy1996 I think there should be revolutionary change in animal welfare standards (or gradual, though larger changes sooner are preferable). I think it'd be rather unfair to tax meat when I want this.
@SouljaTroy1996 No. I think animal welfare standards should be raised regardless of the economic impact.		It just so happens it'd make animal products more expensive. I don't see a need to tax meat when we can raise welfare standards—which I want anyway.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Wait, so you DO disagree with worker safety protection? 🤔
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Idgaf. Animal welfare shouldn't be sacrificed for cheap animal products just like cheaper factory products shouldn't come at the cost of worker safety.
@SouljaTroy1996 Boo hoo, they don't need it. Do you you think caviar should be affordable for all?
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Poor become poorer? What? You don't need animal products, sillybuns. Rich people often have huge TVs and expensive cars too, deal with it.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Good thing you don't need animal products, eh?
@GSpellchecker And/or pay for environmental damage (waste runoff, methane emissions, etc.) (though taxing methane emission could be unfair without addressing other GHGs/methane sources)
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker You think animal welfare should be sacrificed for money? You're a terrible person.
@GSpellchecker I think a better thing to do would be to implement stronger and stronger animal welfare standards that make the cost of production go higher and higher :)

@EqualRightsAdvo But yes, for most Americans, it's a matter of personal choice because they do have the means to follow a vegan diet with proper nutrition.
@EqualRightsAdvo Yeah, but then there's the people in the middle of cities without access to fresh vegetables eating cheap meat.	Though, of course, if meat production had to account for negative externalities and avoid all abuse then the anti-capitalist argument would likely weaken.
@AtheistRepublic  https://t.co/rsjGFdyAtb
@EqualRightsAdvo @PeterIceland8 Yeah, I call myself vegan but eaten eggs a couple of times since becoming vegan when I knew 4 sure they come from happy, non-abused chickens (from backyard chickens I saw 1sthand &amp; from the chickens of a guy at a farmer's market w/ vids/pics of the cuties &amp; their living area)
@EqualRightsAdvo People in food deserts, rural Alaska, etc. don't necessarily have access to food that allows for a cheap vegan diet with proper nutrition.		One could definitely make a good anti-capitalist argument with regard to urban food deserts at the very least
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen Yes, I am very glad for that. Any improvement is good. Not right to hold the competition in the KSA though (or to hold any in Iran).

@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen Sorry for not being clear, I was including marital rape as "beating" (looking back, that was silly of me). I should have said make "all domestic violence illegal," not "make beating of spouses illegal."		Have a good day, best wishes improving the KSA (I assume u live there)
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen I hope it will improve as well. First steps include making the beating of spouses illegal &amp; ending guardianship. I would love 4 the KSA to be a great country. Heck, if it allowed freedom of speech and thought etc., secularized, &amp; became egalitarian by law, it'd be way &gt; USA
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen And besides death, there are the more more prevalent punishments of imprisonment and torture (beating). And yes, I'd call corporal punishment torture anywhere, whether it takes place in the USA or the KSA.		And I haven't even mentioned legal wife-beating and marital rape.
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen Ahmad Al-Shamri is likely going to be murdered by the KSA. I say "murder" because he did nothing wrong.

@pretendods2 People spout out, say, the mongoloid, negroid, etc. crap ALL THE TIME.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead (Or if you want other people to purposely avoid any of that)
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead If you are only attracted to people who look a certain way that is not racist. If you are purposely avoid dating/fucking/marrying/reproducing with people based on what you perceive their "race" to be because you feel it'd be wrong then you're a fucking racist.
@pretendods2 No, they don't "all mostly say the same thing."	https://t.co/xi9K74JDfV
@pretendods2 All are based on grouping people together. Treating people as individuals without any prejudice based on groupings renders racism impossible.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead SJWs tend to be racist.
@pretendods2 (2/2) physical characteristics they associate with particular groups of people cannot be a racist. 		And just because "race" is subjective doesn't mean people don't treat people differently based on their personal view of "race."
@pretendods2 Racism and race are both arbitrary and subjective. That doesn't mean racism doesn't exist or that everyone is a racist. All definitions of race hinge on grouping people. Someone who treats everyone as an individual and harbors no prejudice based on perceived (1/2)
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead No, it just means racism is broad. Someone can be racist against everyone with darker skin than them. Someone can be racist against ethnic Poles but not racist against ethnic Germans. Someone can be racist against the Tutsi but not the Hutu.
@pretendods2 Thing is, whether or not you say I am others disagree.
@pretendods2 You apparently don't know what "objective" means. If there were an objective definition of "white," then you could tell me if I'm white or not. If I'm supposed to decide for myself, THAT'S SUBJECTIVE
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead *perceived physical characteristics or behavior
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Someone who treats people differently based on perceived "race" or perceived physical characteristics that the person associates with a certain group of people is a racist. People can be racist in different ways because of different definitions.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead You are seriously claiming objectivity when you can't even tell me whether or not I'm "white."
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead YES IT IS	If you cannot say whether or not I am white, IT'S SUBJECTIVE	Also, does preventing "the white race from disappearing" involve "whites" only making babies with other "whites?" Wanting people to do that is racist as fuck.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead I don't see why anyone should give a flying fuck about a social construct "disappearing"
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead It's completely subjective whether or not I'M "white." Some people say I am, some people say I'm not. There's no biological definition.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Ok, fine, I'll potentially strawman you.		Why is it that I'm not "white" as an Ashkenazi Jew if my skin is light?	Why does "black" work in collectively referring to people of Sub-Saharan African groups that have far more genetic diversity than is in Europe?
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead My point relies upon you answering questions so I can point out where you use subjectivity.

@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Everyone has a different answer, so...
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead If you don't like that question, then what is "the white race?"
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead I'm asking because it's a subjective term.

@Perfect_Gntlman @theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain I don't view children (or any females) as "candy to be consumed."		When it comes to women, idgaf, showing skin or not isn't "spoiling."
@Perfect_Gntlman @theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Ty for helping to make my point about how covering children is sexualizing
@akhitee @theycallmeNunya @DZisaak @MuslimInterista @affhussain Not what I said.	Bikinis aren't necessarily sexualizing.

@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain I thought you muted me? 😂
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain (So the covering has everything to do with sex)
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Exactly, but that's the reason in any culture/religion that young children are made to cover up.
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain But it does... the hiding of adornment is not necessary in front of "their women" but males with same treatment are specifically labeled
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain This is the 21st century CE, not the 1st
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain *is rooted in being about sex
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain It's about sex. Not every person's choice to cover up is about sex, but the practice, in any religion or culture, is about sex
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain https://t.co/PTaw0WALIZ
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain So you're saying a kid's body is inherently sexual. That's sexualizing 🙄
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Why are women supposed to cover in front of "male attendants with physical desire" but not those without? 🤔
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain You are the one who reduced things to sex. You responded to me saying literally the opposite: that it's NOT all about sex
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain Covering up a kid because people find them sexually attractive is sexualizing
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain https://t.co/PTaw0WALIZ
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Wearing a bikini doesn't say that necessarily 🙄	You have outdated views on "modesty."
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain The fact that you miss my point is telling. Skin isn't necessarily sexual. Ask any naturist.
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain Bikinis aren't necessarily sexual while covering up because of males finding one sexually attractive IS
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Not necessarily the second one. Depends on context.	First one is specifically shielding men from their bodies
@MuslimInterista @affhussain @theycallmeNunya Free mixing?
@MuslimInterista @affhussain @theycallmeNunya Porn is watched worldwide	Telling children to cover up sexualizes them
@MuslimInterista @affhussain @theycallmeNunya Sex crimes are not at an all time high. They are reported more because of less stigma. Also, most of the Muslim world allows marital rape.

@AU5710 @JessieJaneDuff @Harvard Idk, but it'd be pretty funny to watch Berkeley try to deal with such a situation.
@AU5710 @JessieJaneDuff @Harvard Sure, maybe. She IS making a name for herself as an activist tho, and not like still in prison.
@AU5710 @JessieJaneDuff @Harvard But, then again, she's a "punch the Nazis" type of person, def would want to immediately take her down if she called for violence.
@AU5710 @JessieJaneDuff @Harvard Idk, I don't know enough about what she was going to talk about/Harvard's policies. Certainly, she could be interesting.
@AU5710 @JessieJaneDuff @Harvard Probably. However, it just so happens that many ideas people have are bad on points of fact or basic human rights.
@AU5710 @JessieJaneDuff @Harvard In gender studies and crap like that, yeah, sure. Not that that stuff has much of an impact anyway.

@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Bob says gay people are ok. Bob is better.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Ok. A god just spoke to me. One supreme god, named Bob. Bob says I am his first and only prophet and that Allah isn't real. Do u believe me?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Actually, it's different from Islam.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Do you go around telling Jews and Christians that they're Muslims? Lmfao
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman just remembered something you might find interesting: Bahá'í believe the same thing (supreme, too great to comprehend) why r u not a Bahá'í?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman *that.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman But, in any case, it is laughable to claim that Jews and Christians today are Muslims. You can't naskh your way out of thatz
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Ik the Quran says that, but it doesn't make sense to refer to Jews/Christians separately from Muslims yet claim their prophets as Muslim
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman أهل الكتاب	≠	Muslim or follower of Islam
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Jews don't accept Mohammed and have not said the shahada. They are not Muslims. Mohammed himself distinguished Jews from Muslims.
RT @LetHumanismRing: #California won't demand #Jail 4 women convicted of consensual #sex with 4 #Profit, why is it #Illegal at all? https:/…
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman So, you DO admit that Jews aren't Muslims?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman What? You said they're Muslims. Why would a Jew have to say the shahada to become a Muslim if he's already a Muslim?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman *sigh* so you agree that Jews and Christians don't follow Islam?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Why would Jews/Christians need to be converted to Islam if they are Muslims?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman *Christians
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Jews and Chrisitians have not said the shahada, unless apostates of Islam...
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Why Sunni? Even if you don't wish to classify yourself, there are key differences. You can't follow every form of Islam simultaneously.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman ...ok, I have no idea how to respond to that. For the sake of argument, I'll agree" Islam is correct. Which sect/branch/order do u folllow?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman So you're saying that Christians and Jews are Muslims?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Are you saying that prior to Mohammed, every Jew was a Muslim?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman You're free to claim Mohammed is the last prophet, but he founded Islam.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Islam came after Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, etc.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman I'd love to be convinced of Allah's existence if he exists. Arguments for theism don't cut it though, I'm looking for arguments for Allah.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman I.e. reasons for believing in Allah just as valid applied to Brahma(n) are a waste of time to discuss
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Why Islam and not Hinduism is a simple way to get to specific reasons for Islam
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman I'd like to know the reasons you believe in your particular god, and reasons that other people use for other gods would be silly, so asking—
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman On a side note, which branch/sect/order of Islam do you follow?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Hinduism came first. But, I'll throw you a bone: Why are you not a monotheistic Hindu praising Brahman, just as unknown physically as Allah?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman 2/2 	Then you shouldn't have a problem with his image being known.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman It's in ahadith, but I see plenty of Islamic scholars explaining it away. Let's roll with that--as it doesn't matter. If Brahma is real, 1/2
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman That's quite a lot of description, lol
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Do you not believe Allah created man in his own image?

@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug ---when praising people who owned slaves/supported slavery instead of praising specific deeds.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug I hate it :P	And don't want anyone to ever forget how terrible it is and that it still exists today.	And to remember how others may feel---
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug On that: no idea :P
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Oh boy. Uh. He was a big-time adulterer. Sorry :P
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug - was to protest civil rights and to intimidate the oppressed in the late 19th/20th century
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug ...having things added to elevate those they oppressed above them. I don't mind removal too much though, as the whole point of most of them-
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug For WM, I think something should be added, like memorial to his slaves.	For confed stuff, I don't want destruction but moved to museums/...
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Plenty of people were abolitionists at the time (besides slaves) https://t.co/UArx7c95pV
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw Concerning the statues/memorials and removing them. Context of Washington Monument and such differ immensely
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw --a real democracy (as you said, it developed over time)
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw For such things, I much prefer to focus on what people did rather than praise people. I get what you mean, but it's not like US started as--
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug ...see it as kinda weak. If someone raided Mt. Vernon and tried to free his slaves, would Washington have defended his property? I think yes
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Yeah, so my point is your first difference doesn't really make sense since he wasn't trying to end slavery :P	The second is better, tho I...
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw Btw, I do think there r diffs, but it's most clear in the context of creation of confed statues/etc: to protest civil rights &amp; 2 intimidate
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw That sounds ruder than I meant it to (tongue-in-cheek), my apologies

@catspecter I think it best to not leave Native Americans out of the picture.
@catspecter Your analogy is just terrible. I disagree with the point too though. On slavery, they are equatable. And on founding the country...
@catspecter (Washington freeing some after death does not count, btw)
@catspecter Did Washington or Jefferson release their slaves? Y/N	Did Schindler spend his entire fortune on saving Jews? Y/N
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr The "he freed his slaves in his will" thing sounds a lot like you're trying to make his slave-owning sound better...
@catspecter How? What did Schindler do that he disn't counteract? He gave fricken everything. Washington/Jefferson did not.
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr *wouldn't excuse him
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr ...read the website, silly. It says he personally owned 123 slaves. He did not free them before he died. He wrote that into his will
@catspecter Wait a second... LMFAO https://t.co/YHw01KBsJe
@catspecter Wow, nice lack of nuance there. He risked his own ass bribing and lying to Nazis and he spent all his damn money on the people he saved.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw No, you aren't following what I was referring to.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw is a different topic.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw "GW couldn't resolve slavery &amp; also form a country"	I was responding to that. Whether or not the foundation of USA is worthy of celebration—
@ofctimallen We ARE apes.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw And slave-owning is a bit of a big fucking deal
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw Unrealistic for what purpose?
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug *might have
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug If he would have, then why didn't he free his slaves?
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug I know, but I wasn't talking about diff b/t W and Lee
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Saying "couldn't resolve slavery" made it sound like you were suggesting that Washington would have ended slavery had he the chance.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug I was pointing out something that had nothing to do with the founding of the country and whether or not it allowed slavery.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug That has nothing to do with Washington.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Not an excuse. At all.
@MargaretBenett @tribelaw He was a SLAVE not a 'slave'
@catspecter @tribelaw The context of the confed memorials/statues being erected is diff tho. Was to protest civil rights and intimidate, &amp; Trump misses that.
@catspecter @tribelaw Did Schindler murder Jews, Romani, etc.?		Washington and Jefferson owned slaves. Jefferson was a rapist. Neither deserve honor.
@slidewinding @AltGenWash @tribelaw How sweet /s
@AltGenWash @tribelaw You were a greedy, evil, hypocritical piece of garbage. You were an important historical figure. You were not someone to be venerated.

@edelman_barbara @tribelaw And then they lived happily ever after /s
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug GW personally owned slaves.
@SusanDeSanti @tribelaw Cuz that totally made everything alright /s
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr Bullshit. He personally owned &gt;100 slaves when he died.	Also, even if he had freed all a bit before dying, that doesn't excuse him.
@SheilaABaker @tribelaw He's right for the wrong reasons.
@firstlastsecond @tribelaw Did Arnold own slaves?
@MolecularVision @tribelaw Except that didn't change their private ownership of slaves. Jefferson even raped his.
@GChernack @tribelaw Why should we venerate either?
@SisterChromatid @Nuclear_jelly47 @colin_douglas @Jayareadk44 @gilbertjasono There are many Trump supporters who were swayed by Trump's bs about helping them economically. You were correct in saying "at min complicit"
@MisterGilmore @tribelaw One important diff is a lot of confed statues/memorials/etc. were put up in late 19th/20th century to protest civil rights &amp; intimidate ppl
@MisterGilmore @tribelaw Not to mention that giving patriotism points for founding of USA ignores genocide against Native Americans
@tribelaw @Reid_CO ...add stuff to make the evil clear, like, maybe stick a memorial to Washington's slaves in front of Washington Monument
@tribelaw @Reid_CO something to celebrate. But yes, there is a diff between the two. I don't think we shud honor either tho. Don't need to remove stuff, but...
@tribelaw @Reid_CO Getting down to it though, the colonization of America and founding of USA was built on genocide of Native Americans, not necessarily (1/2)
@SisterChromatid @Nuclear_jelly47 @colin_douglas @Jayareadk44 @gilbertjasono Someone can be a Trump supporter and not racist. Call them complicit as much as you like, but calling them all racist simply isn't true.
