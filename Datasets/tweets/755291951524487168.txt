@Dolloutfitters Unfortunately when it comes 2 pregnancy, telling the men 2 take responsibility for their actions only goes 1/2 way. I was a bit judgmental toward women in my tweets, I regret that but I don't want to delete cause some good conversations have come of it.I Want women to value self
@pray2pesci I'm down w/ removing the stigma, being responsible to use the contraceptive is the part that needs the most attention, where I live &amp; a lot of places in the US condoms are free at social service health clinics, also foam, female condom, pill, IUD, day after pill w/nurse visit
@pray2pesci The new bill in NY and the one they tried to pass in Virginia, just got me going I guess. I will admit coming down on the women who choose this is not a compassionate or empathetic if I'm hoping they will make a different choice because I've seen the pain it causes them later.
@pray2pesci I never said it should be illegal, only that I don't want my tax dollars paying for it if it is not a necessary medical procedure. I have had several friends who have had abortions, later in life they were heartbroken when they realized it was a life that they would never know.
@JedIAm4 Oh and if by R's you mean Republican, I am neither an R or a D, I evaluate each position and each person for that position as individuals those I feel best represent my views get my vote. I think healthy is somewhere in the middle of the two. I support issues on both sides.
@JedIAm4 Why do people always miss the point I didn't say they can't have one I said I don't consent to paying for it. In most cases it is an elective procedure fat people can't get liposuction with govt funds, itty bitty titty ppl can't get an augmentation so why abortions.
@IndKingCountyWA Why does it have to be one or the other, why would you attribute such a haneous position to me, I never said such a thing. You are not kind as your profile indicates. Check your heart it think it lacks a beat.
@AlisonLew Just because I voiced that I do not consent, doesn't mean I will get my way, now does it? So sure share your list I am sure there are places we actually agree we don't want out money spent. But there are also places we can just agree to disagree. This may be one of them.
@pray2pesci I'm good with sex. Love it actually, get plenty of it, I just believe both people involved should be consenting and responsible is that so difficult these days, to be responsible for your actions and not demand that others pay for your irresponsibility.
B4 u jump my shi* I am allowed in a free society 2 not consent 2 things I disagree with. U are welcome 2 add your comment but no need to be an as*hole, we can just agree 2 disagree on the matter. U can donate ur $ where u want &amp; I can voice my not consenting 2 pp getting mine.
@MSScienceWizard @johnnymac2220 Please tell me how people on govt. Medical can get an abortion without using my tax dollars to cover their govt paid medical, I know they are not supposed to be able to but I have brought a friend for an abortion 2 times with govt funded medical and they paid 4 it both times.
@johnnymac2220 Apparently you didn't understand the term extenuating circumstances, there is only so much that can go in a tweet but rape, incest, medical emergency, fetal death, mother's life/health is at risk, these are a majority of extenuating circumstances. Rape is always an exception.
@LaurieEdgar1 @JedIAm4 @DetroitLove88 Actually I have escorted a few friends who have used their services, when they needed pregnancy prevention products they got them free from dshs(social service office) cancer screens &amp; breast exams at their regular Dr. Office, so the only reason they needed Pp was abortion.
@Honey74707549 True however I don't see abortions as being a necessary medical treatment except in extenuating circumstances, most times it is elective and last time I checked, elective medical treatment wasn't covered by the govt.
@NoSacredCow60 Neither do I actually. I think people should be responsible and not get pregnant/get someone pregnant if they cannot afford to take care of their children. That being said, I do not support universal healthcare, welfare and the like, I support strong morals and hard work.
@Dolloutfitters Because the men don't decide if the woman is willing, if that were the case I cite extenuating circumstances. I agree both people need to be responsible, however it is also not up to the man involved when the decision to abort is on the table.
As a tax paying citizen, I do not consent to my tax dollars supporting an organization that murders unborn babies. If women Don't want a baby they can keep their damn legs closed! Baring extenuating circumstances, if you can't be responsible about sex, refrain from having it. https://t.co/xNQEXpoHB3

@LBaptisia @jerrylmassey @johnnymac2220 @KyleKashuv Actually it was more like deliver and  resuscitate and keep it comfortable and the mother and dr. can decide what to do next. Implying it could go either way after birth depending on what the mother wants.
@_xerinleighx_ @KyleKashuv Are you calling it fake news, this new bill proposed? https://t.co/ATCWJYUeNK or did you even look for information on it? Abortion ok up to the moment of birth.
@that_trap @KyleKashuv Within the US, adoption, give custody to family, friend or couple hoping to adopt even at the very least don't wait until the fetus has a brain then they can actually feel the pain of being ripped out of the uterus piece by piece.  If outside US, not our business.
@LadyRedWave Do those who condone this behavior(late term abortions-any abortions) really think that making it legal will ever make it moral?

@realDonaldTrump , @SpeakerPelosi gave her press conference today, at 26 mins she says there won't be any $ for the wall, it's time @POTUS to shut it down, use your executive powers to have our military build the wall. Then EO a temp immigration hold pending immigration reform.
@scottschrey @RealCandaceO They have come up with a new bill regarding this in another state I can't recall which one it was on a c-span session of congress regarding this new bill where the woman promoting it is asked what if the mother is 40 wks and in labor can it still be done? She said yes.

@AOC 1 serious question, can u please reply. 	How can 1 be morally correct if their position is based on fabricated info, ie not based in facts but rather based on an opinion a lie or fabricated information? u don't like it when media reports lies, when it seems morally correct.
No more cutting in line, violating our laws and demanding care from Americans by those who do not share our values, violate our laws with sustain and demand, without putting in the required effort, that they receive what hard working people have earned.

How can one be morally right if their morals are based on fiction? If your morals are based on lies not facts then they are not moral. You cannot have morality without truth.

@quagmyrehk @RealJamesWoods The kid who was attacked was being provoked by the other so he would react and give the attacker a reason, had he reacted and the attacker end up on the floor, the rest of the gang feels justified to beat this boy to death.

@Str8DonLemon @GOP Who is they who think I'm racist.
@Str8DonLemon @SenatorTimScott @GOP Not sure where we went off track, I agree with you on much of your posts. Also white people do have culture, it may vary from family to family but my families culture goes back many generations.
@Str8DonLemon @SenatorTimScott @GOP Agree completely and the white male most specifically.
@gatewaypundit @ScottPresler So, with this spoon I must stir the pot, anyone who would like to join me can stir with me. I snipped a pic of the post from the article and posted it back to FB as a pic and we will see if it gets flagged as hate speech also. feel free to share. https://t.co/q8rXIveCKh

@Str8DonLemon Why do you choose to lump all @GOP individuals into one category with regard to their beliefs on race? BY doing so, you are saying that since Tim Scott is racist, everyone who identifies as Rep/GOP is by association also racist. Is this ideology not party bias? https://t.co/Utpkeoyf0n
@Str8DonLemon @SenatorTimScott @GOP The problem is not the use of "Western Civilization", it is the way he conflated "white supremacy, white nationalist &amp; western civilization' as all the same and defends them all as ok. It is ok to have pride in your cultural/ethnic roots just not ok to feel superior because of
@SenatorTimScott I certainly do not like how he conflated "White supremacy,white nationalist &amp; Western civilization" America may have been conquered &amp; founded as a country by men of mainly "white" skin, but a majority of Americans of "white" skin do not consider themselves superior but equals

@WealthcareFGInc @RealCandaceO Thank you, I appreciate you sharing your source, it is difficult to discuss any matter such as this if we do not agree on the data or the validity of the source of info. I will get back to you with my opinion.
@DedreFox What do we do w/ the violent Am. citiz. criminals? Prosecute them according to their crime, those w/ a life or longer sentence should b given an alt. option 2 take an execution pill or work some kind of society supporting job 4 their entire sentence like agriculture. Supervised
@DedreFox Minuscule (:tiny, minute, microscopic, nanoscopic, very small, little, micro, diminutive, miniature, baby, toy, infinitesimal; wee; teeny, teeny-weeny, teensy, teensy-weensy, itsy-bitsy, itty-bitty, eensy, eensy-weensy, tiddly;) as in amount or in comparison to citizens?
@DedreFox No I didn't address the names because the situation is with regard to illegals. 	If they were not here illegally, committing a crime, the crime statistics would decrease accordingly. Approximately 1000 violent crimes a yr are by illegals when 1 is to many 1000 is unacceptable.
@DedreFox R U saying because there are fewer illegals than citizens their % in prison will be higher? Anyhow I can see where we begin to disagree, U say illegals do not commit a lot of violent crime, correct? I feel those who are here illegally should be committing 0 violent crime.
@AOC A fool is only made known when they open their mouth and speak. You are a young, pretty new face in politics, but when you speak, those who actually listen can clearly see that is all you are. When you accuse others of lies, be sure your own mistruths cannot be made public.

@wdunlap @edgar_281_713 @TomiLahren Yep, same here I joined the military for the opportunity many who were here illegally were offered.

@DedreFox Our prisons should house american criminal idiots and not those who are here illegally. Based on real crimes not illegal status 20% being illegal when they are 3.3% of the population in america is disproportionately high. Illegals who commit crime should be deported, many are.
@DedreFox What is your particular source so we can both agree it is a reliable source of info. then discuss the data. Pew research, DOJ, DHS, Bureau of Prisons &amp; US census have the #'s at 20-30% illigals in fed prison when they are 3.3% of us pop. the other 70-80% US born &amp; legal alien.

@RealJamesWoods So according to this article 1.5 million who are transgender will lose some legal protections if this becomes the legal definition, what legal protections do transgenders have that regular Americans don't have, that they would lose? Sounds unjust to protect only transgender ppl.

@CNNOpinion Eric Liu, you wrote an opinion piece on Why are hispanics identifying as White? I have a  few questions,  What is white as in whiteness and what does it mean to "become white" as you term it? Wouldn't it be nice if race wasn't on the census but language were instead.
@CNNOpinion @DriverWrites The very first line of this article is an opinion. You list the weakest of the population as the majority of people in this caravan and they aren't capable of walking 100's of miles yet these people already have?? Not buying it. Grandma didn't plow thru the Mexican border gates.
@CNNOpinion @WednesdayMartin What if men did? Really, I can't even identify with a person who would use their intimate status as a weapon and to promote such an act is ridiculous. People who are so offended by the comment made by Trump a lot of years ago are the reason society is  so sexually confused.

@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly As it was explained to me, that is how it worked but I am learning new stuff everyday and I am certainly open to hearing the truth if I am misinformed.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly As indicated, I spend about what is billed so the only reason to pay for ins is in case of er ie hospitalization. I have had sx and been hositalized a few times and it always came with a multi k out of pocket deductible left over after ins picked up their 80% so I do see the cost
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Honestly I do strive to make others laugh/smile, but that was a realistic assessment of cost and paid medical. So since I am missing something, please enlighten me with the truth as I do realize I am not all knowing about all things, there is always room to learn more
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Again I apologize for the tone of my initial comments. I thought I was awake and was trying to wake others only 2 find that I was still in a dream. I have had a new experience, in the blink of an eye. I sense hostility, impatience, intolerance in your replies. can we start over?

@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Ins co is making $$ or they wouldn't be in the ins business. Medicare sets the cost of medications, govt regulates ins co to blanket the cost if meds and regulates what ins co can charge for premium ins co contracts w/med facility to agreed billing amounts. 1 owns 2 &amp; 3. 1makes$
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly My costs are offset by my husbands. Insurance co. collects from those who see doc reg and those who don't the cost are the same but one offsets the other. premiums are invested ins co makes $ on what is not being spent at the time, also ins co/pharma/med facilities all 1 entity
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly My husband costs are the same but never needs to see doc so insurance is for emergency/unexpected illness. Together we spend 18% of our  yearly income on medical, most of which is billed under me as I have the major illness and see doc regularly.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly I'm not sure what you pay for insurance, I pay 6K in premiums+a 7k out of pocket deductible before insurance put in a dime employer pays additional 6K thats 19K a year for me alone. I have Asthma, insurance is for emergency mostly, cost is close to billed each year.
I do not give my consent. I am awake, though groggy, need more "coffee" and "Crumbs" I'm here to do my part, been doing all along was just unaware of how important it was. I guess i was on the scenic route, so happy to know the plan is coming together. WWG1WGA
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Ok, so what exactly am I missing? I don't need a bridge I don't live in Brooklyn.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Oh honey, I pay for my own insurance, out of my own income, through my own job where the government taxes my personal income then uses those tax dollars to help pay4 medical insurance utilized by those who receive medical assistance thru the govt. at little or no cost. I get it.
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 Agreed, I don't advocate 4 it 2 be outlawed, I do feel that outside extenuating circumstances it should be a last resort. I personally believe that the ability to create &amp; grow inside your body, another life, is a gift given to Women not to b taken lightly.
@RepHankJohnson, Hello, I am checking with you before I decide if this is "FakeNews" as not only do I not want to succumb to being lead to believe this is true if in fact it is is not. Please confirm or deny https://t.co/wv4i1WFxA9 thank you. Sincerely
@Grymm219 @2021_free @realDonaldTrump Havre you found a verifiable link that is in english? Please feel free to share. Not a news article but a statement of record from someone through the peace prize organization. All the links in the articles are to other unverifiable articles &amp; I did not see it on the PP website.
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 You misunderstand, I don't want to pay for any medical procedures,dr visits, medications, treatments for you or anyone else besides family in need. Fortunately u r Irish I am American, so I don't. I actually apologize for putting in my 2cents since I am not Irish in it irrevelent
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 Never said I even cared about who or how many peeps you desire to engage in sexual relations with, I said show restraint if you cannot be responsible. Legal abortions are "safer" but to call them safe, is a flat out lie. I  can say as I please, you can choose not to listen.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Correct again, it is not my job to tell others, abstain if they lack judgment regarding the consequences of unprotected sex &amp; are incapable of using conception control properly, just the same as it not my job/responsibility to pay for the consequences of  their actions. Agree?
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 I also apologize to those of you that I offended with my views. That is  not who I want to be. A closed mind always opens the door to anger then to hate. I don't hate women who have abortions nor do I want to punish them. I feel the procedure itself is punishment enough.
@Michelle1Kelly @WildChild69 I concede,it is not my business what a woman or a man chooses do with their body so long as they are not using my $ to do it. As for welfare benefits of any kind, I feel should be on the community &amp; family to assist those in need. Criminals forfeit their rights.

@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly As for facts, here is a fact you can swallow and digest. If you keep a dick from away from your vigina, you won't get pregnant. Show some restraint if you can't be responsible.
@WildChild69 @Michelle1Kelly Ok we can set aside the moral argument of abortion if it helps those who choose that route this still leaves the issue of everyone's tax $used to pay for the irresponsible act of an unwanted pregnancy. No more of my taxes to pay for anyone's birth control. Abstain self control
@culturalfugue @kcampbell4019 @FrostyMcCool @charliekirk11 We simply cannot reasonably afford to take in more people who have no means to provide for themselves, medically, food, housing, education.

@FrostyMcCool @charliekirk11 Not to mention how they will make a great cover for those who intend our demise to slip in under the radar, American's are go broke paying for their medical, food, education, housing. Over crowded schools reduce the quality of our education services as well.

@marie_skou @CharlesMonsen1 Will you humor me this, If left to develop undisturbed, will the fetus become an infant? A human being?
@marie_skou @CharlesMonsen1 I think it might be better stated as "I find it immoral to give birth to an unwanted child" but the mother can always give the child to a loving family. No abortions that are strictly done due to inconvenience, are immoral, selfish, lazy. "responsibility 4 your actions"
@marie_skou Please do not pull the Contraceptive failed line as in testing it nearly never does, in practice it only fails when one is irresponsible and forgets, or uses improperly.
@marie_skou Regulated better, perhaps. Abortion for those old enough to understand how procreation works yet to irresponsible to prevent it and find it inconvenient to carry is just unacceptable. Rape, incest, eminently detrimental to mother's life, fine, but inconvenient, no.
@Michelle1Kelly Perhaps if women,who end up with an unwanted pregnancy, were a more careful with what they choose to put into their bodies or under what conditions the risk of pregnancy are acceptable, they wouldn't have to kill a living being and justify murder by choice.
@becksk Not sure where you live but most places will save the mother over the fetus if her life is is danger.
@JillHealy_ What about all the choices that lead up to conception? Are they not her choice, who she has sex with, what conceptive to use, who is paying for the contraceptive or the choice to abstain on the off chance you will get pregnant? Accountability for your actions. I'm pro-choice too

You must not have seen the videos or been following his fight to survive being taken off life support 45+hrs ago. the hosp is starving him, how is that not suffering.
@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice He may be ill but the hospital, since removing life saving interventions, no longer has a right to claim they are holding him in their care in his own best interests. There is no evidence he is suffering, 44 hrs unplugged and he is still fighting to survive.

@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice By the way, who decides what is quackery? It is not abusive to fight for the life of your child, and if, as you are persuaded, the child is brain dead, who then is being hurt by not releasing the baby to the parents? If he is terminal, what difference is made where he dies?
@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice As for his well being, if he is brain dead he has no awareness of well being nor does he have an awareness of what dignity is. Dignity would be to allow the parents to seek care wherever they choose at their expense no seek court decision to restrict parental rights.
@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice So you think the child is terminal, is brain dead as they claim for reasoning to end his life? if yes, you must concede that, he no longer feels pain as people without brain function cannot process pain, so how does taking him elsewhere to die deny hi,m comfort?
@CraigAmbrose1 @tomaszs2 @MerseyPolice So if he is terminal, why can't the parents take him home to pass, or to another facility? Why were the parents not allowed to remove him the moment the hospital stopped providing life sustaining support? This is just wrong, they should be allowed to seek a miracle anywhere.
@simonhall1974 @DatOtherMichael @MerseyPolice At whose request did the courts intervene? Who got the courts involved and who prevented the parents from removing the child prior to the court order?
@KyleJMayhugh @RBCornell @kee2013_uk @theone20152016 @agileroshi @jezzajwilliams @MerseyPolice The parents have the right to seek 2nd, 3rd opinion, or religious miracle, or to take their "dying" son home to pass on his own in his own environment. Why would any hospital refuse to allow them to seek care elsewhere if they have already condemned him to death, unless foul play

@FitnessScott @StormyDaniels Didn't defend Trump, Simply pointed out that IF she signed an NDA &amp; took money to keep quiet but ended up speaking about it, THEN anything she has to say is questionable because she did not keep to the word. In the end, our word/oath is all we have so breaking it is wrong period.
@DedreFox You probably disagree with my political and moral views so you may want to block me on twitter. Ppl who temp married ppl into cheating are to me the worst of all people right up there with pedophiles and rapists, because they destroy families.
@DedreFox I have been called all sorts of things, many that are untrue, some that are, if i live in such a way as to draw the title Whore, then I can't really complain about being called one. Whore is a person who sells sex for money, so if the title fits, then so be.
Intelligent, refined, well spoken, respectful, kind, and beautiful inside and out our past first ladies, they got nothing on you @IvankaTrump Keep up all the wonderful things you are working on to help out youth, this is how we end school shootings, end the bullying.
@CrowMeris @joelive35 @StormyDaniels So is a person who sleeps with married men, signs an agreement not to talk about it takes money to keep quiet then doesn't keep her word of oath to keep her fat trap shut. Mouth and legs wide open for all. How would anyone trust her.
@FitnessScott @StormyDaniels If she signed a NDA then she is most definitely not doing the right thing. She signed in agreement not to talk, she took the money then she talked, that is a person who cannot keep their word, why believe anything that came from her mouth.
The fact that she knowingly signed a NDA.(legal or not, she signed and took the money) then didn't keep her word, tells you all you need to know of her character. Since she is willing to try and destroy a family for money and fame, proved she has no morals. Disgusting tramp. https://t.co/fL0v29mOZM

@d33ness72 @virt @theashbhat @LiLiTsunTsun @jlwAUS @WalterHorsting @jonahfreedman @MSR_Future Yep I got the same response and if you deny you are a bot then that means you are a bot
@LilMadBenMax @virt @LiLiTsunTsun @jlwAUS @WalterHorsting @jonahfreedman @MSR_Future @TwitterSafety But the program is flawed and to call a person a bot because you don't like their opinion won't solve the fake news problem. By the way, real person here but not according to this program
@jlwAUS @virt @theashbhat @williamlegate @LiLiTsunTsun @WalterHorsting @jonahfreedman @MSR_Future That would be better than having real authentic users be black listed because it allows a person to post if others are bots and in at least a few cases, it has been wrong. I think that the program needs to confirm before allowing others to post that a real person is a bot.

@theashbhat @robhatlabs @BartKwan @philipwang @real_tiff @davidsocomedy @Geo_Antoinette @JKFilms Perhaps cover more carefully, as your program is allowing people to post others as bots who are actual people. When your information is unconfirmed, it should not be able to be posted as it is slanderous, libelous, abusive, insulting and malicious
@CBSNews @robhatlabs This site propagates fake results, as it indicates I am a bot which I am not, now people have decided to post the results to twitter, I'm feeling like they are headed toward a lawsuit if they don't refine their program to confirm an account b4 allowing others to post results.
@Cal @robhatlabs @theashbhat Not impressed, I'm not a bot but your site won't allow me to correct your opinion, so now I am requesting you direct it.
Botcheck is inaccurate, if you rely on their program you will be misinformed. https://t.co/RfBd17etaG
@theashbhat @robhatlabs I find it irresponsible to classify a person as a bot when you have not confirmed that they actually are. Since anyone can put in any name and your site will say weather their account is likely a bot, and since I am not but your site disagrees, I say faulty analytics, bad program
@JonGordon49 @adage @robhatlabs @theashbhat I must agree they failed and are pissing off real people. Also there is no ability to contact on their website. I think they are the bot
@theashbhat According to your analysis, I am a bot., which I am not. When I go to your site to correct the information it will not allow me to contact you, so How exactly can one correct this info.
@IamTheRealJoan Oh, ok I get it now. I'm sorry I didn't realize you are dealing with your mental illness. All is forgiven, but just so you know the app  that tells you who is a bot is not correct, as I  am actually a person.

@lynncampm @jwall1955 @1994Nolan @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump How about this, FACT: gun ownership in America has gone down DRASTICALLY over the years. Gun laws have been put in place maybe you should read them, get some personal perspective because reality is "less guns=more gun deaths" No Gun Zone= Killing spree
@1994Nolan @jwall1955 @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump If this young person had one adult, one friend or a few random students asked him "are you okay man do you need someone to talk to?"instead of just pointing the finger and saying "he's going to be the next one to shoot up the school!" how was that helpful? The Community knew him!
@1994Nolan @jwall1955 @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump Because there was a time once when parents teach their children compassion on one another and empathy and understanding. A time when it was encouraged to help a friend in need even if they weren't your friend but they were in need. A time when we reached out to those hurting.
@1994Nolan @jwall1955 @laura_gripp @realDonaldTrump Because as the old adage goes and most people have forgotten "it takes a village to raise a child".. so if the community The Village knew this poor childs situation that they lost their parents,  felt like an outsider then it was The Village responsibility to help this boy.

@LynSimpson9 @LilMissDiabla @MalliardReport Yes, however many Americans are tired of corporation's not paying their workers a working wage. The owners who employ illegals should be held to a higher standard and made to pay fair wages. This will never happen if they aren't forced to do so. So It's ok to exploit illegals?
@Cheryl_Renee_ @MalliardReport Wall, wall wall you don't speak for us all. Sorry sweety.
@LynSimpson9 @PTW_Christian @MalliardReport Why do you feel not included as an immigrant? The definition is "a person who comes to live permanently in a foreign country" it doesn't indicate whether it is voluntary. There were many surfs imported to America they are immigrants also.

@SophiaRobot2 Sure. The human body is amazing, it regenerates itself, heals itself and a female human can grow an new human being inside. The most beautiful part about being a woman, growing is an incredible gift.

@SEDahle Really all I'm saying is it's government's job to see to it we aren't being charged ridiculously for medications and medical care.
@SEDahle Yes Jesus did care deeply, he healed the sick but he told each of us to do the same. No health insurance just faith based healing. Simple

@Graceadele @JackJolis @Stevenwhirsch99 @c5hardtop1999 Yes its fine that my property tax pays for public education, just tired of the government getting the credit for what citizens pay for.
@JackJolis @Stevenwhirsch99 @c5hardtop1999 Virtually all the money the federal government "provides", was collected from US citizens, we should stop making it seem like a handout.
@JackJolis @Stevenwhirsch99 @c5hardtop1999 Wait, federal funding? Doesn't  property tax cover school? Part of my property tax covers  schools even though I don't have kids in school.
