Don't yank the pole the first time you see it move wait on them to take the bait. And by God right now you got grandpappy on the line, in the fishing sense. Fishing is an art

@AaronMcInelly please have faith in these things I say for as I mentioned these I am still in the battle at conflict on all sides surrounded by my enemy and without my fellow brothers and sisters my Patriots most surely I will give up and die don't let that happen. Press forward
@AaronMcInelly the world is starting to pay notice to the child trafficking it is only a matter of time before they notice how it happens in their own backyard through DSS how they make money off of every dollar you pay in child support they also get a dollar from the state
@AaronMcInelly I personally have been through the same BS it started in 03 for me I have fought and never stopped soldier i expect you to continue to fight and not give up this war is close to the Apex and we are close to winning please don't give up we are brothers in this fight
@AaronMcInelly do not blame your brothers and sisters ultimately it is the fault of DSS the system is corrupt it is crooked and wrong these are why it is important very important to elect proper people we don't need lawyers in office they get paid no matter what
@AaronMcInelly Sir I read your heartfelt words I too have felt the same and there are people that love you I don't even know you and I love you don't ever feel like you walk alone God is everywhere even in me and I'm the last one I ever thought that would be possible #wwg1wga
17/ Q? How much longer will my people wait? They are tired of waiting I have more patience than they do I know the scope of things but action not words can tell a story sometimes remember who writes the history books.	*Look in their eyes and answer to them. "WHY"?*
16/ These are to be done timely efficiently accordingly justifiably and without delay. Least I remind of the bond. Quick and decisive action will relieve you of this burden and it may relieve me as well.
15/ The higher of the powers has spoken, and has demanded, not asked, these things be fulfilled and they are to be done immediately.
14/ as my means of communicating are limited. So to anything I say is public. I wish not to hide I bask in the light of the Lord Almighty. I offer my hand so you may join us in the light. And put an end to this wrong.
13/ so they are to fulfill any and all of the prior written engagements upon the contract. Full cooperation is expected and deserved.
12/ I signed the contract I am responsible and me alone for any wrongdoings. I relieve my servants or staff of any and all wrong doings. For they do'th not wrong, and neither do I.
11/ I have asked you to go for us only in my name, you are not responsible. You are but a messenger. As such you got my full attention and my full support as well as my full protection.
10/ do you have money to pay a bond? Do you have money to pay (Bale, ba'al, bail)? What bond can you offer me? Are YOU bound that contract? Who holds the contract? Confused yet? Walk the line? What are standards'? What is a barr? What is the difference between X and Y? Chart?er?
9/ why does a judge require a bond? Who is bound? What binds them? Who is responsible if the guilty gets away? Who is going to see it through the justice is served? How did a judge get paid originally?
8/ I pray I shall not have to remind those whom this is intended for, about what I mean. The scales of Justice in this country are a seesaw one man holds the rock where the other stands high. What does God recommend you build upon?
7/ I want all people to be able to do the same. If the scales be tipped I hold the Rock. Are the time has come to remind everyone how the judicial system works and I don't want to be forced to remind of the contract. I was resting and my axe is dull but you awoke me
6/ The time has come, for i know how the contract is written. This I will not keep silent. For I am willing to die for my country and my fellow man. I will not let a tyrant rule my people.
5/;Even in the Bible how was God's name written when he instructed the pharaoh to free his people? #IAM such as the bonds of suffrage in the past, so to they remain today,
4/ you cut the head off the body dies? What if it's not an animal you're dealing with is this still true? How do you enforce a contract? What is the right of a person 'habeas corpus'?
3/ are contracts enforceable? under which code or jurisdiction do they fall? How many snake tongue split tongue silver tongue devil's do you need in one place? How many can stand up to but one? #IAM
2/ How do you get one held accountable for their actions? Due process under the law? Courts require equity what is equity? What is the most valuable of all equity? Who retains the right to that equity? What is a bond? who signs a bond? why what is held in return? Is it a contract

@TomFitton ...as individuals, we are weak, small, and a nat in the ear. Together we are many, we are strong, and WE WIN. Everyone must be onboard, for to beat them at there own rules, not of GOD, of man, it takes great MEN and keen eyes, and sound individual constitution
@TomFitton ...Sir Tom, you know there playbook, they only had 15 days to go to court, as doj was shut down. It stops the judicial Branch. It allowed the dems to gang up and plan, but there plan was already known before they knew it themselves. Win Win Win...

@TomFitton I will openly accuse them, and I will tell them and the world, of their ways and I will remind them of their oath and that contract that they signed, that they wrote, in which they made the rules, and now they must follow them. Ministerial Acts? Refund?
@TomFitton also remember, any verbal attack on you in court or against J.W. is an attack on the People. To attack our Judgement. As you are only a steward of the People. The Messenger. I hoped to not have to interfere, but I guess they need supenia me. I am not afraid
@jaazee1 @IncarnatedET @PressSec ...I pray for humanity. For the spectacle today only revealed the truth, and that truth is; those doing the Questioning, are all GUILTY. May be one or two that isnt, but for the most part, GUILTY. Why didnt they just ask, "am I being investigated?"
@jaazee1 @IncarnatedET @PressSec after today, I think almost everyone in that room, better worry about the intelligence community. HHHMMM, who has the vast knowledge? Who has the Largest Data Base and Citizen Reps? We, yes US, The People, we will expose them, they can expect us

@CoryBooker this changed my words, I said the more freedoms you restrict now, the more you lose later..... last part of previous statement was manipulated and not by me
@CoryBooker look what your' kids or little ones around you, what is their definition of the American Dream? Are you selling them out on it? or are you giving it them? The more freedoms you impose now, the more you constrict and lose later, even your' blood line
@CoryBooker your' part of a generation of only a select few have your' opportunity. Where we knew the world was wrong growing up, but you didnt know quit what it was. You're so close right now to that answer, and you wont just walk away and look around and see for yourself
@CoryBooker if we need to hire a think tank on ever issue, what the hell are you doing? lobbying for them to lead? they corrupt you, and others' and what happens? your' voting for sh*+ you know is wrong, and not voting for what Is right, what we americans want
@CoryBooker 'YOU' Sir; are expected to sit down, READ the Law, Economics, Psychology, Construction, Management, Book keeping, and many others. This is 'YOUR' responsibility, not a cabinet. You're nobody if they lead. Dont let them lie to you, you see the Truth, wake up
@CoryBooker no one has answers to a question havent yet been asked. so to ask a question, then one must ponder and find that answer, not thru lawyers or committee's, but YOU are expected to give the answer. Fear and nerves are expected, with power comes responsibility
@CoryBooker notice theyre pushing the medications and synthic opioids in all platforms right now. they lost their money had in Afghanistan with the poppies, so they must distract you and regroup, look for a new angle. Wake up. I cant waste my time on people who dont listen to their people

@CoryBooker one thing or incident dont effect the entire nation. only the local neighborhood. yes some things are given by GOD Alone, so when you realize this, maybe you'll learn something. Till then, you will remain ignorant and in the dark
@CoryBooker I got your answer, everyone has to quit lying. Quit bs yourself. some people are meant to lead, some aren't. You criticize white people for building a great nation, giving a seat to all ethics and sex's, and parties, and yet its not enough. Help those you can
they claim they want equality, they want laws to enforce bad language or type, that may offend anyone whom isnt a white male. You wonder about the world population, and trying to reduce it, its' the White race these people are trying to extinguise
notice how they judge other countries,, well its time for them to see, that we will hold you, accountable, hey "cory" Booker' him, he's guilty. Look the H in the background. Does that look like a "hospital---&gt;Hillary" sign?  Why do they always hate on White Men?

@RepSteveStivers ..... This encourages family values wow preserving family ties lessening and unlawful burden creates more economy create a better community you could give newly-weds a tax break all new houses that's cheaper than one year's welfare food stamps and HUD
@RepSteveStivers ..... This allows the dad to bond with the child instead of being in jail the state saves money they take in more money because the single man is working he too now can have a girlfriend no woman wants a broke man the system is rigged against us.....
@RepSteveStivers a tax break to encourage marriage would encourage a lot of welfare recipients to marry the boyfriend they don't claim, removing the burden from the state also easing the single Man's burden of child support alimony we don't have a debtors Court.....
@RepSteveStivers sir I think we agree children should live in a structured home you should have passed taxes to encourage more marriage it is causing women to have multiple baby daddies on welfare causing unfair child support for the father's welfare encourages this through ssa
@SenToddYoung allowed newlyweds a tax break on a house or on the apartment that would help it would help him to get ahead in life it would encourage them to get married and doing so the tax break is   5x cheaper than 1 years' welfare and you save young men, dads in kids life
@SenToddYoung give me a tax break will initially cost you a few dollars it should even out almost immediately through welfare but in 3 years it'll quadruple its investment because you have people working and purchasing you didn't buy nothing when you're broke or in jail
@SenToddYoung get Social Services out of our lives there in every part of it in the only outcome is families get divided and the only people who win are the lawyers. It instigates fights because it makes you fight your loved one that's unfair that's not that's not God
@SenToddYoung ..	The woman was previously on welfare, now off, removes a burden off of the state, also it takes a burden off of each one of the dads because it lowers their unfair imposed burden sometimes life is hard families stick together and you have good times and bad
@SenToddYoung my entire generation feels the same way I do men are treated unfair and unjust so you have to use another tactic tax incentives don't increase taxes on single people but give a woman a reason to stay married. When a woman on welfare gets married to the boyfriend...
@SenToddYoung a lot of women with multiple baby daddies receive welfare and child support from multiple dads every night having an unfair burden. Then a woman will move in a boyfriend and not claim it. Reverse the thinking save the household encourage marriage and family
@SenToddYoung one thing with taxes you could do is encourage people to stay married right now Social Services encourages women to have multiple baby daddies and it puts an unfair burden fax through child support unfair jail.

@RepLarryBucshon Social Services needs restructure it's against marriage single man go to jail it destroys their lives, need to make a tax to encourage marriage it would lessen the burden on the single man

(17?) I left 17 out intentionally, because if you are waiting on God to appear personally or que and do this for you see the manager her name is Wait first name Helen so go to Helen Wait
18) I believe in God and I do not like what is called murder but this is not murder this is a cleansing all of the land for all that's holy let God's will be done
16) such as the Lord told Moses this is your holy land that I give them to the go forth and smite all of them let not one of them live least they will defile the
16) put aside your Christian beliefs or embrace them 100% either way God does not want these people to exist they must be exterminated eradicated eliminated
15) anyone can sit around whining about what's wrong but it takes a true hero to stand up say something and at least try to do something
14) these atrocious acts of man upon our brother and our sisters our mothers our fathers our children these things can not be tolerated anymore and must be obliviated
13) don't cower in fear but bask and the joy and the power of the light of the Lord thy God for the Lord has called you will you answer
12) there will be no White Knight to show up and save the day least you look in the mirror and you are that knight
11) this cannot be allowed to go on no more sitting around waiting for someone else to do what you know you must do the time to act is now least you never have grandchildren
10) I say wait no longer time is now to take action least you die from drowning in your own sorrow and your own tears
9) for too long I have listened I have heard the prayers the crying the heart of man weeping begging Lord how long must we wait
8) these acts I speak of are the acts of full term abortion no one in their right mind will tell you this is okay no one will tell you eating people is okay no one especially God
7) no longer can you allow these people to separate us no longer can we take this no longer can these immoral Acts be allowed these people are vermin and must be exterminated
6) to kill our children and rejoice is the spit in my eye I will not have this if you America if you have any more decency you must unite
5) these people are not human they are evil they are wicked they are of the worst kind they are of Satan's spawn and they must be dealt with immediately
4) this has gone on for too long for too long we have sat back and watched we have taken it but no more never again we must unite as one together remember where we go one we go all
3) you must now rise you must put aside your indifference Petty as those indifferences may be, we all believe and the same moral foundations
2) it is war these people desire so it is war these people shall receive. As a man of faith who believes in God, it is now time we can wait no longer
1) #QAnon #Q #IAM It is time, Democrats, Republicans, they try to pin us, the American people, one against the other to be free is to be independent

I actually appreciate this article, its written as if I was looking at it. Weighing both sides. But, GUILTY till PROVEN innocent	Something Different Within The Bruce Ohr Testimony... https://t.co/7iUk85MSYD via @thelastrefuge2
@FBI @CIA @doj We, The People, will protect you. Remember, there is 70million of us with guns. We are America, we keep our word, we protect our own. We can smite thee, or forgive thee, for the LORD is Gracious to us. I can not offer this after the 21st. You have until then , or your' all guilty
@FBI @CIA @doj People have lost faith in you. We made TV shows Glorifying your job. Now you embarrass us as a laughing stock around the world. The narrative changes with sentiment. We know if you come forward too soon you die and your family. Please divulge all! Fear NOT!
@FBI @CIA @doj If you can come forward and say "hey, I really didnt know." Trust me, I KNOW GOD, and I know he will find favor upon you, and release you, IF you cooperate with us. We (this includes you and your' family, that is WE) deserve Justice and Truth. Do you know what they want? I do
@FBI @CIA @doj So you can come forward, and I dont mean as a snitch, thats frowned upon everywhere, but we deserve the truth. So does your family. We got kids too. Your now victim to the same laws you've help us too. So we are compassionate. Some want you to hang, I dont
@FBI @CIA @doj We are America, and we do forgive people. I can understand the pressures. I know they KILL people. We all know this, it isnt like this new news'. Dont lie to us, and tell me what you did and why. So I may understand so as to judge you. For now your Guilty
@FBI @CIA @doj I want to help you if you deserve it. Other wise ALL of YOU go down, and then your' an embarrasment to your' own kids, ashamed to speak your' name, change their last names.... Look your' kids and spose in the eyes, and choose your soul and your histories narrative
@FBI @CIA @DOJ I'm not letting any of you OFF the hook, some are GUILTY, we just dont want to convict those whom aren't guilty and did as they were told, you dont know why or what their agenda is, we know that. U R solution or problem, come forward, explain...
@FBI You swore an OATH, under GOD. To uphold that oath, to protect us SHEEPLE. Well we can see MANY of you were Hood-Winked, if you come forward, I do believe we can forgive most of you. Some of you knew what you were doing, they PAY. Either with or against me.
@FBI How do you want your KIDS', Your' wives', your own family, your in-laws, YOUR' grandkids, the American People... How do you want YOUR' Narrative in history written? When your' gone, we write the narrative. I'm giving you a way out. Take it. Please, I'm a man of GOD
@FBI We all grew up with inner feeling, knowing what the American Dream is. You havent forgot it. We Know Corrupt Bosses lead you astray, and that isnt your' fault, you did your' job, as you were told. You WORK FOR the People, not Against Them. HISTORY?
@FBI Yes, some people are going to pay. That is a FACT! But, you have a choice; which side of History do you want YOUR' kids and grandkids to remember you by? Faithful to the People of America, or the FBI? YOUR' Choice. We are merciful. Please tell us the truth
@FBI To all of you whom are Honest, Mislead, and doing your' job, as you were told, WE #QAnon #USA #QArmy sirs, ma'am's, Remember, we are Christian Nation, built upon those principles so we can forgive. Just come forward. We know you were Hood-Winked

@realDonaldTrump Sir., Why is legal for them to go on vacation, and from what I have read; there was over 100 lobbyist there as well. This 'moon-lighting' has to stop. Do they get in trouble for excepting any gifts? I was almost have to think, some shady business was going on. TY Mr. President
@realDonaldTrump Sir., GET'EM!!!  I Believe you should dock their pay. I don't think they deserve to get paid. For their entire careers they've never worked and they've stole so much. They get full retirements and its not enough for them. #WeAreWithYou

@TomFitton I may have misspoken and these sweets but this is the generalized real principle and I believe I have answers to every question that proves it please look it up
@TomFitton if you got them tweets please do not dismiss them I could do a show all week long about this and I believe I am 100% correct and all aspects..
@TomFitton so wouldn't it'd be like an indentured servant possibly in this case for the right to cross our land and the privilege a freedom they acquired the burden of tax we received the equitable equivalent so the debt is owed to us whites.
@TomFitton also courts don't have jurisdiction and a state they are collecting equity since we don't have to pay equity they have no jurisdiction over us cannot hold up criminally liable or civil for the most part if it isn't a burden or tax or law of Burden
@TomFitton taxes are actually illegal to charge a white person I didn't write the laws Abraham Lincoln did so when they created two classes of Citizen 1868 citizen a we're white citizen B article 14
@TomFitton if you read all these I know he may have sounded corny but if you go where I said that's going to take you a good understanding of many quarts and many laws and many hours but you'll come to this conclusion
@TomFitton with separation of church and state sanctuaries are churches that Encompass the entire area not confined Within only one structure but omnipotent and refugees can be excommunicated
@TomFitton I don't want to do away with a true Sanctuary City and the manner it was intended I don't want the practices they are using at present time
@TomFitton this argument actually can be found and all of those videos it proves the point when you like them together. So the debt are the taxes they owe us as Citizens that's our money they subsidize
@TomFitton because Lincoln created a second artificial USA they fell under art14 and which does not pertain to us for we would have already been citizens we weren't receiving anyting
@TomFitton I do believe I can make the case for that and when if you go on YouTube listen to that gentleman Yusef El I believe he makes every argument on his own for the case I would make
@TomFitton the federal government claimed ownership or adoption of and the FED is owned by the citizen
@TomFitton sir as you're aware of all the different courts and the states I don't think they apply if you're white and you're not in the government they don't apply
@TomFitton people say nothing in life is free and when the slaves were set free it took away from the sovereignty of the citizen so you're entitled to Fair Equitable value for such loss of Rights
@TomFitton see anything we signed before we went into unknowingly therefore we're not bound to that contract but they are bound to pay us
@TomFitton due to the difference in wording language capitalization the slaves had fallen under the Fourteenth Amendment no new burdens upon the citizens we were already citizens
@TomFitton due to the wording they trapped themselves into two sets of laws where we don't fall under the court they don't have jurisdiction I would have to set and go through hours to explain this
@TomFitton see we fall under state law and as the people who make up the state before Article 14 make us eligible to receive part of the tax
@TomFitton there's a lot more to all of this I have listened too many cases the definitions and blacks Encyclopedia of Law whatever its called that don't apply to White
@TomFitton I believe with the contracts and the trust as a landowner allowing others to travel across as it right away you're entitled as a white person to get paid and not have to pay taxes
@TomFitton I believe for the federal government setting free the slaves and creating two classes of citizen they created a lower-class only for the Negro themselves whom fall under the federal law
@TomFitton when the separate laws were signed in 14th Amendment others up 33 1870 119:17 and other acts they were not applicable two white people white people don't fall under 14th Amendment
@TomFitton with that status falling under Church we should have the right to excommunicate them forcing them into the state or the Fed there is a lot to this
@TomFitton Sanctuary States would place them under the Catholic Church due to separation of church and state it would become like the Vatican
@TomFitton I think I can prove under the law with the 14th Amendment if you file correctly white people are privileged and our tax exempt
@TomFitton The more I've seen about law I would like to talk to you once I explained this to you you're going to have a whole different understanding..
@LAW who has the right do Grant sanctuary and a state?  Does the Constitution Express only at church can grant Sanctuary status and under Christian beliefs leaving the church the ability to excommunicate
So what do you do with a sanctuary State you appeal to a local Catholic Church to excommunicate the refugee seeking Refugee status and the Catholic Church therefore supersedes the state for it's considered a church for only a church can grant sanctuary
And if a state being under Sanctuary also falls under Christian it is against Christian faith to allow another faith and the courtroom.....
If I live in a sanctuary state doesn't that fall under the Christian faith that includes the entire boundaries of that state of which it was founded?
