Boy, these @GOP ads are ridiculous tonight. Just saw one where a lady says she was raised with Dem family, parents, etc. but now she says the Dems now don’t rep her #values anymore. 😂😂😂😂😂She just told the world she is #morallybankrupt! 😂Geeez.. #VOTEBLUE #VOTEDEMS #BlueWave
Wow! I just saw a #future45 ad that had more lies about Dems than I could even count. The @GOP is really getting desperate when they can’t say one positive thing abt themselves but will tell 10 lies in a 30 sec ad. Geeez.. don’t fall for this #BS #VOTEBLUE for the future!!

@JLustwerk @maydaymindy9 It was my Mama’s favorite and it’s still mine. Really ripe tomatoes!
My biggest pet peeve is ppl in my home state #AL who have to be told: DON’T GET YOUR NEWS OFF FB! If you insist on doing that, then at least actually fact check it or don’t vote. Be an educated voter! Know WHY you are voting GOP or DEM! Don’t let friends vote stupid! (#VoteBlue)
#AL doesn’t have a state auditor who actually does REAL AUDITS. Ziegler is a hack who calls fake audits “clean audits” even though they don’t even account for any missing/stolen state property. Vote @VoteMirandaJ for Real Oversight of State Money! #ALPolitics Vote Miranda Joseph!
@suevee85 @LCNM99 Geeeez.. he’s demented and morally bankrupt
Have people forgotten it was mostly Saudi terrorists who attacked us on 9/11? Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi’s. It wasn’t an “incident” as Pompeo said. It was a murder. Trump is an embarrassment to the US all over the world.  He is rubber stamping murder.
Supposedly fb is trying hard to fight fake news before the election, but I’m not seeing it. I report clearly fake news on there when I see it and all I get back is “thank you for reporting..blah blah blah..but it’s within our community standards..blah blah blah..🤮🤮🤮🤮
