Like it blocks out the white light that blocks out the full range of depth in your color spectrum so it's like seeing 3D🌈👓🦄
I'm literally in an elevated state of being😎🏵
That would be so chill if they could do that🤝
When you're on the phone for an hour and they just stop responding lol😂
Just making light out of the situation✨🤘🏻
You know exactly what's going on at both times🎆
Why is it so cold in here❄️
Could we just be cool😘
You know👉🏻
I wish🌠
The more I get the more I'm entertained👏🏻🌅

My God, this better not be the last episode🤞🏻🖥️
My hat goes off to all the talented chefs👨‍🍳
@LostInTheVibes I used to be so reckless about it, like I was always getting high on the property and I would just park however the fuck I wanted too and just light up, like it couldn't be more obvious. Forgot to add I had my music blared too, it was so chilling though I didn't give one shit
@LostInTheVibes Yeah getting high in high school was the shit, it was always trippy

@WeeklyChris I haven't fallen asleep all night either and now my dog is in my room barking it's fucking brains out and my mom says I have to keep it in my room while our handyman installs a shower door 🤦‍♂️
OK so I'm mad flowing until my mom comes up with her grand plan to put the fucking dog in my room so I can hear it bark every fucking second why the handyman puts in the new shower door right next to my bedroom, well though out👏🏻
