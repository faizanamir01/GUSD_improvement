@Nevi_Barrientes @olivialyonss I’m not talking about other alternatives which by the way when H.R.T. doesn’t work, you have to vaccinate afterwards, but I’m talking purely about rights.

@Nevi_Barrientes @olivialyonss If you’re informed on the issue, I’d like to ask you a question. You speak of the “right to choice”. Where does the right to liberty trump the right to life? Why should I be at risk of losing my right to life, so someone can have the right to refuse proven vaccines.

@KylerHaynes @twoandahalfsmen Because they weren’t responsible gun owners. Just the fact that the kid who took the gun for a crime is enough warrant for the parents to be punished. Letting your children access your guns is NOT a trait of responsible gun owners. Many states will punish parents, including Texas

@blake132berdine @olgrcich And we don’t want to ban all guns, that’s not what this is about. It’s just about making it harder for criminals to get their guns in the first place. It’s our job to make sure the world is a safer, better place, and weak gun law states are where we start.
@blake132berdine @olgrcich How does going into a state (Indiana) with minimal gun laws, buying a gun, and taking it across state lines sound illegal? It’s completely legal, it’s just wrong.

@jaredgeng54 @marissofiaaa I’d like to see you participate in any sort of civic activism Jared if you’re so passionate.
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge You’re right, and no one wants to take that from you
@jaredgeng54 @twoandahalfsmen You may not speak to me with that type of vulgarity Jared, because I have simple morals of, well I don’t know, not being RACIST against African Americans like you!
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge You are ignorant.
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge UNLIMITED HOGS!!!
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge Since I was born to the right of free speech.
@jaredgeng54 @twoandahalfsmen You know EXACTLY what you meant behind those words you racist.
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge When was the last time you had 90 intruders in your house Jared? Have you ever even had an intruder in your house? Fear makes us act irrationally, and holding guns over the lives of Americans is irrational. YOU are irrational.
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge Yee-fricken-haw Jared. If your family members need to shoot off 90 rounds of ammunition in 1 minute with a 30 round magazine, then I’m sorry for them. Must be a lot of dogs.
@jaredgeng54 @twoandahalfsmen What you’re reffering to as this “hood” or “ghetto” are completely racist terms, placing the blame somewhere else, and distracting from the true problems.
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge You can’t even spell correctly, let alone be trusted around killing machines...
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge If by AR-15 you mean human designed, high capacity, efficient killing machine, to be used to hunt school children, then sure Jared, you should have an AR-15.

@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge You’re right. You should be able to own a gun, there’s nothing wrong with that. What is wrong, Jared, are these high powered assault rifles in the hands of the public, that was designed for one thing. Killing as many people, quickly and efficiently, for war. To own that is WRONG.
@jaredgeng54 @elle_hodge In that case, you can continue to push your guns over the lives of CHILDREN.
@elle_hodge @jaredgeng54 Looks like you’ve got some common sense yourself elle! That seems very rare these days.
@olgrcich Lemme get the link to this!
@jaredgeng54 We need to ban assault style weapons, ban high capacity magazines and silencers, ban bump stocks, allow universal background checks, eliminate gun reciprocity, increase mental health support, keep from domestic abusers, allow CDC research of gun violence. It’s just common sense.
@jaredgeng54 Even if it’s possible to get a gun illegally, it’s our job to make it a hell of a lot harder. It’s our job to deter future massacres. It’s our job to make the change.
@jaredgeng54 I’m glad that you know that gun control wouldn’t have worked! You’d be pleased to tell that to the 13 people that died during columbine and the 187,000 students effected by gun violence since then as well as their families. Tell them that their children aren’t worth your guns.

@therealmontes00 I believe that school shootings are just a segment of the issue plaguing our nation which is gun violence. And you’re right I’m glad we had this “debate” so hopefully we educate someone. I suggest people take a look at organizations such as ‘Cease Fire’ for more information.
@therealmontes00 You say that that’s not the solution, then what is? If education and reform is not the solution, what is?
@therealmontes00 What you’re missing is it’s not just school shooters. School shootings are just one part of gun violence in America. We need reform now, to prevent gun violence. It’s students, it’s gangs, it’s children, it’s mentally ill people, it’s criminals, and it’s the problem plaguing us.
@therealmontes00 The difference is I just cannot stand quietly by while thousands die at the barrel of a gun. We need to do something, and compliance with gun violence is not that.
@therealmontes00 With that type of mentality nothing would get done. The solution is action, wether it be passing laws, more background checks, or just education. Even by this discussion we have had, it’s some sort of action because hopefully through this someone will become educated on the issue
@therealmontes00 So are we supposed to stand idle by? You say we don’t make gun laws more strict, but you say that school shootings are “disgusting”. If you want to do something, but you don’t want to pass laws to prevent deaths, then what’s the solution? You’re standing in compliance with terror
@therealmontes00 This country’s gun laws are too loose, and the consequences are shown every single day in America, and every 60 hours on school campuses.
@therealmontes00 The gun show loop hole isn’t fixed? The senate shot that down in December! Private sellers at a gun show don’t need any sort of background checks, or even an online gun seller! Anyone can obtain a gun without the knowledge of even their name.
@therealmontes00 One thing we could do is pass REAL federal background checks. The next is ban semi automatic weapons used in mass shootings. School shootings don’t take place with hunting rifles, it’s with military grade weapons they obtain from their parents closet that their dad got at a show.
@therealmontes00 You’re mistaken. According to everytown, where this statistic was gathered by ABC, CNN, NBC, and the Huffington Post, a school shooting is defined as any time a firearm is discharged in a school or on campus. Not just “finding a bullet”, but actually firing the gun near students.
oday, is sadly routine for our nation. Tomorrow, there will be another shooting. There will be another school shooting within the week. There will be another mass shooting this month. It’s too late for many, and the rest of America cannot wait longer. We need action now.
d against the most simple, blanket federal background checks. It’s not a time for “prayer”, or “grievances”, and “thoughts”, it’s a time for action. It is the time and it has been the time for years for gun control, and that is something as a nation we need to get accomplished. T
There’s been a school shooting every 60 hours in our nation. It’s not just school shooting though, it’s the toddler getting into their parents closet, the night club shootings, the gang violence, the senseless murders of thousands. Despite this bloodshed, 23 current senators vote
@therealmontes00 oh okay, so since no one died, it’s okay. Any gun on a school campus is terrifying and those kids deserve recognition for their traumatic experience.
