@elisabeth You stupid jackass.  I am disgusted I tried to communicate with you about my efforts.  Kiss my ass. You are a god damn disgrace to the legal field
@elisabeth And yeah they ‘see’ color.  My kid called black People ‘brown people’ until I explained the correct words as I understood them at the time/. However you can still take your supercilious judgemental BULLSHIT and go.fuck.yourself
@elisabeth Yes.  When they become aware we teach them respectful language and basic history of how everyone got here in Sc, the unvarnished truth. Is what I did.  I’m sorry I didn’t raise my white kid to your standard.  Please do go fuck your self , again.
@elisabeth Fuck all y’all.  My kid is perfectly not racist.  I did that.  You can thank me later
@elisabeth Um.  Fuck you?  You have no idea how we raise kids down here
@elisabeth Btw you are so full of shit.  I cannot and would not raise my bright white kid to be ‘proud’ of her whiteness.  Many white parents consciously try to even out to make a level playing field at the young ages so they have a solid foundation in human interaction without race leading
@elisabeth Yeah ok whatever.  We do the best we can.  Call it whatever but these kids (where I live) are in integrated daycares from infancy and when she got words she learned identifiers that were currentS. You raise your kids how you want and I will raise aware white kids how I do
@neeratanden @PrincessBravato 😂😂😂😂😂😂
@elisabeth But it’s not in small children they mostly don’t fad.  It’s fourth -fifth grade where they start to figure it all out and learn to appreciate differences in race and experience.  If they are carefully taught
@elisabeth I’m on the fence.  When they are little they truly don’t care.   As they get older and learn ‘words’ that are accepted descriptors for other races!l( which obviously requires educated parenting). They start to learn respect for different ethnic backgrounds 1/
