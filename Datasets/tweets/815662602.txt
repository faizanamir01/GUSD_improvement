FACT:  In 2018, over 17,000 adults arrested at the border had prior criminal records. This included over 6,000 gang members, a major number of those members were from MS-13.		#FundTheWallNow #BuildTheWall
FACT:  In four Customs and Border Protection sectors where physical barriers have been expanded -- El Paso, Yuma, Tucson, and San Diego -- illegal traffic has dropped by at least 90%.
FACT:  The abuse of our weak asylum laws has rapidly increased the backlog of our immigration courts. In fiscal year 2018, these courts had a backlog of more than 786,000 pending cases.	#FundTheWallNow #BuildTheWall
FACT:  America’s weak asylum laws allow illegal immigrants with baseless claims to come and stay in the United States while awaiting legal proceedings. Since 2010, these claims have increased by 1,700%. #FundTheWallNow #BuildTheWall
FACT:  @SpeakerPelosi and her hyper-liberal Congressional colleagues just passed a bill to give $54 BILLION to foreign governments,but Democrats won’t allow just $5 billion to secure our borders and protect American citizens.
FACT: Democrats would rather risk safety of hard-working Americans than work with @POTUS to secure our nation’s borders. But in 2013, all 54 Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer, voted to pass legislation that provided $46 billion to build a physical barrier on the border.
FACT: In 2018, over 17,000 adults arrested at the border had prior criminal records. This included over 6,000 gang members, a major number of those members were from MS-13.
FACT: In fiscal year 2018, U.S. Border Patrol seized or helped seize 282,000 pounds of cocaine,248,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 6,500 pounds of heroin, and 2,400 pounds of fentanyl.
