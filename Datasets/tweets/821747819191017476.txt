@VC606 The barn rat is quietly doing his thing. He’ll be top 25 before you know it.
@TrackingPhil Right now it’s looking like Casey and Cantlay might pass Mickelson.
@VC606 @joostluiten Is there a live OWGR anywhere?
@TrackingPhil https://t.co/1kOEZDEl7p
@TrackingPhil After the masters the schedule is pretty clear. Wells Fargo, PGA, and Memorial.
@TrackingPhil Well he’s not playing two tournaments in a row before the masters. Assuming he doesn’t play Bay Hill, he might go players and Valero. Or just players. Or just match play 😂
@TrackingPhil At least in the past 3 years
@TrackingPhil True but he’s had more success in Austin than he’s had at Sawgrass. He also might play at Valero which is either before or after Augusta
@TrackingPhil Well he’s for sure playing match play. 💯
@TrackingPhil I’d like to see him at Bay Hill but I’ll go Sawgrass

@TrackingPhil Rose long grass. The golfing gods are teasing us.
@TrackingPhil Hold your horses. There’s a little bit of drama.
@TrackingPhil Exactly because otherwise, Rose will layup and Rahm and Scott will go for it but with no real pressure. Don’t forget about Gooch though. He’s 3 back and certainly within striking distance to post something.
@TrackingPhil I don’t want to wish any bad luck on Rosey but I also don’t like runaway victories. I like drama, especially this week with the finishing hole.

@TrackingPhil Looked like he struck it cleanly, just the ball is going to get airborne more out of the first cut.
@TrackingPhil Poor decision in my opinion
@GCTigerTracker We appreciate your enthusiasm TT

@TrackingPhil @finau_tony @RickieLegion I’ll tell you one thing, Spieth can’t afford to not play tournaments that he usually plays in.
@TrackingPhil @finau_tony @RickieLegion Sure but a lot of other really big names missing.
@Rodcox84 I like to say it’s been consistently inconsistent 😂 showing one idea for 3 runs and then switching to another idea for 3 runs and then something else.
@NWSMemphis Dusting in Martin.
@Rodcox84 Certainly doesn’t look as impressive for NW Tennessee.
@WBBJ7TomMeiners light snow in Martin with a dusting on the grass.
@TrackingPhil Can’t wait.
@TrackingPhil If Phil happened to get a hole-in-one, there would be an earthquake in Arizona.
@TrackingPhil Agreed. Also I’m not sure what, if any, Majors DL3 is qualified for but I can certainly see him catching fire.
@TrackingPhil Any older players you think have a chance at the majors. (Besides Phil because we all know the answer to that 😉) Say Couples at Augusta or Harrington at the Open.
@TrackingPhil Oh god. Spieth is gonna blow up and shoot a 78 or something.
@TrackingPhil @GCTigerTracker Now do that for Phil more often
@GregThornerGolf I’ve always played with the pin in. Just habit. The knee high drop is what’s going to trip me up.

@TrackingPhil I don’t know how the USGA sets up Pebble for the US Open. If I knew that than I would be able to decide between the Masters or Us Open.
@TrackingPhil @GOLF_com I don’t even think that Tiger would need to break Jack’s record. I think if he passes Snead and wins 2 more majors than that might do it for some people.
Light rain and gusty winds in Martin. @WBBJ7TomMeiners
@Rodcox84 Looks rather interesting for northwest Tennessee. Depends on if it starts as rain and how long it stays as rain.
@Rodcox84 Dare I even check the 00z run?

Incomprehensible. That’s the only way to describe the increasing gap between TN MBB and WBB. https://t.co/recvLzyz3Z
@TrackingPhil Hard to say; there’s so many courses that he loves to play at. Out of Pebble (twice 😉), WMO, Mexico, Augusta, and Southwind, I’d go with a title defense at Mexico.
@Momeaux Bad call I think even though the Hawkeye clearly proved her wrong.
@shanemilner @johndaniels155 @VC606 Oh ok. Didn’t know that.
Hmmm GBO https://t.co/IA4HGRqiWP

@johndaniels155 @VC606 Ok “BAD” I don’t get. I’ll agree with you there.
@johndaniels155 @VC606 If you’re an avid golf fan, than it shouldn’t matter because you should already know who he’s talking about. 🤦🏼‍♂️
@TrackingPhil It took me a while to get over the duel at troon. That remains the most heartbroken that I’ve ever been watching Phil.
@AlexJamesPerko @TrackingPhil I’m with you. I think I title defense at Mexico is in order. That course suits him well.
@TrackingPhil That’s big. Gives him a cushion between him and the 50th spot.

@TrackingPhil Hadwin has a long birdie putt on the par 5. Good chance of him making par.
@TrackingPhil He’s a long way down there though
@TrackingPhil Par 5 next. Let’s go
@TrackingPhil He’s still long enough to go with less than driver.
@TrackingPhil And not a big one at that

@TrackingPhil All of these guys are just coming out of the woodwork.

@WilhiteWx @JAJteach It’s certainly a complex setup. Especially for where I’m at in Northwest Tennessee. I look to the west (Arkansas) look to the east (NC) and think oh what could’ve been. Still though, there’s time to hopefully get some last minute shifts in the models, however that time is short.
@DickieDoo79 @sashatalebi @ChuckGrassley Sure thing 🙄
@sashatalebi @ChuckGrassley Maybe you can test it out for him. If you like it enough, than you can stay there.
@CodyBaileyWNKY Models are still having a difficult time with when the changeover will happen. Latest run of the NAM shows a quicker changeover, at least for where I’m at in northwest Tennessee.
@StormTrackBrian I’d assume northern Tennessee, especially northwest Tennessee has the best chance for wintry weather.

@SpencerKarter @NWSSPC Why wouldn’t I? They are just trying to keep people safe, but it’s real hard to their job when idiots like you blame them for everything.
Significant severe weather is likely across the Deep South and southeast. The greatest risk will be the tan enhanced risk, but keep in mind, storms don’t know where these lines are so everyone needs to pay attention to the weather. Nocturnal (maybe strong) tornadoes are possible. https://t.co/i54Xrxh3iE
Latest run of the GFS continues to show a deep, negatively-tilted upper level trough northwest of St. Louis with a trailing cold front. Significant wind shear (turning of the wind with height) and strong instability could lead to a rather robust November severe weather day. https://t.co/HtCgLk5Lrn
@Rodcox84 @NWSSPC Yes it certainly is never a good thing to see this type of setup when we are actually relatively close to the event for forecasting purposes. It’s not like we’re a week out.
It would be amazing if people could stop blaming the NWS offices and @NWSSPC for ‘spreading negative forecasts.’ Obviously no one wants severe weather on Election Day, but please don’t blame meteorologists for it.
@SpencerKarter @NWSSPC Yeah thanks a lot SPC for trying to warn people about severe weather. 🙄

@Rodcox84 @G8RMET Yes. This system is currently near Alaska.
@G8RMET @Rodcox84 However I’m also seeing that the GFSis trending dryer. They could meet in the middle and put down maybe an inch or two
@spann Could the argument be made that the Euro is trending wetter? Wasn’t it, at one point, bone dry?
@StormTrackBrian Slower and dryer https://t.co/sxblMpQJIE

@StormTrackBrian Has there ever been this much disagreement between the global models before? I can’t believe how different the two really are.

The two global are disagreeing like an old married couple. The GFS says yes to snow on New Year’s Eve. The European (ECMWF) says no. It is completely dry. The European does have a better track record for forecasting winter events.  GFS on the left, Euro on the right. https://t.co/9pXNz4KIkh

Latest run of the GFS suggests snow for parts of the southeast next Sunday. Uncertainty abounds however, it’s something that needs to be monitored. To soon to talk about amounts but this run suggests 2-4 inches. Take this with mounds of salt. https://t.co/5We97bwyHq
Global models are indicating that the much of the southeast should be warm enough for just rain. However, a cold air damming situation could unfold for north Georgia and the Carolinas. So an ice storm could be in the works to or east. But I’m closely watching next wknd. https://t.co/g3eztGNuH6

5 days until we see the return of the 🐐. Tiger Woods returning to competitive golf is great but for all intents and purposes, this will be his last return. Fusion surgery is the last option. If this comeback isn’t successful, then don’t expect Tiger to play golf ever again.

@spann isn't just a joy to forecast severe weather in the southeast When one model says one thing and another model says something different

@NWSMemphis I know it's a little early but what about the severe for Sunday-Monday?
@NWSMorristown is the tornado threat for Cleveland low? It appears that the storms will form into a line when they reach us.
@NWSMemphis could the higher severe weather probs be shifted over parts of eastern Tennessee
@spann it seems like the bad severe weather risks are bypassing the southeast. Not saying that slight risks shouldn't be taking seriously.

@TheMJTake what's going on with hightower. At one point the Titans were front runners. You'd think that Tennessee would be perfect for him.
@NWSMorristown trace in south Cleveland. Measured 8:42am. Back roads are fine
@TheMJTake how come were not signing a damn corner back. All of them are going elsewhere
@NWSMorristown winter weather?
@StormTrack9Dave @newschannelnine welcome to Tennessee
RT @CBCEMA: In conjunction with Severe Weather Week all City &amp; County Schools will conduct a Tornado DRILL today between 9am &amp; 10am.
@spann There's so many different weather outlets all of which are reliable that use  terminology like significant severe weather outbreak
@NWSMorristown does the upcoming severe weather event have the characteristics of a derecho?
@spann does the upcoming severe weather event have the characteristics of a derecho. Also I enjoyed weather brains last night.
@NWSMorristown do you think a moderate risk is appropriate? The fact that we were an enhanced risk of day 4 is pretty significant.
@spann let's hope it stays an enhanced risk. I don't want anything above that
Calling the game #bearettesvsladycavs
@spann Ok thanks. I'll have to start watching your videos
@spann Do you think an enhanced risk will be issued for somebody? If not why?
@finebaum UT is finally going to win the east... hopefully
@NWSMorristown what are the chances of severe weather for the weekend. @NWSBirmingham already has an elevated risk for central AL.
