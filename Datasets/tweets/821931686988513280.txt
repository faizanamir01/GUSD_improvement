@ValentinGosu If you're afraid that you could emotionally hurt someone with your "truth" then by all means, keep it concealed. Doesn't mean that you have to lie out of guilt. Just shut up and avoid discourse or engage and comfort them with your words.
@washingtonpost I can't speak for most Americans, but growing up in the "hood" and later moving to a middle-class subdivision, you learn to appreciate certain amenities. You don't need much to survive, but to thrive, it takes a functioning community that cares about you and your wellbeing.
@Biancadelarosa8 Why are people offended by sexual orientation? If people want to go out of their way to do something you don't agree with don't criticize their behavior... Support their decision to change the course of human history. Eventually, anti-gays are going to face extinction. #FACTS

@JosephNSanberg Financially literacy should be inculcated at an early age. Incorporate it into the K-12 curriculum and watch how many students adopt fiscally responsible habits, or do we need a bottomless lower-class population for the jobs we're overqualified for?
