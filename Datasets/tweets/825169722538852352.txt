@Mr_Incredible66 @brooklynmarie @AClaudeCase @andizeisler You know how we have the Silent Generation? They ought to rename Generation X as the Forgotten Generation.
@realDonaldTrump 🙄🙄🙄🙄
@Mr_Incredible66 @brooklynmarie @AClaudeCase @andizeisler The ‘Tweeners, from 1964-1967, and the Xennials, from 1977-1981. The ‘Tweeners share characteristics of both Boomers and Gen-X, and Xennials share characteristics of both Gen-X and the Millennials. Neither group really fits very well with any of those three generations.

@AnotherRogueAcc @WNYGeek81 @lady_cordir @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter I find it interesting that this person hasn’t responded to anything I’ve said since.
@WNYGeek81 @repulsive_cut @lady_cordir @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter Citation, please.
@WNYGeek81 @lady_cordir @JennnnChura @dialmformolly @repulsive_cut @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter And this has what to do with the topic at hand?
@WNYGeek81 False.
@WNYGeek81 So just for clarification, “regular basis” means this happens regularly all over the country. Not that one sick and twisted “doctor” did it multiple times.  		So prove it. Go ahead.
@WNYGeek81 You REALLY didn’t understand what I said. When I said to give me evidence that this happens regularly, I wasn’t talking about the sick case that is Kermit Gosnell. I meant prove that what he did happens as a matter of course in hospitals and clinics. https://t.co/Q6mUYjEgo9
@WNYGeek81 @DrJenGunter Why wouldn’t she? Standard practice is to perform a pre-term delivery when the baby is viable, and then provide care and monitoring in NICU. If there’s a good chance the baby will die no matter what, the options are discussed with the parents. Nobody’s murdering babies. NOBODY.
@WNYGeek81 @lady_cordir @KatieDid927 @DrJenGunter Yeah, yeah, we all know about Kermit Gosnell. He was sick and disgusting. Point me to a reputable paper showing that Gosnell’s practices happen on a regular basis and maybe you’ll have a leg to stand on.
@WNYGeek81 @DrJenGunter Seeing as how it’s true, why wouldn’t she want to stick by it?
@WalshFreedom Why don’t rich people just do that and be done with it instead of hoarding their millions and billions and crying about taxes they don’t pay and the gall of their workers to demand a living wage?
@WalshFreedom The baby’s quality of live must also be protected. Sometimes that means letting the parents decide NOT to prolong their baby’s suffering and postpone their death.
@SSulli84 @LisaPLDP @WalshFreedom @hannah_gianna No, we’re saying the government shouldn’t have a role here. The decision to try and save the baby’s life or make them comfortable and let them go quietly should be between the doctor and the parents.
@jordanslearned @WalshFreedom And even then they’re not always abortions. If the baby is healthy and it’s only the mother’s life and health in jeopardy, they do a pre-term delivery. Yes, you’re ending the pregnancy early, but the baby is delivered alive and sent to NICU. Nobody kills a healthy pre-term baby.
@01cathy07 @realDonaldTrump @GOP What’s ironic is jagoffs like @WalshFreedom are fine with the government interfering with a woman’s medical care and that of her unborn baby, but scream about government getting between us and our doctors whenever anyone so much as whispers “Medicare for all.”
@valsfunfarm @WalshFreedom Probably not, but I know people who have. Trisomy 13 is devastating and fatal, and the humane thing to do is make the baby as comfortable as possible and let them slip away quietly. Attempts to prolong their life are really just postponing death and prolonging their suffering.
@alt_4nTrade Jesus. You should be arrested amd thrown in jail for this.
@WalshFreedom Do you even CARE why someone would vote no on a bill like this? No? Then you're not pro-life. You're just pro-forced birth. And no, outlawing abortion won't stop this - it'll make it worse. Botched abortions are far more likely when abortion is ILLEGAL than when it's LEGAL.
@WalshFreedom Any medical practitioner that, AFTER TALKING TO THE PARENTS ABOUT THEIR OPTIONS, lets a baby die, does so out of the same ethics and standards that allow us to determine whether to turn the machines off or keep them on for any other person for whom we can make that decision.
@Joyjoysilva @WalshFreedom After 21 weeks...if the mother's life is in danger but the baby is viable...the hospital performs a pre-term delivery. They DO NOT kill the baby. They also DO NOT resuscitate a pre-term child only to kill it if the parents say so. The pro-forced-birth crowd MAKES ME SO ANGRY!!!!
@Joyjoysilva @WalshFreedom You know what's sickening to me? I personally know labor/delivery RNs who have performed pre-term deliveries for the very children that RWNJs claim are killed so long as abortion is legal. That's a lie. NOBODY intentionally kills ANY CHILD...OR ADULT...PERIOD.
@MattLoweDesigns @Bespoken2018 @WalshFreedom And forcing a pair of parents to pay thousands in medical bills for a child that was never, ever going to leave the hospital. A child that was going to need expensive medical care for the rest of his/her life. And so forth. They're SICK. VERY, VERY, FUCKING SICK.
@Bespoken2018 @WalshFreedom Yep, or babies who will spend their entire short lives in excruciating pain...I could name a thousand examples. The bottom line is that people like @WalshFreedom don't value life. They value BIRTH, and...well...I don't know exactly what else they value, but it isn't life.
@WalshFreedom If you TRULY cared, you would never have posted this. So fuck off, you pro-forced birth, misogynistic, greedy sonofabitch.
@WalshFreedom Do you even CARE why someone would vote no on a bill like this? No? Then you're not pro-life. You're just pro-forced birth. And no, outlawing abortion won't stop this - it'll make it worse. Botched abortions are far more likely when abortion is ILLEGAL than when it's LEGAL.

@WalshFreedom .@WalshFreedom, shut up. If you think that anyone refuses to do what's necessary to keep a baby alive, regardless of how it enters this world, you're sadly misinformed.
@tallygal1 Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww *gag*

@AltAthiest Yep. Many come through cargo ports, airports, and mail screening branches. Maybe I should be more clear on this; people seem to think “ports of entry” means the ports at the southern border, particularly when discussing things that enter the country illegally.
@TheRickWilson Except I’m guessing you don’t have the proper authorization for accessing the tarmac, so they’re trying to compensate for that by playing Scooby Doo cartoons at ear-piercing volumes.
Really...what is so hard to understand about this? https://t.co/RmNbfpO5jp
@jdb240 @RepMattGaetz What is so hard to understand about if so many more drugs get seized at ports of entry then it also stands to reason that most of the drugs that get through and into the U.S. ALSO come through ports of entry?
@OldTehanu @RandiSanders17 @altGS_rocks She looks like an alpha. She’s got that I AM THE QUEEN look about her. 😻
@Azrdraco @Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz No, actually because it’s lightweight compared to hard drugs. Hard drugs like meth, fentanyl, cocaine and heroin weigh too much to smuggle profitably between ports of entry.
@JesseGiesbrecht @Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz @USCG But they all somehow know it’s less than or equal to what a wall would stop. 😂😂😂

@NathalieQueen3 @Trumpet1984 @Harlan @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke I did. You moves the goalposts. Sorry if you can’t understand that.
@Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz So take off your shoes and count. 		You ARE aware of the fact that apprehensions and seizures are the standard and accepted method for ESTIMATING what comes into the country? You have a better way to do this? Be my guest.
@NathalieQueen3 @Trumpet1984 @Harlan @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke That’s not what you said, but by all means, keep moving the goalposts.
@Gg26262861 @JesseGiesbrecht @RepMattGaetz @USCG What’s going to be more effective the quickest? Dynamic, proactive measures at the ports of entry or a wall that will take years to build, giving the cartels a chance to adapt before we even have enough built to see if it’ll work?
@Gg26262861 @JesseGiesbrecht @RepMattGaetz @USCG If most drugs come through ports of entry and are caught by the Coast Guard, then why are we wasting time and money and a national emergency on a damned wall instead of addressing the majority of the problem?

@Gg26262861 @JesseGiesbrecht @RepMattGaetz @USCG No, but they do catch and seize a lot of drugs. A wall won’t stop what they catch either.
@Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz Or do you expect me to believe that the Border Patrol is missing far more smugglers despite their growing staffing numbers? The same argument is often made about illegal border crossers - that apprehensions mean shit. They only mean shit to people like you who believe lies.
@Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz The proof is in the difference between the field operations numbers and the Border Patrol’s numbers. Or are you too stupid to figure out simple arithmetic?
@Gg26262861 @RepMattGaetz What it shows is where the bulk of the drugs are, and why a a wall isn’t going to do jack to stop them. But in case you don’t believe that, maybe you’ll believe El Chapo’s people? 		https://t.co/MwS742av2s

@DeadLetterBox Well, if the House passes a resolution to halt this, the Senate is forced to take it up. McConnell has no choice, he can’t just say the Senate isn’t going to take it up. The question then becomes are there enough other Senate Republicans who would vote yes on that resolution?

@cognitiveimagry @angelina_n_ris Yeah, but I can function with the ant thing. I can’t function with a migraine.
@JamesLBruno But that also requires getting big money out of politics entirely. No more mega donors, no more corporate donors. All campaigns funded by individual, private donations capped at an amount that the average American can afford so the rich can no longer have outsized influence.
@JamesLBruno I’d prefer that if it meant everyone agreed on the problems facing us and just disagreed on the best way to solve them. It’s hard to come up with the best solution possible when you’re working only with people who think like you - the entire group has tunnel vision.
@cognitiveimagry @angelina_n_ris Yep...which is why it makes me jittery and restless and feel like ants are crawling around inside me. But as much as I hate feeling that way, it’s still better than the migraine I’ll get if I let it go for too long.
@JamesLBruno Except we have an entire political party that’s terrified of crossing him. That’s what bothers me so much. The GOP is nothing more than a bunch of Trump sycophants. I’m worried that the current work in Congress is an anomaly in this reality, rather than a sign they’re waking up.

@beegeerose @RogueAltGov He’s stupid, but he also only hears what he wants to hear. In this case, he’s so damned focused on getting his wall that I have a feeling he only heard, “$23 billion,” and “wall funding.” He didn’t hear any words before, after or in between, or anything else from Shelby.

@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff But since that’s not even remotely what happened, arguing the technicality is whitewashing history and people need to focus on THAT truth of what Northam said.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff The ONLY way one could make a legit argument for differentiating the indentured Africans from the enslaved Africans enslaved is if the colony had them as indentured servants equal to the European servants for the majority, or all, of their history during the slave era. 😑😑😑
@PeteEarthling Yup! This is a cat that KNOWS it rules the house.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff Then in the 1660s (I think), more slave laws were passed which just made things worse for slaves.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff ...and just a short ten years later the colony passed its first slave laws, and those Africans were turned into slaves.
@SusanSeaside @AngrierWHStaff It has to do with the colony’s original laws. The first indentured servants were from Europe and started coming in like 1605 or 1607 I think. When Africans began arriving in 1619, they were treated as indentured servants too....

@rgh184 @RogueUSMint Yep. And yet, they cling to it more strongly than they do the Gospels.
@RandiSanders17 Most domestic felines got to both North and South America that way, I think. Cats were extremely useful aboard ships because they hunted rodents. Same as how they became domesticated in the first place.

@alt_kellyanne_ @AngrierWHStaff ...but people who want to defend Northam are grabbing onto it so they can feel okay about whitewashing history...again.
@alt_kellyanne_ @AngrierWHStaff People who are quibbling are saying that the first Africans in Virginia were, in fact, indentured servants and not slaves. But that lasted a whole 10 years before they were stripped of what little freedom they had and turned into slaves. The timeline is so short it’s irrelevant..
@AngrierWHStaff Yep. And even if you acknowledge that technicality, Africans in Virginia weren’t indentured servants for very long before the colony stripped them of their freedom entirely and made them slaves. And then kept them in slavery. So let’s not quibble about the technicalities here.

@RogueUSMint Since it was written by man before and during the time of the Roman Empire, it’s easy to see why it makes no mention of either American continent. Nobody knew these continents even existed.
@RogueUSMint Word of God, INSPIRED by God but written by man and put through so many translations that it’s hard to know what the “original” Bible said. That’s another hotly debated topic among evangelicals.
@RogueUSMint It’s a literal interpretation of the Book of Revelation and it’s interesting if you can get past all the preachy parts they put in.
@RogueUSMint Ever hear of the Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins? Both are evangelical and their series starts with the Rapture, takes place during the Tribulation and ends with the Second Coming of Christ. It’s a fictional account of the New Testament’s end times.
@RogueUSMint @Lok52 I don’t blame you. 😂😂😂
@jjames321 @AltSpaceForce1 Gah! Staaaahhhhp!
@RogueUSMint Anyway, I don’t want to get into a theological debate or an argument over whether such support of Israel is right, wrong or just is. This is what I gleaned from the church I attended a million years ago regarding our ongoing, extremely staunch support for Israel.
@RogueUSMint Since Israel is the Holy Land and plays a major role in the Bible (and in the Tribulation/Second Coming), our very powerful evangelical wing is heavily supportive of Israel, to the point where any criticism at all of Israel is so blasphemous that they viscerally react to it.
@RogueUSMint The Middle East does, though, especially Israel, and Israel figures prominently in the Bible. Israel is the Holy Land. It’s where Christ will appear to render final judgment on the Earth after the Tribulation (end times, apocalypse, whatever you want to call it).
@RogueUSMint The thing is, Biblically, North America has no role in the End Times at all. We don’t appear anywhere in the Bible, and I think that scares evangelicals to death (at least, the church I once went to seemed scared to death of that).
@RogueUSMint Evangelical Christians seem desperate for the End Times to come, because they so want Jesus Christ to sweep them all up to Heaven and watch from on high as God reigns judgment after judgment on all the sinners he left behind here on Earth.

@joncoopertweets @AshaRangappa_ Personally, I’m much more likely to forgive someone for blackface in 1990 who takes full responsibility for their actions and the resulting pain and harm, and who has learned and grown since then, than I am for someone who did it in 1960 and is trying to defend or excuse it.
@joncoopertweets As an example, here’s how @MarkHerringVA responded to being called out for dressing in blackface: 		https://t.co/FZo73qSWC3
@joncoopertweets .@AshaRangappa_  had a good thread about this, too, which goes into more depth than mine does. She mentions the timeline but when you consider the more important questions, how long ago this was is far less relevant than it seems. Here’s her thread: 		https://t.co/gf3PIHYYoj
@joncoopertweets 3) This is possibly the most important item. In the case of blackface, what does the black community see from this person now? Are they willing to forgive? Do they feel this person has been making a genuine effort to be an ally since that incident? What do they think?
@joncoopertweets 2) Does their record since then indicate they’ve actually learned about racism and why things like blackface are unacceptable? Can they show they understand much more now than then? Or does their history since look more like they’re repentant now only because they’ve been caught?
@joncoopertweets 1) When they were called out, did they take responsibility for it? Did they acknowledge the harm their behavior caused? Do they know it was unacceptable even then?		Or are they trying to gloss over it, excuse it or defend it, including using the timeline? Is their story changing?
@joncoopertweets This isn’t as simple as how long it’s been. I will never excuse blackface any more than I will excuse rape. There are, IMO, three things to look at: 		1) How they respond to being called out for it		2) What they’ve done since that time		3) How the community they harmed feels

@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi (And by the way, it can be dangerous for a woman to demand that a man wear a condom, or she’s not having sex with him.)
@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi Women are told to make him wear a condom, to be sure they’re taking their BC correctly, and above all, to avoid sex altogether if they don’t want to RISK pregnancy, because pregnancy is the ultimate punishment for a woman having sex. What about the man that impregnates her?
@MtfoxX3 @FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi I’m pretty sure that’s what happened, yes.
@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi I mean, sure, we talk about deadbeat dads and look down on them, but society does not police men for having sex no matter how irresponsible he is about it. His irresponsibility is transferred to the women he has sex with, and they’re held responsible for it.
@FeedMyLizard @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi Women don’t get pregnant by crawling on top of themselves. It literally takes a man for that, and unless she’s artificially inseminated, he must be present for her to become pregnant. But men can have as much sex as they want and nobody polices them for it.
@RedDrag36308249 @R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi Maybe we should start by requiring comprehensive, age-appropriate and medically-accurate sex-ed in schools.
@GeorgiaBeattie3 @OceanGirl124 @SlenderSherbet I would assume so, but head pressing is such an alarming behavior that I freak whenever I see anything that looks like it.

@R_M_Huffman @AOC @KamalaHarris @HillaryClinton @SenWarren @SenGillibrand @TeamPelosi Women can get pregnant about once per month and produce one child AT MOST every nine months, while men can impregnate dozens of women each month, so of course the burden is on women to avoid pregnancy.

@AZ_TNO @JesseGiesbrecht @poldiscourse17 @AltNatSecAgency Yes I do. Now answer it yourself. Do you?
@JesseGiesbrecht @AZ_TNO @poldiscourse17 @AltNatSecAgency My guess is no because such a tax rate punishes rich people for being virtuous and hardworking enough to become rich. You know, those people who employ the rest of us simply out of the goodness of their hearts so we can also have food and roofs over our heads?

@RobinByrd3 And what about all the fearmongering over universal healthcare and “Do YOU want the gov’t between you and your doctor?” Restricting abortion, especially late-term abortion (which is virtually always medically necessary) is the ultimate in putting gov’t between doctor and patient.

@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling You know that what’s said about that video is true how?
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Exactly. They surrendered, request asylum, and until an immigration court decides their case they are not in the country illegally.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Nope. The law says what it says. Do I need to send it to you again?
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling No, I’m telling you what the law is and how it makes your videos meaningless. Nowhere have I said how I feel about it. Don’t put words in my mouth.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling “Whether or not at a designated port of arrival” and “irrespective of such alien’s status.” How they crossed the border is irrelevant once they request asylum.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling I will not tell you where I live. But the truth is the whole “this is my city” bullshit is just that since you know nothing about me. 		The law is the law. Don’t like it? Work to change it.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling How do you know that’s not my city as well? You don’t know where I live, or where I’ve lived.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Asylum-seekers aren’t illegal and if they’re being dropped off by DHS that should have been your first clue.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling I’m just telling you what the law is. I can’t help it if you neither understand nor like it.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Read the law. https://t.co/hxbcYIYYm2
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling And no, asylum law specifically states “whether or not at a designated port of arrival” and “irrespective of such alien’s status.” Once they request asylum they do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the country. https://t.co/hxbcYIYYm2 https://t.co/iG0gWJhCM2
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling If they came in on DHS buses they didn’t cross the border illegally. They came to a port of entry and requested asylum.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Asylum-seekers. Not “illegals.” Big difference.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Asylum-seekers do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the United States until their case is decided by an immigration court. That’s the truth, so now your videos are even more meaningless.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling “Boom.” Give me a break. Asylum-seekers aren’t illegal.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling So asylum-seekers. They aren’t illegal.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling I am serious, yes I did watch, and that complex houses more than just a church. Nowhere in the video does anyone put forth anything other than assumptions about what they’re doing there. So the videos are meaningless.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Because there’s no context.
@CuomoCPT_515 I’m not sure what you’re getting at.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling Ohhhhhhh...are these asylum seekers? That complex has federal offices in it. If they’re asylum-seekers they aren’t illegal. 		Again, without proof or even context, these videos are meaningless.
@shalynnchavez @PeteEarthling You haven’t answered how you know who these busloads of people are. Without that proof, your videos are meaningless.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump He laid out nothing of the sort. Just a vague promise to bring down costs, which many of your leaders in Congress don’t support.
@U2Ronnie Yup.
“We will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.” Not while cutting foreign aid we can’t.
@Imalloutofideas “InDUStrees.” Yeah.
@JesseGiesbrecht @AZ_TNO @poldiscourse17 @AltNatSecAgency No...remember he’s a free-thinker and we’re just brainwashed leftists. He doesn’t understand that facts tend to go against what he wants to think.
“Lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.” I’d like to see something from anyone on that side of the aisle that will actually do that. Trump sounds like he wants universal healthcare but we all know that’s not true.
@JesseGiesbrecht @AZ_TNO @poldiscourse17 @AltNatSecAgency And I’m live-tweeting a lot of it, so.
@JesseGiesbrecht @AZ_TNO @poldiscourse17 @AltNatSecAgency Your opinion is just that. But you are not “fair and balanced” no matter how much you’ve deluded yourself into thinking you are.

@PeteEarthling Good lord.
There it is. The wall. He’s plugging the wall as though things are the same now as they were 13 years ago, and reiterating his promise to get it built. “See-through steel barrier.” It will “be deployed” where border agents say, and “when walls go up, illegal crossings go...down.”
@PeteEarthling Yeah, just like the busloads of people who went to NH from Massachusetts to vote illegally in 2016.
Wonder if he’ll say anything about the REAL terror threat: extreme right-wing white men.
“Fentanol.” LMAO!!!! It’s “fentanyl” jackass. 		And no, American citizens join and expand MS-13. They don’t “mostly come through” the southern border, you lying fuckweasel.
Here comes the pitch for the wall. And the lies that go with it.
“Defend our very dangerous southern border out of love” for your fellow American, and end illegal immigration so that the country will stop being divided and working class citizens can have better lives. Hospitals “so crowded you can’t get in...” oh please. Where is this???
Caravans now. Talking about ordering troops and calling the caravans an onslaught, and he says the southern border is “lawless.” Fuck of, you fucking fuckwit.
Oh god I hate when he talks about anything to do with immigration. He wants to commit to putting the cartels and traffickers out of business? What an ass.

We have a racist president whose example has made the racists feel okay about being openly racist. Then we get into, “Well you gave that person a pass, why not this person? Or me?” and “How long ago does it have to be before it’s okay?” So no. No pass. Not to Northam, or anyone.
I see people saying this happened decades ago. Why should he be punished now? Because we can’t send the message that being a racist is okay or was ever okay. Dismissing this as, “Oh, well, it happened forever ago, give him a break,” we give tacit approval for racism today.

@oilfieldtraitor It depends on the job. More common jobs requiring fewer skills and less training tend to pay more than their private sector counterparts. But jobs that require highly-specialized skills and extensive training tend to pay less than their private sector counterparts.

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Seeing as how there is a correlation there, yes, I think cutting taxes too much corresponds to a decrease in GDP because there’s less incentive to reinvest money into your own business. There’s no incentive to take risks with innovation.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Our top marginal tax rate was 94% coming out of WWII, but averaged 90% both before and after the war, up until Lyndon Johnson, who cut it to 77%, and then Nixon cut it again to 70%. What was our economy doing for most of this?
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It was under 70%. Reagan cut it to 28%, blew a hole in the federal budget, and brought on a recession in which part of the solution was raising some of the taxes he had cut. 		And no, if you think Reaganomics was a success then I have a beautiful bridge to sell you.

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You don’t know how old I am. And there’s no way you can know what Reagan did if you love him so much. He did a lot of stuff that the Republicans decry as “radical left” today. History is your friend, son.

@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Because “in absentia” means the case was decided without the applicant/defendant present.

@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Actually it does...there’s a drop-down near the bottom for drug seizures. 		And that’s a source *I* gave him and suddenly he’s all “the seizures mean you’re wrong,” while earlier he was claiming that those same statistics don’t prove anything. How disingenuous can someone get?
@JesseGiesbrecht @ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Correct, yes. The number was higher under Obama...can’t imagine why.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Two problems: 1) Our asylum law requires an applicant to be within our physical land borders to request asylum. 2) We can’t just rewrite the law to require asylum seekers to apply from their own nations. We need inter-governmental cooperation with those countries.
@ReaganTrump1 @JesseGiesbrecht @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Fix the system. Given how the situation has changed over the last 15 years, a wall is no longer a cost-effective part of any immigration plan. That’s what I’m against - wasting money on a wall that could be better used in real immigration reform and border security.
@ReaganTrump1 False. If the Republicans didn’t want cheap labor, they wouldn’t have changed the tax code under Reagan to incentivize offshoring. Democrats want a living wage. It’s Republicans who whine about wages getting too high for business here.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I suppose you believe that we should bring back the 18th Amendment as well, since everyone is drunk all the time...oh wait.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump False. Legalizing marijuana has been shown to reduce crime along the border states and put a dent in the cartels’ drug market here. Since marijuana is by far the drug most often seized, legalizing it would eliminate one of their biggest markets here.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump False. I’m not conflating a damned thing. I’m proving I know how to read and interpret statistics, whereas you’re flailing around for reasons to discredit the data because it doesn’t support your narrative.

@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Almost entirely marijuana that we could end very easily just by legalizing it nationwide. The hard drugs are too heavy to smuggle in profitable quantities outside of ports of entry. That’s why they go to the ports of entry, the shipping ports and the mail branches.
Good. https://t.co/AvvsuYn5y7
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump And you tell me what that has to do with the wall when you just contradicted your own talking point on that.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump As Nina said, they bring them in that way because it’s their greatest chance of success. And she correctly pointed out that they come in through ALL ports of entry, not just the ones at the southern border.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So you think Trump’s administration is inflating or otherwise manipulating statistics? Why would they? If there’s a border crisis, why would they manipulate statistics to show otherwise?
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Answer my question. Where are you getting the 22+ million? What’s your source? Because the commonly known and understood number is between 11 and 12 million. So give me your source.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump How do you not know any of this? A lot of this is common understanding of how things work.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It’s also called the medical examination that always occurs when someone dies of a drug overdose.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It’s called autopsies.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Where are you getting the 22 million? You keep beating that number like it’s written in stone and I have yet to find a source that cites that number as a fact.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Not as many as you are. At least the data supports my extrapolations. You don’t like the fact that the data doesn’t say what you want, so you claim it’s meaningless.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Um. You do know the Census bureau works on population studies outside of the big decennial censes, right? They don’t just come out of the woodwork once every ten years to do the big census.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You don’t know how statistics work, do you?
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It’s not 22 million and a wall isn’t going to address enough of the problem to be worth the billions you want to spend.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Because your source, that I actually looked at, literally says they didn’t. It LITERALLY says it.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump He didn’t. Neither did the Flores decision and George W. and Obama had a policy of keeping children with their parents whenever and wherever possible, in accordance with the Flores decision.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don’t think she has and I haven’t either.

@ninahawk_nani @ReaganTrump1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump One other thing: The hard drugs mostly come in through legal ports of entry. The only drug that’s smuggled in en masse between ports of entry is pot.

@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Not really when you look at the whole picture.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Declines in apprehensions at the border indicate declines in the number of people trying to cross it illegally. Since the number of officers at ports of entry and in the Border Patrol have significantly increased over the same time, you can extrapolate a decline in crossings.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, but they can estimate and they do using census data on foreign born people in the U.S., along with the census counts on native-born Americans and our total population. The discrepancy is the estimate of our undocumented population.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You cited all overdose deaths and gave me a link where a report breaks it down. The cartels didn’t cause anywhere CLOSE to 73,0000 overdose deaths. Also, you failed to specify overdoses. And you have the gall to accuse US of mischaracterization? DUDE. https://t.co/pg25qhH0h9
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump When you use the word “apprehensions” to describe your numbers, and the government uses apprehensions to describe the situation (which they do), then no, it’s not a mischaracterization.
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Answer my question. If all we have is apprehension rates, WHICH SHE LITERALLY STATED, then how do you know the number getting through is such a problem? Especially considering that the majority are visa overstays and an even larger majority have been here for years, even decades?
@ReaganTrump1 @ninahawk_nani @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I know the answers already and I know you’re out of your gourd with these numbers. But I want to see where you’re getting them or if you’re pulling them out your ass like I’m prtty sure you are.

@ReaganTrump1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump It’s about half that and the majority come in legally on visas and then just never leave.

@Wesihcfan @AriFleischer CEO salaries are often in excess of $1 million per year. Wall Street execs, too.

@RogerTPeterson2 And they weren't guerrila fighters. That's another myth.
@RogerTPeterson2 They were created by a group of Salvadoran refugees in Los Angeles, and the MS13 groups here are not controlled by El Salvador. They aren't even the biggest and worst gang threat in the U.S. There's no way to know if a wall would have stopped those people from coming in.
Why term limits are a bad idea for the legislative branch: https://t.co/I4VyGd1PaJ
@mitchellvii MS13 is a homegrown gang. They probably would have grown and evolved the same way. As for rape and murder? You aren’t serious. A wall wouldn’t have, and will not, make a difference since thr vast, VAST majority of those crimes are committed are by U.S. citizens.
@mitchellvii The same. Traffickers and the cartels aren’t stupid. They’re very good at adapting to what we do to try and stop them. They’d have long since rendered the wall useless. As for undocumented immigrants, the majority today are visa overstays. We’d just have more visa overstays.
@joncoopertweets Trump Jr. I’d love to see what Trump the elder does when Traitor Tot is indicted and arrested.

@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast According to a rather flawed study. https://t.co/Po4RB66LXv
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast It’s not pennies when you know how they get in here and how a wall won’t change that.
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast Since they primarily come in on visas and then never leave, a physical barrier is going to cost more than it will ever save us.
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast Traffickers tend to come through the legal ports of entry as well, and not just at the land borders.
@JHawkin05 @mcmnadal @MollyJongFast We have walls where they need to be. More wall isn’t going to even remotely address the remaining problem. Walls work up to a point and we’re at that point here. We need to be looking at other options, not more wall.
@mcmnadal @JHawkin05 @MollyJongFast This is true. Members of the cartels themselves say they get drugs through primarily at ports of entry now through artful concealment.
@heathcat30 @alt_localgov Possibly, which both scares and infuriates me.
@realDonaldTrump False. But keep deluding yourself. We all know how far that’s getting you.
@RepMattGaetz Seeing as how the caravans tend to come to ports of entry to request asylum, your whole point is irrelevant. 		BTW, nobody is saying we’ll be LESS safe. They’re correctly pointing out that we won’t be any MORE safe, which makes the wall a waste of time and money.

@KimmGlass Trump himself only meets with Republicans and right-leaning groups despite needing to reach common ground with the Democrats. He could keep trying on that front and he won't. I mean, really, you think Trump and the Republicans are doing the work here?
@KimmGlass The House. They've been passing clean spending bills since Jan. 3. McConnell wouldn't even take them up despite the fact that he could be working to find enough votes for a veto-proof majority or an override should Trump veto it.
@CClayto71980380 @realDonaldTrump Oh hell no. Not at all. 😂

Short thread on "essential" and "non-essential" employees: https://t.co/SYbLdbfwYl
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump Oh, and one other thing @JonPulsipher: If non-essential meant unnecessary, why is the administration ordering more and more "non-essential" personnel back to work without pay? Could it be that they're...gasp...NECESSARY to the function of the country???
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump So, @JonPulsipher, I suggest you learn what "non-essential" means before you open your trap again. Because it doesn't mean "unnecessary."
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump FBI and the courts are essential functions but they have a lot of non-essential personnel who have been furloughed, which is making it tougher for them to do their jobs. Same with other agencies that are "essential;" they have important support personnel who have been furloughed.
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump In fact, we're watching this in slow-motion now. Each day that goes by without a deal is a day that's harder for the FBI to do its work, for the NTSB to do its work, for the judicial system to do its work (including immigration cases. You want people deported? We need the courts)
@JonPulsipher @platossidekick @realDonaldTrump The number of people who think "non-essential" means "unnecessary" is astonishing. Non-essential means not essential to the immediate safety and security of the country, not "unnecessary." Fire them all and watch how quickly the entire country grinds to a halt.
@nipperdawg Good to hear!
@nipperdawg I don't know for sure, but I don't think there's anything legally requiring any party to hold a primary. My problem with it is that canceling primaries takes away the voter's choice. The GOP doesn't care though; their authoritarian tendencies are getting worse.

@dc_lowe @marcorubio Who, me? Where did I say it wasn't?
@marcorubio Furthermore, nowhere in the article does it say this is a bad move. Why do you assume that "unusual and provocative" means "bad?" Because it's the L.A. Times? A.K.A. mainstream media?

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab So you’re fine with Trump acting like a dictator. Hypocrite, much?

So unless they're doing something I'm currently unaware of on that front, then on the surface, it looks to me like they're trying to tell other countries what we will and will not do AND what they will and will not allow. How low we've sunk.
We don't have the right to tell any country, "Hey, people are going to be coming to your country to apply for asylum here. And possibly there." We don't get to designate other countries as safe countries, pass-through countries, whatever, without their say so. 4/
And I don't understand why anybody in the government would think it is. We're looking at a potentially very long and difficult process to establish that kind of agreement with Central American countries, who are going to want things from us in return. 3/
I don't see how we get any of this to work without agreements with those countries over it. We don't have the right to just designate a foreign country a place to apply for asylum to the U.S. So this very likely isn't nearly as simple as changing our asylum law. 2/
I have not yet had the chance to read the Senate's new 1300 page bill. However, I did read somewhere that it would use the U.N.'s refugee criteria to determine who to grant asylum to and that it would require people to apply in their own countries or a designated neighbor. 1/

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab And you still haven't given me citations on incels being primarily leftists. Give me that citation, too.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Not really, but keep deluding yourself.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Or are protections for illegal aliens okay as long as he gets his wall? Can't even you keep your positions straight?
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab So then how do you feel about Trump saying he'd extend protections to DREAMers and people here under protected status until after the next election? "No illegals" is your mantra, after all.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab He had his wall twice. He said he would sign at least one of those bills. Then he went back on his word. Why did he say he'd sign it and then go back on his word? And why should we trust him to keep his word on anything now?
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab LMAO are you claiming to know the current situations and life experiences of over 300 million people now? Pardon me while I scoff yet again.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab You would know. Prove it. Give us a citation on that in addition to the citation on incels being leftists. STILL waiting on that one.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab You don't know the definition of the word "indefinite" then. You also still haven't given me a citation on incels being leftists.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Your position is quite clear. It positively oozes down my screen every time you tweet.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab All or nothing is not the way a democracy is supposed to work. Governing by taking hostages and demanding ransoms is not the way this is supposed to work. That's the very authoritarian work you people claim is so completely un-American that it's amazing you support it.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab He did promise to sign a bill that had the support of both houses of Congress with $1.6 billion for the wall and then reneged. He also rejected a Democratic bill that would have given him more than $20 billion for the wall in exchange for permanent protections for DREAMers.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab And Republicans will? My my my, aren't we clueless about the current state of American politics.
@MaryannDeruell1 @itsJeffTiedrich Russia, then? 😂😂😂
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Yep. Everything would have been fine had Trump not gone back on his word. There's a reason we have no reason to trust that he'll keep his word.
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Not without knowing the situations and life experiences of literally every single other person in America, which is impossible.
@Sci_Resistance Yes, if that means we can kick them into the sun.
@hhugh02 @AltUSDA_ARS I still hate kicking the can down the road. Not that I prefer keeping everything shut down if we can get everyone their owed pay, because I don't. But I hate kicking the can down the road. Especially with this president and all his sycophants.
@hhugh02 @AltUSDA_ARS I believe so, yes. All workers who have worked without pay AND all furloughed workers to receive back pay is my understanding.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Your sheer lack of empathy for anyone except your real lord and savior, Donald Trump, makes me seriously doubt that.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Baaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!! Pardon me while I scoff at you again.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab That doesn’t answer my question about a Dem president shutting down the government indefinitely because they aren’t getting what they want from Congress. 		And I’m STILL waiting for a cite about incels being leftists.
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab No, he’ll ORDER the Dem president to “go away...really...”
@AltUSDA_ARS If Trump actually signs something that doesn’t include his wall that only reopens the shuttered agencies for 2 weeks, then unless McConnell grows some balls and a sense of duty and finds a veto-proof majority for a longer term spending bill, this will just happen again in 2 weeks
@AltUSDA_ARS No. And now they’re just kicking the can down the road for two weeks instead of two months, and we STILL missed payroll a second time for everyone.
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab It’s funny: He supports Trump keeping the gov’t shut down till he gets what he wants. Democrats cave, he’ll keep doing it. And we run the risk of setting a bad precedent for future presidents to govern by hostage-taking and ransoms. What’ll he say when a Dem president does this?

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Slut-shaming and body-shaming are exactly what they sound like.
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab Not that I expect @AZ_TNO to publicly accept any of this. It’ll make him look like the frightened, insecure, and inadequate little man he is. There’s a study showing that male support for Trump is linked to fragile masculinity. His use of the word “beta” proves what he is.
@SentinelJust @AZ_TNO @MatthewJLavelle @AltNatSecAgency @jjmacnab It’s also the right that overwhelmingly sticks to rigid and outdated ideas of masculinity, which have given rise to the incel and MRA movement. That’s a big reason why their idea of masculinity is toxic. As women become more empowered, the right feels more threatened.

@JohnBalley1 @AOC Except I'm not talking about socialism (and socialism and communism are not the same thing). I'm talking about the type of tax system we used to have here in the States that incentivized even big business to invest in itself and its workforce.
@JohnBalley1 @AOC And there's the problem. Here in the U.S., wealth goes upward, not downward, in large part because low taxes doesn't incentivize anyone to invest in their companies and workforces. It incentivizes them to hoard their money. And everyday people suffer for it.

@JohnBalley1 @AOC Without those lovely good people, the rich people wouldn’t be rich. Nothing in a consumer economy works without workers or consumers. The rich cannot spend enough money to keep the economy going on their own.

@ajlongo4280 @caperclaw @Questergirl @LuisG1805 @Jesus_was_a_Lib Depends on the job. The higher and more specialized your skill level, the less you make compared to the private sector. Also, many lower level government jobs are in line with comparable private sector jobs. So.
@ajlongo4280 @Questergirl @LuisG1805 @Jesus_was_a_Lib “On the government dole.” Because government workers don’t have important functions, don’t pay any taxes, and don’t spend their money anywhere to help drive the economy.
@pjcND23 @ape_zim @KellySyp @LuisG1805 @Jesus_was_a_Lib 30 years ago that was possible. Today is not 30 years ago.
@LuisG1805 @Jesus_was_a_Lib Because it’s not that easy, maybe? “You should always have 3 months’ worth of bills saved up,” is outdated advice that comes from a time when most wages were fair wages.

@KaitMarieox They ensure that private organizations’ intellectual property remains protected so those companies can continue to profit off said property. Why do you want slaves doing that? Or would you prefer everyone be able to steal everyone else’s work? Might want to reconsider, dumbo.
@KaitMarieox Finally, no you don’t believe in government workers. One of Customs’ functions is enforcing trademarks and patents. You know, those things companies get FROM THE GOVERNMENT to protect their intellectual property? That’s right. CUSTOMS seizes counterfeit merchandise.
@KaitMarieox The only thing backwards here is you.
@KaitMarieox Oh, and the police officers forcibly entering a house with guns drawn? That LITERALLY doesn’t happen when you don’t pay your taxes. You are LYING THROUGH YOUR TEETH. SHUT. UP.
“If they are non-essential, then why are they being paid in the first place?” These total fucking morons don’t know what “non-essential means.” It means “not essential to national security,” not “They’re completely superfluous.” Otherwise we wouldn’t be ordering them back to work https://t.co/tSgw3UF0H9
@KaitMarieox “Non-essential” doesn’t mean what you think it means, imbecile. And you and everyone making your completely moronic argument about federal employees are also negating your arguments for the wall. You get NO border security without a large number of these currently-unpaid people.
@KaitMarieox Also, “non-essential employees” are #1: Furloughed, #2: Being reclassified as essential and ordered back to work to keep us going, and #3: Essential employees are the ones working without pay, you complete dipshit. Might want to learn this before making another stupid video.

@KaitMarieox The Coast Guard intercepts and seizes a fuckton of drugs every day, U.S. Customs denied hundreds of people entry to the country every day, as well as intercepts and seizes a fuckton of drugs and catches traffickers and their victims, and what do you think the Border Patrol does?
@KaitMarieox Government shutdowns cost us FAR more than they save, but I can’t really expect your sorry ass to understand that. What I DO expect your sorry ass to understand is that you want all those people protecting us from invaders to work for free. You want them to be slaves. FUCK YOU!!!

Side note: The DOJ only has data available up through FY2017. All of that was under Obama except 2017, which, for the purposes of this issue, falls under Trump. Obama’s rate is slightly better than Trump’s so far. I do admit thar a single year can easily be an outlier.
Indisputable FACT: Roughly 90% of asylum-seekers show up for their hearings. Contrary to Trump and his loyal subjects, they do not run “wild and free” and disappear. (Source: https://t.co/8u0kP2qous) https://t.co/kvVQYWo3Tu

@RodriguezBertie @altjellyroller @SecNielsen @DHSgov No, but once you request asylum, you don’t meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the U.S. and you won’t until they decide your case and either grant or deny asylum.

@cruisegrl71 @altjellyroller @SecNielsen @DHSgov Don't confuse the request with the decision. They're two separate things. The truth is that most will ultimately be denied. But until that decision is made, they don't meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the U.S.
@cruisegrl71 @altjellyroller @SecNielsen @DHSgov So lobby to change our asylum law. Right now, this is the law.

@Jim_Jordan And McConnell refused to allow yet another bill from the House to the Senate floor for a vote, and he’s completely forgotten the concept of a veto override, for which he could probably find the votes if he tried. Instead, he’s playing Trump’s “my way or the highway” game.

@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @marianan @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency But you yourself acknowledge the Supreme Court's primary mission every single time you bring up Dred Scott. The Constitution implicitly granted a legal right to own slaves. And as I said before, the word "implicit" is important. You'd do well to learn that.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @marianan @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency Um. The Supreme Court's whole job is to interpret the Constitution and the Constitutionality of any laws made by lawmakers. We can argue till the cows come home about whether said interpretations are good or bad, and Dred Scott isn't the only bad SCOTUS decision on the books.

@_Orwell @AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency @marianan To him and those who don't want to understand our history because it's too uncomfortable, there's no difference between the Constitution implicitly maintaining a legal right to own slaves, and calling the Constitution pro-slavery and racist.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency @_Orwell @marianan Basically, I was commenting on the fact that you don’t seem to understand your own source. Despite the Heritage Foundation’s known bias, that article does not say what you think it does and posting it multiple times won’t change that.
@AZ_TNO @SentinelJust @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency @_Orwell @marianan The Heritage Foundation is neither unbiased nor non-partisan, which suggests you’re unable or unwilling to do actual research and find actual scholarly work on this.
@GayannaG @senatemajldr When people understand that a majority of undocumented immigrants are visa overstays, and that drugs and human trafficking mostly come in through ports of entry, then they should understand that a wall is a waste of money. Things have drastically changed in the last ten years.
@spottedTB Even with his own hotel right up the street, there would have been some planning involved. They probably can’t just throw together a catered meal for an entire football team on a whim. But planning is thinking and working, and he doesn’t do any of that.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda That’s not what I said. I said you must have seen everyone’s scores and score breakdowns so you know that POC are only passing the testing because of that advantage.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Seeing as how white people have different lived experiences than non-white people, in this case, saying POC is perfectly relevant because you dismiss their lived experiences by claiming colorblindness.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Now you’re just being a full-on racist.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I assume you saw everyone’s scores as well as how all the scores broke down and therefore KNOW that any POC who outscored you and other white people only did so because of that “advantage.” LOL I’ve been through the process, too. They don’t publish everyone’s info like that.
@N0__S0ul @jayreeder15 @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I’m waiting to hear something about how POC just need to learn how to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, like white people do. And maybe a story or link or something opining about how the problem is with POC and not the institutions white people have created.
@HumboldtBunny But that’s...that’s...oh I can barely say it...AMNESTY. The horror! The sheer and absolute horror.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda So interpret them logically and demonstrate your logic.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Yes, a little bit, because systemic racism is still very much a problem. It’s just a lot more subtle, and therefore, much more insidious, than it was back when racism was okay.
@jayreeder15 @AltNatSecAgency @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda So? That means nothing. I could say there are lots of people who disagree that the Earth is round. Doesn’t make it true.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Nobody “gave” me a filter. Nobody taught me to interpet statistics any one specific way. I did have to take statistics courses in college but they were straight math courses, not sociology courses. What other way is there to interpret these stats?
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I didn’t say that only white people have opportunity. I didn’t even come close to that. The statistics I gave you indicate that equality of opportunity is still sorely lacking, meaning not everyone has equal access. That’s a far cry from “only white people have opportunity.”
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda When you say that you don’t care about race or class, you’re dismissing the lived experiences of entire segments of our population.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda To sum it up, you’re looking at specific instances of people of color succeeding and not at overall trends. Is it better than it was 60 years ago? A little. But the lived experiences of people of color are vastly different from the lived experiences of white people.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda I wouldn’t expect a majority-black police force in a majority-white town, for instance. If the town’s black population is, say, 30%, then a police force that’s 95% white could be said to be a problem.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda It should be noted that a police force that fairly represents the demographics of the areas they serve will vary from locale to locale.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda People of color in general, not just black people, made up just 27% of local police departments across the U.S. in 2013. That was a whopping 12% increase from 1987, so I doubt it’s changed significantly in the last six years.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda White people, specifically white men, overwhelmingly hold the power here. White men make up around 30% of our population, but 76% of all elected GOP officials and 55% of all elected Democratic officials are white men. They make up roughly 70% of large-company senior executives.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Maybe, but it’s true.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Finally, there are all the women who come here WITH the ability to live independently, including paying all their own medical expenses, and have babies. We’ve seen a sharp rise in women from Russia doing this. And there isn’t a damned thing we can do about it.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda So coming here and having babies isn’t an especially good way to ensure legal immigration later, nor does it guarantee we’ll let you stay here.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Also, there’s nothing that stops us from deporting the parents of a child born here. All we do is try to ensure the child has someone legally present to raise them, or we put them into the system. They can’t sponsor relatives for immigration until they’re 21.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda It’s not illegal to come here and have a baby. We do try to reduce it by denying entry to women who appear to be coming here to have babies without any way to pay the expenses they incur. But we can’t stop it without ending jus soli, which means amending the Constitution.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda To end jus soli and therefore end birth tourism, or as you put it, “anchor babies,” you have to amend the Constitution. Jus soli is codified in the 14th Amendment. And as such, any baby born on American soil, whether to an undocumented immigrant or not, is a U.S. citizen.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda By all means, prove me wrong.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @Mafooli @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda You “personally know?” As in you were there and witnessed it? If not, then provide the citation. Although I already know the answer to this.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Those that get caught DO get sent back over the border unless they request asylum. If they do that, all the arresting authority can do is assign them a case and wait until it’s decided. Until said case is decided, they don’t meet the definition of unauthorized presence.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda If you want to end jus soli, you’ll have to amend the Constitution. There’s no other way to end jus soli.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Sorry, but many “anchor babies” are born to women who enter the U.S. on visas when they’re pregnant. Others are born to people who are here on work visas, student visas, or other long-term visas. Very few are born to women who illegally cross the southern border.

@Mafooli @jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda And when we don’t learn from it, we repeat it.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda We also have border apprehension numbers to go by, along with other information. No, we don’t have an exact count of undocumented immigrants and how they got here, but we have a rather solid idea.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda There are penalties for overstaying a visa, but we can’t apply and enforce them until the next time that person tries to enter the U.S., or unless they’re caught some other way.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Once they enter on a visa, we have them in the system, along with the dates at which they are supposed to exit. We also monitor visa exits. Hence we have a good idea of how many overstay their visas and where they’re from.
@jayreeder15 @Mafooli @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda You don’t get to say anything about sounding intelligent when it’s clear you haven’t yet read any of the links I sent you.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda No. The uptick from other regions doesn’t make a wall a feasible plan, especially since illegal entries over the southern border have been steadily declining for the last 15 years.

@N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @jayreeder15 @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda In theory, it would be much harder to evade drones and other electronic surveillance, cheaper and quicker to install and maintain, and easier to hire personnel for since at least some of the work could be done remotely.

@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Yes, as in they have visas, other paperwork as necessary, and they’re cleared for entry into the U.S. That is true for drug smugglers, human traffickers, and undocumented immigrants.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda Nope, and I’m going to have to ask you for citations on that.
@jayreeder15 @N0__S0ul @alt_4nTrade @AltNatSecAgency @RogueUSMint @AltUSPressSec @AltDIA @RogueFirstLady @alt_localgov @AltUSDA_ARS @alt_fda A majority, and they come in legally on visas at ports of entry. How is a wall going to stop that?

@marianan @AZ_TNO @_Orwell @alt_localgov @AltNatSecAgency When I first saw it I thought, “Nah, can’t happen.” Then I watched serious anti-intellectualism begin to take a real hold on conservative thinking, and as it got worse I just thought, “I never thought Idiocracy would be anything more than a fun, but dumb movie.”

You wouldn’t know it to hear their sorry racist asses talk, though. The wall is a perfect example of willful ignorance borne out of xenophobia, racism and general fear, which are fueled by lies, not facts.
The truth is that back then we DID have a problem. Now we have a fraction of that problem at the southern border. Illegal crossings have dropped steadily since then.
You know what’s REALLY sad about the #MAGAts, their despotic lord and savior, and their insistence on the wall? They keep bringing up things Democrats said about a physical barrier back in ‘04, ‘05, ‘06 as though we have at least as many, if not more, crossing the border now.

@Skunk131313 It’s not. This is nothing like a vacation, and I’m livid with the people who are saying shit like, “They’re getting a free vacation,” or as someone I know personally said, “Gee, I wish my boss would give me weeks of vacation like this.”

I'm done playing nice with you jackasses and I have no more patience to pretend otherwise. I'm not playing nice with you anymore. Don't like it? Block me. Offended? Suck it up, buttercup, or fuck off.
You're sick. You pathetic. You want us to stop looking at you and talking about you with disdain? Then stop giving us reasons to do so, like believing every slimy word that issues from Trump's disgusting mouth. He's not one of you, but you're too willfully stupid to see that.
And you blindly follow him, and wonder why we "liberal elitists" look down our noses at you. It's because you can't even be bothered to try and learn. It's because you moan about being this horribly persecuted class as though your demographics DON'T hold most of the power here.
@brewsandbats For those on a pay schedule that overlapped the shutdown deadline, yes. Not every federal worker is on the same pay schedule though, so some were shorted, but others weren't.
You think Trump cares about you? Don't make me laugh. He cares about himself and nobody else. Including you. Jobs aren't coming back. His trade wars are driving prices up. Your wages are stagnant and your tax refund will probably be smaller this year.
I have had it with you whiny shits. I'm done with your willful ignorance. And I'm sick of hearing about how the liberal elitists look down on you and alienate you. There are more so-called "liberal elitists" than there are of you, and it's time for you to put up and shut up.
You support the most morally bankrupt man on the planet because he caters to your basest fears and instincts. You don't support Americans. You don't support America. You have no moral compass and it's time for you to stop pretending you do.
Dear #MAGAshits:	I'm not playing nice with you anymore. Many employees affected by the shutdown were shorted on the last paycheck they received. All have now missed a full paycheck. Thousands are about to miss a second paycheck. And it's your fault, you stupid fucking hypocrites.
@Willloves2hunt @Keystuk @luciddreamingLA @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump That's because we are, and we're sick to death of hearing you people whine about our disdain for you. You want us to stop looking down on you? Then stop giving us reasons to see you as stupid, backward and classless.

@Patjustobservin @cridings1 @luciddreamingLA @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump Makes more sense to address the bigger problem first, and then decide how to stop the rest. Of course, that comes with accepting the fact that we will never stop 100% of everything. The wall is a waste of money and not worth forcing 1000s of workers into involuntary servitude.
@luciddreamingLA @Airvooocht @realDonaldTrump Facts matter, you brainwashed jackass. You’d do well to learn them. What’s that? I’m making shit up? I’m paying too much attention to talking points from the Fake News Media? Then show me otherwise with REAL sources, or don’t bother to respond.

They didn’t, so the people who whine about Obamacare not working can shove it.
@WalshFreedom No.
This may be a case where I thought I knew more than I truly did. The stumbling block for Trump’s admin is a consent decree that governs how minors are to be treated while they’re detained.

@realDonaldTrump Hey shitwaffle, we have more control over the southern border now than we’ve had at anytime in the last two decades. Illegal border crossings have been falling steadily since 2004, and are down 90% since 2000. STOP. LYING. ABOUT. THE BORDER.

@Vayhi @DonaldJTrumpJr 😱😱😱
@Vayhi I’m sure they are.
@Vayhi It’s funny, small gov’t conservatives think that more gov’t workers = a less productive nation. They think gov’t workers means fewer workers producing. Yet the percentage of gov’t workers in the general workforces in the most productive countries in the world is all over the map.
@Vayhi ...and that things will be a million times worse because we won’t have the manpower to do anything. The whole country would grind to a halt. But since Trump’s favorite pundits equate the federal workforce to the gov’t’s size, yeah. He probably thinks he’s “draining the swamp.”
@Vayhi We do know that a lot of the idiot pundits in his base think that getting rid of federal workers = shrinking gov’t. They don’t seem to get that you could get rid of half the federal workforce and the gov’t would be just as big because all the laws and regs are still there...

@OutOfTheBlue201 @AddieHillman1 @realDonaldTrump “Do some research.” Maybe do some research on how asylum law is actually applied instead of assuming you know how it works just from reading a couple of things.
@OutOfTheBlue201 @AddieHillman1 @realDonaldTrump No on both points. They can request asylum each time they come, but the first denial makes it much harder to ever get an approval on subsequent requests. 		International law only requires Mexico to offer asylum, which they did. There is nothing requiring migrants to accept it.
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump And most of our visa overstays come from countries to which the travel ban did not apply, so again, what does that have to do with anything?

@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump So, again, what does that have to do with the border and asylum?
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump The travel bans have nothing to do with the caravans since the caravans aren’t coming from countries to which that ban ever applied.
@OutOfTheBlue201 @realDonaldTrump Oh? Do explain, and show your work.
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump And that has what to do with border crossings and asylum?
@OutOfTheBlue201 @AddieHillman1 @realDonaldTrump It’s worth noting, though, that the language of 8 U.S.C. 1158 makes it so the request for asylum trumps our definition of illegal entry. https://t.co/K6kgJh1Pbb
@dinodlz @DonaldJTrumpJr No. Well, I had Taco Bell for dinner but no alcohol at all. Maybe the Taco Bell caused it?
@YouTweaked @realDonaldTrump Most come in perfectly legally on legit visas and disappear. Less than 30% come across the border illegally. Furthermore, illegal border crossings have dropped 90% since 2000. The number spiked in 2005, and has been falling steeply and fairly steadily since then.
@OutOfTheBlue201 @realDonaldTrump Coming to the border and requesting asylum is not. Which is what they were doing.

@AltNatSecAgency Sigh. I wish I knew where people were getting the idea that we have a safe country agreement with Mexico. We have one with Canada, but not Mexico.  And if we are to apply international refugee law, all Mexico has to do is offer asylum. There’s nothing requiring them to take it.
@DocbobLV False. They are not required by any law to accept asylum in Mexico or anywhere else. And to apply for asylum, 8 U.S.C. 1158 states that you must be within our physical land borders. Embassies and consulates don’t qualify as inside our physical land borders.

@JesseGiesbrecht @QuestioningMor1 This one is claiming they never said an awful lot of things they’ve said a billion times.
@JesseGiesbrecht @QuestioningMor1 And now they’re “just fucking with us.” That’s what they do when they’re thoroughly humiliated and need to save what’s left of their pride.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht DUH you have to tell them why! It’s how they get to your “why” and what they do with it that we’re discussing. And you are wrong about how that’s done. 		But then again, you’re just fucking with me, or so you want people to think so you can save face. 😂😂😂
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Baaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaa okay. If that’s how you want to “own” us, go ahead.
@JesseGiesbrecht @QuestioningMor1 I think there are two things going on here: General problems with reading comprehension coupled with a lack of understanding of how to follow Twitter threads. (And the Dunning-Kruger Effect, as you said.)
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Amazing. Every word you just said is wrong.
@altCourierSix Oi.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Okay then, if I’m wrong you tell me the process. The whole process from start to finish.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht When you ask for asylum they take you to get your case going. You get assigned an asylum officer (from USCIS, not CPB, ICE or Border Patrol) who evaluates your case and presents it to immigration court for a decision. CBP, ICE and B0 don’t have the authority to deny your request.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You have no clue what you’re talking about. Not one clue.
@jimsciutto @StormResist His base.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Nope. What I said is how it works. Any officer who does otherwise is breaking the law and subject to disciplinary action.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht And people who are denied entry to the U.S. who don’t want to go home can request asylum, at which point CBP’s hands are tied and all they can do is get the paperwork for their case going and send them to whatever facility that particular port uses. That’s literally how it works.
@altCourierSix Someone I know elsewhere is saying Trump made a specific and special request to allow photos with several servicemembers. Have you heard anything like that?
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht That literally happens to no one unless officers are breaking the law.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht No, it cannot. It may only be a few days, but no. You cannot be denied immediately.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You’re confusing the request with the decision. In practice, those are two separate things. Nobody who requests asylum is denied on the spot. They may be denied within 6-12 days, but not on the spot. An officer breaks the law by denying an asylum request on the spot.

@altCourierSix @altGS_rocks Ah okay.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Keep in mind we're talking about the request, not the decision.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Not followed by whom? "Whether or not at a designated port of arrival, irrespective of such alien's status," means regardless of where and how they came in, regardless of where and how they requested asylum, and regardless of whether they're here legally or not. https://t.co/6ROVdmliEu

@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht And they are legally allowed to do it that way. 🤷‍♀️
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Those new laws are EOs, not laws, and have been blocked. So 8 U.S.C 1158 stands.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht At which point they're given a case and a court date and do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the U.S. until their case is decided.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht I never bitched about anything. I was expressing confusion over a video that purports to show Trump saying the border wall is a gift to the Coast Guard, when the wall has zilch to do with the Coast Guard. You put words in my mouth from the beginning.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht That's not merely interpretation of the law. It's literally what 8 U.S.C. 1158 says. You get picked up by ICE somewhere and you request asylum? Their hands are tied at that point. You get denied entry to the U.S. and request asylum to avoid getting sent home? CBP's hands are tied
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht If you're granted asylum, you get to stay. If you're denied, you get ordered removed from the U.S. But, per 8 U.S.C. 1158, between the time you get assigned a case and the time your case is decided, you do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the country.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You confuse the request with the grant. You can request asylum anywhere within our physical land borders. Once you request it, you are given a case and a court date and you do not meet the definition of unauthorized presence in the country until your case is decided.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht The Democrats don't have a plan. What the hell makes you think I'm a Democrat? The fact that you don't like what I say means I'm a Dem and I blindly follow them and love everything they do? You lost that one, buddy. They have no plan and that pisses me off.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Answer #4: https://t.co/kduhnRslsj
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht I've answered the only question on this thread twice. Here's a third: https://t.co/xXHDPZ4tgM
@QuestioningMor1 @HangNeal Better than you, apparently. The only thing the wall has to do with the Coast Guard is the possibility that more people will try to enter the U.S. via the Gulf, making their job more difficult, not easier.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Wrong. Anywhere within our physical land borders means they can do it at the airports, they can turn themselves into ICE, CBP or the Border Patrol at any station they like, and they can cross the border anywhere and still request asylum as soon as they encounter authorities.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht I'm guessing you have no idea how to read a Twitter thread. You asked where Comey entered the conversation, as though it wasn't you who brought him in.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht And once more, literally nobody was talking about immigration here until you said something.
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Yeah I've twice posted a screencap of where Comey entered the conversation. Want me to post it a third time?
@QuestioningMor1 @HangNeal Do you even know what the Coast Guard does? What the National Guard does?
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht You creeping my feed: https://t.co/6tgy3M3AML
@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht They can ask for asylum anywhere within our physical land borders, and anywhere along the land borders. Try again.

@QuestioningMor1 @HangNeal Now, do you want to tell me who the hell brought up immigration policy in either thread? The only thing I ever said anything about was the video that sounded like Trump said the wall was a gift to the Coast Guard.
@QuestioningMor1 @HangNeal It's also a fundamental truth that you will believe what you want, so it's pretty pointless of me to try and insist I'm anything other than what you think. *shrug*

@QuestioningMor1 @JesseGiesbrecht Literally nobody said anything on either of these threads on which you're creeping me about border security. You're asking questions about things nobody has said to you.
@IsobelCarr And, since DHS technically no money and is technically not operating, there's no money for any new contracts for wall construction or anything else under that department's purview.
@IsobelCarr Essential personnel must continue to work during a shutdown, but they work without knowing when they'll next be paid.
@IsobelCarr Actually, there is an awful lot of DHS that's furloughed. That includes HR, so people who were planning to retire on Dec. 31st will have to keep working until DHS is funded again because there are no HR personnel to handle their final paperwork and paychecks.

@Punch_You @KristinTangel @RosaGoldensohn Like an elderly person who passed away quietly in their sleep, or someone passing away after losing their battle with a long illness. To me, that’s what that term always applied to. This child died in federal custody. To say anything else is to gloss over his death.
@QuestioningMor1 Someone doesn’t like being called out on stupid comments. To reiterate: You asked a stupid question about borders and the water, and I asked what that has to do with the Coast Guard. I must have embarrassed the hell out of you because that’s when the insults started.
@QuestioningMor1 “Trolling retards,” as you so &lt;ahem&gt; eloquently put it involves creeping their feeds? I hope you work a solo midnight shift. That’s just skeezy.
@QuestioningMor1 And this is an invalid comparison. Try harder.
@QuestioningMor1 And that has what to do with the Coast Guard?
@QuestioningMor1 Why are you creeping my Twitter feed? You obsessed with me already? I must really have gotten to you.

If I were you, I’d find another historical empire to be ignorant about.
@jcpowell1285 @AltWASONPS @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Your revisionist history is part of why we’re having such problems learning from history. Yesterday’s Democrats are today’s Republicans - that is a fact. And facts matter.
@jcpowell1285 @AltWASONPS @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The Roman Empire fell because of endless war and because it was too top-heavy. While we don’t have slaves any more, just as the Roman Empire was too heavily dependent on slave labor, so too are we on cheap labor? Gee...who champions economic policy that makes us too top-heavy?
@jcpowell1285 @AltWASONPS @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And you say you grew up in Georgia as if you know where any of us grew up. Or live now.
@jcpowell1285 @AltWASONPS @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If you knew history you’d know what a paradigm shift is. The Democrats of those days, all the way through the Civil Rights movement, are today’s Republicans. The passage of the Civil Rights Act was the final straw for the last remaining racist holdouts in the Democratic Party.

It can also make my heart race.
@AltNatSecAgency @emrazz Yes, people don’t get this.
@KristinTangel @RosaGoldensohn It’s a more comfortable term than “dies,” “death,” etc. It feels...I don’t know...”prettified?”
RT @ALT_GSA: I haven’t found ONE federal worker who believes this, let alone ONE federal worker whom has magically been able to get word to…
@bobeck_candice @john_prokop @realDonaldTrump But seeing as how you’re probably a bot...I don’t know why I’m bothering with you. 😂😂😂😂
@bobeck_candice @john_prokop @realDonaldTrump BTW...next time you start a tweet with “fact check,” it would serve you well to have a citation to accompany your “fact check.”
@bobeck_candice @john_prokop @realDonaldTrump No he didn’t. It was their money to begin with and we were holding it as part of the sanctions we had on them. If I’m holding $10 of yours and I give it back to you, did I give you your money or did I pay you $10 of mine?

@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What is so hard about answering some simple questions? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Please retweet if you understand that Trumpers have no clue about anything and contribute nothing of value to any discussion of any issue at all! Hashtags work! #TrumpChristmasShutdown #TrumpResign https://t.co/MkU5JD2Z8I
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS “He’s not done yet.” Ah, the old standby when someone can’t give a real answer a question. The problem is that doesn’t add up, seeing as how he’s given Congress 3 months to fund the wall already. 3 months isn’t enough time for the master dealmaker to make a deal for some money?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS “Trump will if they don’t.” Well, they didn’t, so why didn’t he instead of shutting down DHS and screaming about Democrats not playing ball?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You’re still not answering anything I’ve asked. I never said anything about our immigration policy and certainly not about any EOs. I asked why Trump didn’t just bypass Congress and have DoD start on the wall when it became clear Congress wasn’t going to do its job. Answer that.
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If he can just bypass Congress because they won’t do their jobs, why didn’t he?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS That doesn’t answer my questions. Yes he said that. So? Why didn’t he just do it, then, and avoid this whole mess altogether? Why shut down DHS if he can just have the military build the wall?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump How impressive. 🙄🙄🙄 That’s indicative of nothing except your own ego. Answer my questions.
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Also, why did CBP award two contracts with the ACoE in November if this is a DoD thing?
@jcpowell1285 @judahariel @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And I asked if you read what I said because I literally said that DoD had already gotten its FY2019 funding.
