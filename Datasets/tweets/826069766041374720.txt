RT @NJ_2_FL: @TRUMPMOMENTS411 @InAbsentia9 It's awesome and will take you back to your youth. I encourage you to try an episode. It's funny…
RT @NJ_2_FL: @TRUMPMOMENTS411 @InAbsentia9 😂😂 We had to get up to change the channel and use tinfoil and rabbit ears to tune it in.
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 Recording it. I watch 80s stuff all the time.
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 Wow, it’s been around a while. Only recently heard of it. On demand is a beautiful thing.
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 I haven’t seen it, looks good though.
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 Nice to meet you, btw😊
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 But we had the 80s. Wouldn’t trade that in for anything! My son is forever jealous:)

@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 Lol, that’s my husband’s go to when they’re complaining about how “stressful” life is!.
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 I hear you, my oldest just turned 27, and my “babies” are 20.

@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 I know, don’t blink.

@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 Or, as my kids put it, “way back in your day.” 😔
@NJ_2_FL @InAbsentia9 Me too, I was in 8th grade geometry when they announced it and rolled a tv in to turn on the news. #RememberChristaMcAuliffe

@CarticulusMedia @RealCandaceO @Alyssa_Milano I don’t agree with her on many things, but I think, in this case, she wasn’t using the race card, she was making a point because Alyssa is clearly among the loudest hypocrites out there.

@AlexisinNH @awanamike She’ll fail epically. And that’s on just the skeletons we know about at this point.
