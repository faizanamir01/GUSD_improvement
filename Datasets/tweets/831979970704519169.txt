@RamsNFL Why are our DBs one foot shorter than opponents receiver, and the linebackers look like they weigh 190 lbs.????
@RamsNFL Ok great, open 2nd 1/2 with a TD drive and we’re back in it, defense gotta gotta do something. Fowler seems to be just another skinny linebacker no impact on anything easy to block.
@StillShaneGray Yup, Rams exposed, so freaking sad, Sam weaknesses on defense. McKay’s puts his tail between his legs on offense, had odd east west to Gurley on one possession on 3rd down really?
@MylesASimmons @RamsNFL Rams exposed, all big games will show your weaknesses, weak in the same areas as usual.
@RamsrbacknLA Why are our DBs always one foot shorter than the opp receivers
@RamsNFL No adjustments on defense, well they did go man, still no rush. McVay going conservative on offense go figure?
@RamsrbacknLA Can’t get to the QB, no adjustments by Phillips, same result, 28-14 shortly.
@MylesASimmons @RamsNFL Now what, east west hand off to Gurley has saints defense in the back field waiting for him, they know he’s no decoy!
@RamsNFL Need some pass rush
@RamsrbacknLA Missed tackles , linebackers! But they can’t stop us either, and I think our defense will stiffen.
@RamsNFL Can’t find a linebacker stronger than any running back in the league !!!
@RamsNFL Usual Rams weak linebackers!!
