@NMTerry1962 @bragg_lori @The_Trump_Train To you this all feels kinda like a Football game huh?
@dbongino 8yrs later. Give Trump all the credit. Claim Obama Ruined your life and Black People are Racist😶😶😶😶😶😶.
@dbongino Let's continue: the Year Obama Was Elected was also the Worse Economic year in recent History. These Same Anti-Identity people were in a Panic. The News didn't cover Tweets it Covered People losing their homes. Soaring Gas Prices, failing corporations. Record unemployment.
@dbongino Let's continue. Obama is a Columbia Grad Harvard Law Review President, Constitution Law Professor. Community Organizer 4yr Senator. However the only Reason he won was his Color. However our current President wasn't Elected Not based on he's White but his  4yr degree from Warton😶
@dbongino This is a Racist thread and as the only Qualified person on here to identify Racism. I want you to pay attention to certain things. You have One fellow👆Who insist Obama is from Kenya. He is Not. No matter how many time he says it. Obama was Born in Hawaii. Racism majes you crazy
@usaforamericans @dbongino So why didn't you answer the Question. So if you can't answer a question the solution is just casually change the subject😅😅

@RolloofRosslyn @ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike That has no bearing on a person shooting up a Church or a Mosque or a Synogouge. Libral Smibral. - You wanna blame everything on Liberals. But Republicans launched a War in the Middle East killing Thousands of people So don't be acting like Jesus is a Republican.
@RolloofRosslyn @ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike I know why Black crimes are committed son. Gangs.economics, Family Displacement. That's old stuff studied by some of the best to ever do it. Naw... why do White people just start Blasting in movie theaters.and churches?

@dbongino Tar and Feathering with Identity Politics😶😶😶😶😶 ummmm but🙋🙋🙋i gotta ask. Is claiming an American Citizen that was Voted for Unanimously. Is Really an foreign Agent born in Kenya👈👈😶😶. Is that considered " Identity Politics?" Asking for a friend.
@jparrambide @OliverMcGee @BarackObama You Corny
@Lisa_Milicaj @OliverMcGee @BarackObama Are you sure? Because that was George Bush's final yr. He was to the Right and Y'all fucked up the whole World. Had us in the biggest financial crisis in History since the Great Depression. And you are now claimimg responsibility
@marietweetss @OliverMcGee @BarackObama 2008 was the Yr of the Worse Financial crisis since the great depression. So i hope you woke up and went straight to the unemployment office. I bet we all woke up then.
@tgaila @OliverMcGee @BarackObama Well maybe you were not losing your home in 2008. Maybe you were not paying 7.00g gas. Maybe you didnt lose your Job. Maybe you didn't stand in line 5hr at the unemployment line. But those of us who did don't regret our Vote. This time I'm Voting for the best candidate not party
@OliverMcGee @BarackObama How about you just Vote for people who are Smart and Intelligent. That have A Good education pay Taxes and you wouldn't mind living next door too. Because news Flash you aren't a Democrat or Republican. You live in a Democratic Republic. There is a Difference.

@Jillibean557 @alistairpge But then again it might be 12 dead instead of 11. Armed guards are not Bulletproof. So that's not the solution. You would do better with a 12foot fence around the perimeter and Remote access. Nobody dies that way.

@DiamondandSilk I don't even think these 2 are Real people. I'm thinking clones. See how the one on the left keeps Rolling her neck. Black People don't try that hard to be Black. Its like she's got a Rubber Neck.Telling y'all something about these two. They even claim that Trump is the new MLK😶

@drawandstrike "Pimping of the Black Lives Matter??"😶 wow.. White people are the most disrespectful muthafuckaz. What the Fuck do you care if BLM gets pimped. They can kill every Nigger in this country. You just want us to shut up about it. Oh and Salute the flag Nigger. Right?

@PaigeMcLaughl19 @TrumpsDC @Mia_Green2020 News Flash. White people have been racist my whole life and I'm 47. Obama Had nothing to do with that. I just met him 8yrs ago. The only Reason Race has become an issue is because of how White People starting Abusing the guy. Talking about he was Born in Kenya. We saw that.
@raisestrongboys @TrumpsDC @Mia_Green2020 I have those stations On. He said Obama said that because he was White he was Racist. I don't remember hearing that. Show it to me.
@The_RandomGary @Trillfact @JackPosobiec @BarackObama Do you know anyone Black? Ask them if you lived in the same building that was all white. People come and go all day. When He/she came in the building the Tenants startes Flipping out claiming you this person can't live here there is no way. Ask that person what they would think
@The_RandomGary @Trillfact @JackPosobiec @BarackObama Yes I'm writting him off. My BROTHER KNOWS WHERE I WAS BORN! But regardless that's his family and thats personal. You ain't his brother. I tell my sister she is adopted all the time. Sometimes i think she is. But THAT'S MY SISTER. OBAMA'S BROTHER HAD A DIFFERENT REASON.
@RolloofRosslyn @ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike We are talking about " Mass " shootings so. Long as POC qualifies for Unloading an assult Rifle in a mall killing more then 3ppl. I don't want you changing the Subject to crimes of passion and all these individuals killings..MASS SHOOTING. Boy you a slippery little guy
@RolloofRosslyn @ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike Ok i give up. Who is POC and since i like in the 3rd biggest city in America I should be able to attest to these mass shootings.
@The_RandomGary @Trillfact @JackPosobiec @BarackObama It's Racist. Did anyone ever ask any other complexion President where his Birth certificate was? If 43 of you and Closes White Friends were standing in a Room and a Black Guy came in and all of a Sudden Someone walked up to him and asked to see his Birth Certificate.😶😶😶
@JillLog91645576 @Shiningtheligh1 @DiamondandSilk Oh you can see MLK voting for a White President that Dictates to Black Athletes whom are PEACEFULLY PROTECTING the INNOCENT KILLING of Unarmed BLACK CHILDREN Telling their Bosses to Take away their Jobs and Calling their Mom's Bitches😶😶What MLK You talking about?
@tjbrowndiver @drawandstrike He was the Worse President in US history. Though he was Voted in 2wice Through Popular Vote and College Electoral? The Worse President in US history? Through Clinton and Nixon were impeached? And George Bush Bankrupted the Economy? The Worse One?Wow. Let's explore this more
@tjbrowndiver @drawandstrike Worse President? That's just it. He wasn't the Worse President ever. Not even close. But i got a feeling You know that. Everyone's memory isn't that short. You attacked the man Claiming He was a Kenyan and not a Citizen. All while he dragged you from Economic Collapse.
@JillLog91645576 @Shiningtheligh1 @DiamondandSilk I can't laughing when Democrats and Republicans play the blame game with Slavery😅😅. It's about the only thing in America that was bipartisan😅😅.  MLK would have never voted for Trump. Its Called Content of Character. Malcolm X would have exploded about Trumps attack on the NFL
@The_RandomGary @Trillfact @JackPosobiec @BarackObama Again🙇 The Birther Movement.

@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike The owners name is Woodforest Bank. I play Adult league. And we have the National anthem. And i kneel every time.

You just only ses life through your own eyes. It's not your children and shit. What do you care..Yea well we feel the same. Fuck everybody
@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike I play football. The game doesn't start till kickoff. If you got you a pair of Binoculars watching the sideline during intermission. Then I know and You Know. You didn't come to see football. Especially since most people are at the concession stand. But ok.
@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike Kaepernick is a NFC Champion and a Superbowl contestant. We can name lots of QBs that haven't come close. But that's irrelevant. George Zimmerman's Color is Irrelevant. And If you are my Boss and I'm in the parking lot before the clock starts You can't tell me Shit.
@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike Did you just Reverse what i said? I said it's hard for me to sympathize with you being Trolled when our Protest of People Dying and their killers being set free was met by a  Hostile President That called their mothers Bitches in reply. Now if that is Civility. Then count me out
@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike We are not just talking about Colin Kaepernick. There were a lot more Players then one.
@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike I apologize if I'm not moved to tears.But hey Travon Mother couldn't pry tears from your eyes.Brown's family are still put their lives back together. We. Protested to No Empathy. Aa a matter of Fact NFL players Were threatened and their mothers called bitches. You gotta give some
@rixxbiz @fred_guttenberg No.. We tried to have that Debate with you before people died. It's a little late for talking. Just talk to your base.

@TrumpsDC @Mia_Green2020 So i Googled it... I Guess just like you said it " Obama said people where Racist because they are white " That's not a True Statement. Obama never said that.
@raslady1 @foxandfriends @RealCandaceO He ain't running shit but his mouth😅.
@RolloofRosslyn @ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike Babylon?😶 really?😶
@OfficeOfMike @drawandstrike Then you think he would have called the Neo Nazi's that marched though Charlottesville like this was Schindler's List Some Son's of Bitches. You know, instead of NFL players.

@TrumpsDC @Mia_Green2020 Is that the Proof i asked you for or are you changing the Subject. You made a pretty harsh alligation against Obama. I'd like to see the Proof.
@AngeloRayGomez @VincentKevinHo4 @realDonaldTrump Well Banning large Religious Groups, Condoning White Nationalist Protesters, Demonizing immigrants, Dictating to Black NFL players forced Patriotism, Grabbing Woman by the Pussy, Propagating the The President Was Born in Kenya wth no logically Reason other than he black.

@staceydash Did any of them secure a job in the West Wing? Asking for a friend
@dcexaminer Well since They are running out in public shooting at people. Not knowing who will be Shooting back. I think they've already turned the consequences over in their head and concluded that they don't give a Rats Ass.
@ItsJustMe122 @drawandstrike Well his Presidential Opinion is consistent with Anti-Semitism and Bigotry. That's was my point to begin with😶. Oh and We are all immigrants
@ItsJustMe122 @drawandstrike He doesn't propagate the Black NFL Players lose their Jobs if they don't Swollow forced Patriotism?	He doesn't Demonize illegal immigrants?
@marklutchman @raslady1 @RealCandaceO Really.. Give just one example.. Just One.. And Please say Some low paying jobs.. Just give one example
@thecjpearson @mellynvegas I beg to differ..
@PositiveVictory @drawandstrike And it didn't help your looks either
@bud_cann @AprilJkcorp Well i take it you didn't buy Gin&amp;Juice it was a classic album
@KSG01217293 Yea.. Show us one of Adults
@GOP You wish

@foxandfriends @raslady1 @RealCandaceO For once You are right. Not even Obama can fix stupid.

@larryelder @raslady1 So
@HillaryClinton Thank You Madame President
@niagarasays @alpipkin @drawandstrike The President is to Stupid to be Racist. And that is the Problem. And idiot that only understands how to play the victim. And not understanding by Victimizing himself he Victimizes Racist People that support him thay then go out and want vengeance on Fake Victimization.
@Jeanjeannie20 @trishwakeford @drawandstrike That's what we asked Trump. Vote for me and I'd be specific. You know, so i don't accidentally encourage Neo Nazi's to Shoot up Synagogues.
@Garywagoner3 @alpipkin @drawandstrike Stop talking about Plantations. You don't know what the Fuck you are talking about. If you are trying to make some Dumb Ass Reference to Slavery. That was a All White Principal.A Bipartisan One asshole. So don't start down that Road.
@itjustis9022 @alpipkin @drawandstrike Nope just calling it like i see it.
@niagarasays @alpipkin @drawandstrike Yes he did.. What's your point.. mine is If you encourage the Bull then don't get upset when he Bucks you.
@RhondaSc123 Lady I'm not talking about You Per say😶😶😶😶 Not Talking your half sister who has a cousin married to a Black guy whom Exonerates Your Whole Family from being Racist. Not talking about Y'all. Neo-Nazi's marching into Charlottesville Screaming their Support for Donald. Sheesh😶
@RhondaSc123 Oh..I have family members that are Jews so i can't be Anti-Semiotic is the Dumbest Logic of all time. I'm not Calling Trump Anti-Semitic if you pull out of his Backside for a minute you can Understand that. I spoke on his Pandering to a Racist Base who believe they are empowered
@RhondaSc123 Well again Let Me Slow it down So you can Read it Slowly. If he cares about * Jews👈As you put it ( Jewish😶) People. Then it may not be a Good Idea to encourage NEO NAZI'S by calling them " Very Fine People" it's not Rocket Science
Well as you see Republicans are just Talking Politics. They don't care about Dead Jewish People and Mass Shootings. They care about Winning Elections. I presented with facts about Their God in Chief. And they just simply changed the Subject to one they can win. https://t.co/hRiIgID0Ny
@RhondaSc123 Well as you see Republicans are just Talking Politics. They don't care about Dead Jewish People and Mass Shootings. They care about Winning Elections. I presented with facts about Their God in Chief. And they just simply changed the Subject to one they can win.
@NanaUbiz @drawandstrike Yep.. Is that your final answer?
@chuckwoolery @LmssearsLarry How about you let the Courts handle it big guy. You worry about your own job. After all those burgers aren't going to flip themselves.
@drawandstrike And to stop calling Neo Nazi's "Very Fine People" oh and To Stop Sterio-typing Migrants. Oh and Stop Dictating That Black NFL players lose the Right to Their Persuit of Happiness if they don't Obey Him. Oh and Stop attacking Barrack Obama. It not a good look
@marcorubio @alistairpge Can you blame them. Trump said with his own Mouth. Not yours Not mine.. His Own mouth. About Anti-Semitic Organizations Like Neo Nazi's. That They Were Very Fine People. 👈👈Did he say that or was that his Evil Twin?
@JoShawTx @AprilJkcorp That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
@RolloofRosslyn @ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike To get to the level of OG you have to kill lot's of people😅😅. No you don't. And what have to do with my statement? Most if not All Mass Shooters Are White. Fact.               So.  na-nanny Boo Boo😝
@The_RandomGary @Trillfact @JackPosobiec @BarackObama Lol.. You wouldn't make it home
@The_RandomGary @Trillfact @JackPosobiec @BarackObama Ummmm Capitalization would not Be on a IQ test😶😶😶😶 The ability to follow a Conversation would be.
@realDonaldTrump @SaraCarterDC Well There are " Very Fine People " on Both Sides of Anti-Semitism
@ABPatriotWriter @alistairpge @drawandstrike Well we see it like this. Most Mass Shooters Are White. Now how he/she votes is not important.
@RealCandaceO @Steve73058868 Lady tone it down. I'm no Al Sharpton Fan but He hasn't destroyed no communities. Ain't no Plantations around here. We just Put a Black Man in the Whitehouse. Just the pure Symbolism in that proves how far we've come. Now if we can Get White people to stop trying to destroy that.
RT @TDPattillo: What I’m hearing from Trump is that if we’ll all just be nicer to him his supporters will stop killing us.

@labeling66 @DiamondandSilk Why the hell do white people keep trying to blame Slavery on Democrats or Republicans. So? How is that relevant?
@Shiningtheligh1 @DiamondandSilk I said and I Quote- NAME ME ONE HISTORIC LEGISLATION DONALD HAS PASSED THAT I CAN COMPARE TO A CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION" You know before i Crown him the second coming of Dr MLK.
@doreenb8 @DiamondandSilk @realScottWagner Look fool... I got everything to lose. Why that little insult goes over most people's head. I caught it. See we aren't as underprivileged as you make us out to be. We have achieved alot in the in the last 70yrs on own accord. Not on Dem or Rep platforms but on Racial Justice
@realDonaldTrump Did you hire any of these fine young Conservatives to work in the West Wing along side you? See my momma use to say. You can fool some of the people Some of the time but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.
@CDP53VA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You couldn't imagine it?????????	Well u must be an illegal Alien and Only have been in this country 700 days. 8yrs prior to that. There was a President who was disrespected on every level. This dude claimed the man was born im Kenya😅. Just because he was Black.
@DiamondandSilk Ummm what's the Relevance to Civil Rights laws and Trump?
@DiamondandSilk @realScottWagner You don't even live in that state? So how do you know their needs? Just Vote Republican blindly. Their all great people right? Gtfoh

@Mimi_Moonbeam @4everdeplorable @DiamondandSilk First off.. I suppose Leftist can be " Quit Racist " to White Americans. But to African Americans White People cam be "Quit Racist".

@e39977hdj @TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch We know you hated Obama	, We don't know why. You say a lot of stuff. But it's BS. He did a damn good job	 Feckles?

@DailyCaller See I know what's going on. Conspiracy and Squares who have never dealt with cops. Look from experience,if a detective ask you a question about a crime that you didn't commit. And You lie. From EXPERIENCE. If you lie. you 	 draw his Suspension. So Don't ever think you Don Jr

And bubbles and All time low and 9.00 a gallon. I was here buddy. And all your saying is Donald Trump is the best. Ok.
@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump @TomFitton I still say you can't target someone that isn't doing nothing. I can arrest you for Receiving Stolen merchandise unless you are dumb enough to receive it.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Correction: The American " White People " want border security. That's not an issue in other communities. African Americans are more concerned with Higher Wages minimum wage increase prison reform. We don't really want all these immigrant Jobs. Can really get ahead like that.
@IngrahamAngle So that's what's been going on in Washington.. Everybody Buzzing
@RealOmarNavarro @Trumpgirl401 Do you have any oratorical ability? See people will pay to hear you speak. Prepare a good message and deliver a good speech. But other then that, your President has minimum wage@7.55  So though there are a lot of jobs they all pay 7.55 that don't leave nothing for donations.
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs See that's a True White Boy for you.	Trump only surprises People that don't know any White Boys.	If I had to pick a example of someone that's exhibits every characteristic of what it is to be and think White. It would be Donald Trump. He's the Protype for everything that Are.
@thehill @SHominiuk I Don't have to Respect nothing Tiger. Respect is earned and so are ass whoopings if I People don't know they place. Trump is a man like me. And in real life, the way he talk would have been got him punched messing with me. I Don't play that. And that goes form Trump to Jesus

@e39977hdj @TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch You don't have " Proof " of that. you don't even have an admission from Hillary.

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @SaraCarterDC @JudicialWatch Yall could get my brother out. He got caught with 9kilos but it was a set up.

@DailyCaller Buzz feed isn't the most trusted news agency. But let's say Trump Sr didnt know. So.. Jr is still an idiot for attending a meeting and act like it was for puppies. You should be banned from politics.
@e39977hdj @TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch But Blaming other People for Mistakes made by Your Favorite Guy is Not Collusion it's Negative Reinforcement. If the FBI is Corrupt Should Choppo Guzmon start preparing his Appeal? That's Corruption at The Top. That's Seem Good Enough To Queston Every Federal Case
@e39977hdj @TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch If Dems wanted to destroy your way of living They were in power for 8yrs? They've has plenty opportunity. You are making excuses for Trump and his Family because of White Privilege. It's easy. Just tell him that if a foreign power contact you with Hacked Info. Call the FBI
@e39977hdj @TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch I Understand you are a Rep hardcore Constitutional enforcer. But OUR CIA and FBI  say not to mention it was Obvious That our elections were attacked  whether DT had something to do with it is immaterial. He'll be fine, His biggest problem is his mouth. If he's not guilty then ok.
@e39977hdj @TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch You sound paranoid. You treat fellow Americans like Foreign powers and treat Foreign Powers like fellow Americans., I understand the philosophical difference between Our to parties but it not Bloods&amp;Crips. We are on the same team. LOOK the FBI has kept us safe all of my 41yrs
@FoxNews Trump has secret service You don't 	He can kill political correctness all he wants. But some of tha stuff he say are fighting words i real life. So Don't let Trump get yo ass whooped. And it's not a Lib or Con issue. A ass whooping is Bi Partisan.
@JackPosobiec No I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. I'll pass it on😂
@FoxNews @dbongino @foxandfriends Shit..its been ugly for the last 2
@TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Now common sense. How I set you up to have you meet with Russian? What I got mind control? How I  make you lie about it?😐 How the FBI get you to implicate yourself on Twitter, And fall all over Putin? That's a hell of a set up😐. Seem to me he was a willing participant.
@TomFitton @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Thank you Micheal Western but I'm going to go with the professionals, not some half wit Scooby Doo Detective.
@GOPChairwoman @DavidDa45021395 @realDonaldTrump What your portfolio look like,?. You in the millions yet? That Nasdaq got you shopping for a New Volts Wagon? Girl bye.. The only thing you can do is quite one 7.55 job and get another one right way..
@FLOTUS @DavidDa45021395 @POTUS @UKenyatta @WhiteHouse We can tell
@FoxNews Man holler at us when it's done we don't need updates.
@ChuckGrassley @pdpfacc So..
@ida_skibenes You are to envolved😐 why would you orgasm? He's just some spoiled rich kid going to jail for telling the dumbest lie of all time to the FBI😐
@KMAC19691 @NatashaBertrand The same way I feel when they do it everyday. Apparently it wasn't all for nothing. If I'm selling dope and the cops run in my trap. How do You feel? Because I'm going to let you talk to them and make this same case for me. I thought BlueLivesMatter? Criminals go to jail
" Fake News. " is a childish and ridiculous phrase. Those that use it don't have the Mental Fortitude to articulate words like " Fictional  News " imaginary News " or the wit and cynical ability to say " Alternative News " They say " Fake News " like a 7yr old.
RT @yashar: Arizona’s senior senator just passed away due to brain cancer and a candidate for Senate in Arizona just tweeted this... https:…

@darstin1957 @toolfool @atensnut @lsferguson @donnabrazile Shit if he worshiped devil the Trump needs  to try it. He old pervert. Character establish God and the Devil. Dude dedicated his book to the devil. That probably had to be the only one who got it because iv never heard of him
@darstin1957 @toolfool @atensnut @lsferguson @donnabrazile So.. LOOK I'm only grading Presidents on Policies and Performance. He can be a member of The 7 dwarfs. That's irrelevant. I had no plans on worshipping Obama. He got us out a financial crisis. Tried to do the right thing with healthcare. And was a good dad and husband.
@NPR U
Hey Twitter admins. Blow me
@RobBadgley @atensnut @donnabrazile You are a disrespectful twat
@toolfool @atensnut @lsferguson @donnabrazile Get off Obama's Jock. Why does every critique of Dennis The Menace In the Oval office require us to ask." What would Obama Do?" Obama isnt Jesus. But I guarantee that our next President won't be asking what Trump would do?
@WhiteHouse Congrats Asshole.
@toddstarnes @Liz_Wheeler @realDonaldTrump Well you know. You get what you give. Who are you to question that man's karma. Worry about the Economy isn't that Your Big Deal.

@NyyChamps2018 @kayleighmcenany @GOP @realDonaldTrump Where we going?
Dear Trump.	It's easy for the Governor of Florida to be tuff on Borders. He doesn't have any. Unless he's deport fish that swim from Mexico.
@realDonaldTrump @AjmanosGravel What border Is in Florida? Is deporting fish?
@AndrewFeinberg @gonkresists @realDonaldTrump That's cuz Trump in urban vascular . Is a hoe Ass nigga.

@marklutchman @TexiansRbest It's called a Remote😐
@KMAC19691 @NatashaBertrand Hey tell that to thousands of Drug dealers in the joint. That got raided at midnight. And if you read what the convictions. They did NOT pay their Taxes. But they rode down Streets that I pay for! No one is above the law because they know the president.
@JohnCooper0610 @JoanneW2017 What are you Voting for? He's never won the popular Vote. He's never going to win the popular Vote. Most people don't like him. Hes to disrespectful to like. If he was a regular guy he would have been beat up. Do you how electoral college works. That what you need to focus on.
@JasonGamache13 Yep.. we have been telling yall that for some time. We got problems.

@tombrokaw @MarkJam92731126 That isn t his house or flag. Why does someone just go there and do it. What's he going to do? He can't fight.
@jbv0328 @FoxNews @AjmanosGravel Again you are prescribing things to me that don't fit. Deflection	I feel great. I live in a very diverse modern city. 	Houston!!!!!
@JackPosobiec I'm not Elite. And I kneel until we get police reform. Trump hollering at us like we his children or some slaves. To me he a ignorant white boy , and I wish he Come make us stand up. Yea it's easy to do all that barking with secret service around you. Phunk
@jbv0328 @FoxNews @AjmanosGravel I Don't have a agenda.. why would I need one? I've never in 23yrs of Voting showed up to find out some immigrant used up my Vote. And I'm scared as shit of all Colors of people equally.  		No I twisted your words to fit your agenda.
@Education4Libs @Mary95437125 The man is dead. Do you have any respect. Damn! Same People Bashing John McCain on his death bed. Are the same ones Screaming at NFL player about respecting the Veterans
@BillyBaldwin @jenwazy You are right.. I can't 	However I found a picture of him in Helsinki giving Vladimir Putin a Hand-Job
@GOP @kobiashimarro @realDonaldTrump He needs to deliver more then 7.55 an hour or he can do those immigrant jobs his self.
@kelliwardaz @badboy129 @realDonaldTrump We are just following the lead of our commander and chief mam #Salute
@bigmoose1936 @kayleighmcenany @GOP @realDonaldTrump How.. They don't like those dude's. Mexican President never did anything for Mexican people. That why they leave.
@JohnRD21807388 @NsanecreativiT @Nongel1Jen @Odendog You people can't be this dense😐😐😐 Have someone ever voted in your name? Then what are you talking about?
@Blazenhozen @Nongel1Jen @Odendog What?? 🙁 Nevermind, 	Just go Vote..		😔Lord YouTube ruined these children.
@jbv0328 @FoxNews @AjmanosGravel How many Less? Because you are taking like all you criminal are Mexicans😐 and you just have tiny winny mental health problems. See I  take a statics class. So I actually know what percentage of your crime is committed by immigrants.
@thisiskirt @GreenDiplomacy @JoanneW2017 @HillaryClinton @DNC @TheJusticeDept @FBI Oh..
@Blazenhozen @Nongel1Jen @Odendog I Don't.. we already show ID in the city. Us people that live in places were education is available and were we don't still drive wagon trains and churn butter. Have had to get our Voters registration card with our ID. Where do you live? Bedrock?
@kayleighmcenany @GOP @realDonaldTrump Good .We want To trade Trump for 100 bottles of Tequila. 25 cases of Avocados. And lots of that Mexican candy.
@tedcruz @badboy129 Yea..but only thats irrelevant to why people don't stand. It's like you are attempting to change the subject for lack of a decent argument. I've voting the other way this time Ted. You are trying to pull a Donald and Confuse the issues. Only your base is not that dumb.
@immyonefwend @WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump You are calling the News Fake. Like their doing Casting Calls,  Staring Sylvester Stallone. Is White House on a Hollywood  Movie Set? Calm down. Read Books. Not the interne .But real Books. The older the better It'll break the speak the spell of all this new Speak and distrust
@immyonefwend @WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump But im not repeating Librals. You are Repeating People. That's a simple sign of being under a spell.
@Sunrise51052 @badboy129 So..buy your own funeral and invite who you like. You don't know why he made that choice. Maybe he didn't want to turn it into a circus. Maybe he knew like we all know to well that Trump will tell a Dry Lie like. " When I walked in I said John and He almost opened his eyes "
@NsanecreativiT @Nongel1Jen @Odendog Nope. You have to legalize and have an invested interest in a State
@immyonefwend @WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump " Fake News Media"😐did you come up with that? Again Repeating people. Have you ever read 1984? You need to. It's like you've been hypnotized. Like Trump has your Soul. Hey Snap out of it. He is Not a Great Man. He's just some Millionaire that's use to getting what he wants.
@TaxReformExpert @JoanneW2017 Are those three guys only Immigrants you know?😐😐 I bet you are from a state that don't even border Mexico🤣I've been in Texas my entire life and I know lots and lots of undocumented immigrants. That dont look like that. You just don't like Mexicans
@Education4Libs @shepherdsherrye Boy You Don't know Mollie Tabbet. You just don't like Mexicans. One Immigrant kills one person and it was a shame. 4days later a legal Immigrant kills a Room full of people. Killing isn't a Residential status. Immigrants are not killing  Hundreds by the day. You are exaggerating
@FoxNews @AjmanosGravel Could cost lives? Don't you think that's a little dramatic. An illegal killed on girl last week. This week a White Dude unload a Gun in a Madden tournament killing lots of people. Fox News should lose its license to Report news
@SheriffClarke @shepherdsherrye @realDonaldTrump The only Wall Trump is getting comes with bars and a jump suit.
@immyonefwend @WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump Stop repeating people it not cute. And it show a lack of self esteem. No one can be smart for you. You don't know what Hillary Did. You assume based on Clues you found on Twitter. However what I can prove she's done First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State.That's 24yrs of service
@immyonefwend @WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump Says who. You are God? Because I think she can be whatever she puts her mind too. Now What's your Title?
@NonTypeA @WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump You are right, Screech from saved by the bell would get my vote over this bafoon.
@NatashaBertrand Trump and all these guys have never paid taxes. But they cry about people get food assistance that have been paying into the system for yrs. What's that called?
@FoxNews @PatriciaSCrens1 @RealCandaceO Library mean Bondage.	What??
RT @ScottFrazier19: If you’re so offended by seeing football players kneeling during the national anthem, then you could always just ignore…
@WhiteHouse @Italians4Trump The only Trade I wanna hear about is Trading Trump for Hillary.
Good luck buying some Stocks making 7,55 an hour😐
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka So.. I Don't have no stocks, can't buy stocks making 7.55hr.
@cindy_uzzell @LouDobbs @POTUS It's was because of color. Tribes conquere tribes. Bed the Women, Kill the children ,enslave the men. That has nothing to do with race. That's WARFARE. Indians Didn't Enslave Other Indians because they were a little lighter complexion. That idea came from White People
@cindy_uzzell @LouDobbs @POTUS Let me ask you this. If I walked up to you and said " You I owned all pacaso painting first. Then I sold them to the museum " 	Am I fit to babysit your children even though you making big money at work? No, why? Because I'm going to teach your kid how to never tell the truth.
@cindy_uzzell @LouDobbs @POTUS Almost all White People are racist. Including Hillary and Trump.
@thisiskirt @GreenDiplomacy @JoanneW2017 @HillaryClinton @DNC @TheJusticeDept @FBI Boy bye.. Yall got the emails.  They were read, your POTUS claim only 1% were read claim they skim through them. So way doesn't he get in his dad's car and drive down to the DOJ and Read them his self? Hot Air
@Type_ur_name @Nongel1Jen @Odendog Now it's " Maybe Voting Illegally ".. You don't Vote. Know how I can tell? Can't vote without Registering, can't Register With ID can't get an ID without a birth certificate.. Not worth the Trouble. Plus America's don't even Vote. Illegal Immigrants Don't care about Voting
@DFBHarvard @raslady1 Ok	.You are taking Dick Riding to another level.
@FREEKORANISBURN @nlrauls Mom wants to know if you are going to work today or are u just going to play on Twitter? She said she wants her 50.00 she loaned you to get your tv out the pawn!!!
@BlueSea1964 @raslady1 So.. That's their money, We just are going take it back down.
@LauraLoomer @MicheleScopes @MSNBC @MalcolmNance They have the courage. I Don't think they have the  medical staff to deal with your disability tho.
@cindy_uzzell @LouDobbs @POTUS "Made to heel??"😐 where are you from? 1816? 	What are you talking about? Hillary lies she human. I lie, You lie, everyone tell a Lie here and There. But Trump lies about what he ate today.  And Crowd sizes, And shit I can see. That's another level of Lying.
@Nevrdemagain @ClintEastwoodLA @raslady1 Oooo big difference 🤣🤣

@Nongel1Jen @Odendog You are dumb as a Bowl of Rice.	And I can't tell you don't vote by this comment. Tell you was, during the primaries go to your polling station and snap me a picture of all these illegal immigrants. Stupid as country bumkin
@55true4u @kobiashimarro Why didn't you just go to school finish and join the CIA? By now you would know all about the whole building. You would have your own locker
@ErikaMcdougall @raslady1 @FoxNews @marklevinshow @RealCandaceO Truth and Trump would be impressive to see for once. If he stops telling corny lies we would believe him more often
@GinnyCotton13 @kobiashimarro How many illegal immigrants do you know. Just the 5 in the picture? 		And  why do people that live in State's like Iowa always worried about immigration? There no foreign country bordering Iowa. I like in Texas and Immigrants don't both me. Lol. Xenophobia 🤣🤣
@starcrosswolf @Odendog @AppSame @Trump454545 @GartrellLinda @DonnaWR8 @sxdoc @KNP2BP @pinkk9lover @FriendlyJMC @LVNancy @Ladies4Trump20 Well leave people alone and stop acting like it if you don't want to be called it.
@Anon_decoder @kobiashimarro Man leave people alone before you get beat up. You can't barely pay your car note. But you all in other people's business. Get your ass to work. Them burgers aren't going to flip themselves.

@Fresh_Awake78 @lcook74 @HillaryClinton Mueller investigation can end right now.The mission wasn't to get Your Precious God Stupid. It was to find out where he was getting his information stupid. Problem is as we were investing the Russian he started Lying about Corny shit that people with common sense don't lie about
@PowerGirlTweets @DankoRobin @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @VP Yet here you are on Twitter😐😐😐😐
@codeofvets @kobiashimarro Hey goofball that's not a conspiracy. There is No Organization dedicated to doing that. Those are PERSONAL DECISIONS 🤣🤣 I think people are going to do what they want to their bodies. After all IT'S THEIRS😐 But carry on.
@GreenDiplomacy @JoanneW2017 @HillaryClinton @DNC @TheJusticeDept @FBI But he's the one that said if he loses he won't concede? If she had him investigated it was because His dumb ass is up on stage hollering about emails and other classified information that no private citizen should have on the Security of State.
@LauraLoomer @INVUQT #1 Stop saying "Fake News" it's a Stupid phrase. And it makes it seem like we live in that book 1984	#2 Unless you knew John McCain Personally. Been to his house, sat down and had dinners with him.then you are " Fake News" some chick with a opinon on the internet.
@CSnow51 @INVUQT So let me get this right. 	Now the DOJ is corrupt?	So that makes	The DOJ	The FBI	The CIA	The state dept	Every Media Outlet except for FOX	Congressional Democrats 	That's literally everyone🤔 	The only one not Corrupt is Donald?😐😂✌

@RL9631 @DavidDa45021395 Bannon the CIA director signs visas? All of them? How many Visas are in this country, sounds like that job should keep him plenty busy.
@claesbart @INVUQT Well what's good for the Goose is good for the Gander.
@LouDobbs @cindy_uzzell @POTUS Did he write that? Yea? Well I don't believe it. Problem is I've caught him in too many lies about small things. I Don't dislike the guy. But he lies too much
@realDonaldTrump @shepherdsherrye Donald 96% of your problem is your big mouth. Not the madia, the " Fake News"( as you say). Are just the ones holding the Mic. It's not their fault You keep Lying on camera. You act like a spoiled little kid and I'm tired of the drama	 I don't care how Good the Economy is.
@LouDobbs @POTUS Give Obama a lap dance 	How did he politicize the DOJ since the day he was elect? By being Black? That's the only thing prevalent since his inauguration.  You made that he spied on Trump and found a criminal.
@RudyGiuliani Now that's the Rudy I know.
@wesnamanda @naya1954 @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Who is your party? Can't be the same party of Rush Limbaugh who hoped Obama would fail 	It can't be the same party of Donald Trump who went looking for the man's birth certificate 😐	Can't be the same party of republicans that blocked him out by saying NO and shutting down?
