We are a great nation.  This is a speech and a fight that honors our ideals.  Lets embrace this fight.
This 12 year time horizon is interesting.  @ezraklein will tell us budgets usually go 10.
"reduce spending in the tax code"  i love it.  i prefer "fairness" but i quibble.
Funny thing.  Ryan agrees that the health care act saves big bucks.
Savings in defense? Is that possible?  Dont we need to buy some F20s or something?
why im not president.  my version : "the gop plan is a disaster and ill chew my arm off before i sign it"
Almost jarring to hear an adult description of these problems.  Fox is getting ready to cut away to a car chase. #OrAGoldLineAd
Most of the money we borrow is from the Social Security Trust Fund btw.  Not china.
Somewhere Joe Wilson is yelling "You Lie!" over and over at his TV.  President is doing great setting the debate.
A long overdue explanation of why government exists.  Why Americans are Progressives.
Nobody chooses to be sick.  "free market solutions" dont fly when your child has asthma.
Jack Lew was Bar Mitzvahed in Forest Hils.  #OfftoaSlowStart
Curious thing about Ryan proposals.  They ignore a basic truth.  Smaller buying pools lead to higher prices.  Econ 101.
Potus will say Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit.  That is a fact.  #ThusBachmannWillGetItWrong
Health care for the poor gets paid for one of 2 ways : efficiently or inefficiently.  Slashing Medicaid only moves the cost.
Keep this in mind about Medicare: Obamacare reduced costs and extended the life of the program.  #GopHasLiedEveryDayAboutThis
Lets review the bidding : Democrats proposed and created Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid.  #GOPstillHatesEach
I'm gonna livetweet during the President's budget remarks at 1:30 #OtherOptionIsTalkingBackToMyTV

$4.4 trillion in cuts by GOP in '12 budget.  Only $78b in DoD.  Help me here.  What % is that?
The GOP "12 budget is essentially a cost shifting shell game.  Cost of health care moved to states and citizens. #enoughryanadulation
