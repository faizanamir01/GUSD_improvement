Only Donald Trump would say that he could pardon himself from a judicial investigation. Screw the constitution, separation of powers and checks and balances. If you as an American back him up on this, you are part of the problem
You fired James Comey because he wouldn’t pledge his loyalty. You’re not fooling anyone. We didn’t need him to figure out Russian meeting wasn’t about adoptions or your “illegal” wiretap allegations were fake news. Let mueller do his Job, or do you have something to hide
✅Trump campaign director—INDICTED	✅Trump NSA—PLEA	✅Trump deputy campaign director—PLEA	✅Trump campaign advisor—PLEA 	✅Lawyer to campaign advisor—PLEA	✅Trump deputy campaign director—PLEA	✅13 Kremlin conspirators—INDICTED	✅Trump personal lawyer—under federal investigation
Justice department investigated Benghazi for 4 years and zero indictments. Investigated Hillary Clinton’s emails for 2 years and zero indictments. In the first 14 months of the Mueller investigation there have been 23 indictments and 5 plea-deals
Donald Trump’s partisan attacks on Robert Mueller are ludicrous. Mueller is a registered Republican, appointed by a Republican and was nominated by Republicans. He is widely respected on both sides of the aisle as being non-partisan. There would be no cause in any firing
