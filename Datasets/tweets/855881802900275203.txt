No matter how much you hate School,	You'll gonna miss it when you leave it :)
It kills when you miss someone a lot and they are busy enjoying their life having no idea about it :(
Everyone is busy with their loved one,	And I am busy scrolling my News Feed..
I love chatting with those people who don't stop chatting even after saying bye.. &lt;3
My phone has thousand of songs,	But I listen to same 7-8 songs on repeat all the time :D
There is always a third Person in a Relationship who is waiting for breakup 😂
Silent Boy + Talkative Girl	Makes the Best Pair &lt;3
I hate when I am waiting for a text from you and then my phone vibrate but that message is not from you :/
Enjoy every moment of your life,	You never know when these moments turn to memories :)
I wish my Parents could live forever 😍
Don't be so quick to believe what you hear,	Because lies spread quicker than the truth :)
Don't force someone to make time for you,	If they really want to, They will :)
18 to 30 is the age where we meet a lot of temporary People :)
Truth:	People will hurt you and then they act like you hurt them 🤗
People before knowing me:	OMG! Why are you so quiet?	.	People after knowing me:	Will you please Shut Up! 	😂😂
No one cares unless you are Rich, Beautiful or Dead :/
Always remember:	Beauty attracts heart,	But character attracts soul :)
People always remember your mistakes,	But no one remembers the good things you have done to them :)
3 Mistakes of my Life:	.	1) I trust easily.	2) I care for everyone.	3) I don't cheat.
At first I was so innocent &amp; good boy,	Then my Idiot best friend entered in my life and everything changed :D
Don't believe those who tell you they love you,	Believe those who show you that they love you :)
Being a girl is not easy in our Society,	Can't walk out at Night,	Can't talk to any Male Friend,	Can't do what your dream is :/
Every Girl have that one male friend with whom She shares all her feelings without any fear :)
I wish we could talk again like we used to be before :(
Raise your hand if you haven't smoked in your whole life (y)
Raise your hand if you love to travel in night time &lt;3
No matter how busy a Person is,	If they really care, they will always find time for you :)
I don't respect those who don't respect me..	Some people call it Ego,	But I call it Self Respect :)
Know yourself first before judging others :)
I seriously need a break from my current life :(
If you want a long term Relationship,	Follow the simple rule: "Never Lie" :)
You are lucky if you found a Person who never gets tired of understanding your nonsense attitude 😍
Not every Girl wants money,	Some just want your Time, Attention and Love..
One day you will search me to say Sorry,	But that will be too late 😰😜
When no one is there,	Music will always be there for you 😍
When couple fight so much and they are not breaking up, They are really in Love
If She ignores you for a Day,	Ignore her for a Week 😏
It's better to wait long..	Then to Marry wrong 😞
Did you know?	Girls usually fall in love with funny boys :)
If you want to be happy then never expect anything from anyone :)
