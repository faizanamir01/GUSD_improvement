3. U may think I am wrong but until the Kurds become as one nation one vote in Turkey it will make it so much harder to get our own state
2. In the pass the turkish state as killed so many Kurds ppl some family have never been able to bury the love ones in the name we should be as one not having party against each other

So are you saying that our mother daughter's sisters should just allow the Islamic State come into our homes kill rape murder and abuse us and we don't have the right to fight back then you are the mad one
@RT_Erdogan why didn't Nato bomb or send any troops into #Afrin or state on world media that the was a problem with terriost or Islamic State because @AfrinsNotAlone played no part of the war and ppl the lived in peace
