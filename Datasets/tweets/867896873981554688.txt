Maroon 5 is white male mediocrity as a band.
To be clear, spay/neuter has behavioral, medical, and societal benefits but forcing it on people with the threat of a hefty bill or jail time is so inappropriate.
Punishing those who don’t want their dogs spayed/neutered with a $500 fee will no doubt increase the numbers of pit bulls in the shelter system.
Encouraging spay/neuter participation through incentives, such as low-cost vet care, and education is a harm-free way to achieve this goal.
Attempting to reduce the number of pit bulls in shelters is fantastic, but making pit bull ownership more onerous and expensive is not the way to do it. https://t.co/o6B89eEH4K

With the changing attitudes toward dog adoption and the fact that a majority of dogs found in shelters are “pit bull type dogs,” more young people are owning these dogs. And deciding where to move and settle down.
As cities work tirelessly to attract the “creative class” I’m shocked that dog ownership, and the restriction of such, hasn’t been re-examined in more urban landscapes.
Do communities with breed-specific laws realize the economic consequences of banning such a popular dog population? As pit bull type dogs gain popularity w young professionals w college degrees, how many cities are losing out because those people choose to move to other cities?
