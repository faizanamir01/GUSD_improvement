@SeldenGADawgs They have NC State at Syracuse. The Orange should win that. NC ST will be down after the drubbing they got last week.
@SeldenGADawgs Happy for ya sister
@SeldenGADawgs Yes. If you have the right athletes it can work but neither Navy or Ga Tech has the needed athletes. ND does not put up a lot of points. Just don’t think they’ll cover the 22pt spread. ND will win tho. Syracuse may trip them up. The Orange are a good team.
@SeldenGADawgs 2nd best ACC team is Boston College. That runnng back is a beast.
@SeldenGADawgs ND favored by 22. Doubt they’ll cover that.
@SeldenGADawgs Ha
@SeldenGADawgs Weak schedule. Haven’t seen tough D or tough envirornment. I hate giving Saben two weeks to prepare but I think LSU should take ‘em.

@TinaMelquist @SenFeinstein Ok. Count.... so illegal immigrants that don’t pay taxes count, really???  In what world do u live?  California is a fiscal disaster. California has a lot to give but you’re governed by a satellite and major cities are woefully governed by boobs.
@TinaMelquist @SenFeinstein You know full well that @SenFeinstein is pining for illegals to vote.... which is disgusting and illegal. You need to read The Constitution and realize we live in a sovereign country with borders. There is nothing wrong with protecting our borders.
@TinaMelquist @SenFeinstein Ok. I don’t care. If you are here ILLEGALLY (not paying taxes) I’m done with you. It is that simple.
@TinaMelquist @SenFeinstein “Legally or Not” just disqualified you for “participating” in this discussion. So...  you still don’t get it.
@DLoesch Not to worry Dana. I know you are armed and I will stand with you (armed as well) and will give my life for your right to speak the truth. How many of these #leftists are willing to give theirs?  Just asking.

@realDonaldTrump please keep your full support behind #Kavanaugh. He is a great man and wonderful judge. We CAN get thru this. If he is confirmed the republicans will pick up seats in the #Senate and hold the #house. We got this!!!!!
And these people are the same ones calling #Kavanagh EVIL. These people are shameless and their actions are shameful. (A little grammar lesson for those that don’t know the difference between shameless and shameful). https://t.co/UlZEK0JrE7

@LIJOMS Terrifying yet not surprising.
Who Kept Putting Strzok in Charge? https://t.co/cvHfCt51sP. This article sums it up. We, the voter, have suspected dirty play by the #left for ages and now it is out in the open. Yet the #media ignore what is obvious.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Bwahhah. The queen of what??Seriously!!! If you want to bow down to a person (i.e. a human being)? be my guest but I bow to no one. And neither should my president @realDonaldTrump. FYI... we won The Revolutionary War to free ourselves. U may want 2 read.
@Brad_S_Brewer @gopoundsand1234 Not for nothin’. But Hell yeah!!! @realDonaldTrump looks great and #Churchill would have approved. Let’s be CLEAR.... the true Brits do NOT follow orthodoxy of the #left. #Brexit is a perfect example. Brits know they shouldn’t be controlled by #Belgium. Get it?
@mike4882_h Here’s the deal.. of late, it’s all about  #misogyny in the media’s eye. But when it comes down to it..... it is all about #misanthropy. The media elite and the elite politicians just hate people.

@realDonaldTrump   Just praying for you and your staff. It’s almost 11PM in North Carolina. I am 50 years old. Was pretty young during the #Reagan years. My dad has passed but I must say that my excitement and enthusiasm for u reminds me of his 4 Reagan.
@PressSec (2 of 2)  Ladies like you are wonderful to watch. Strong, determined and unflappable..... not a victim. Your God given talents show every day and I love watching you. Nobody can do what you do as well as you.
@PressSec So proud of you. Your dad raised a wonderful daughter. Most of all you have become a strong lady worthy of much praise. Such a shame the #feminists and the #left don’t appreciate you. You remind me of my wife. (1 of 2)
Donald Trump sparks fury posing arrogantly in Winston Churchill's armchair https://t.co/xEwaz932jx. Hello!! Trump is effing with you! And #winning. So much fun to watch. Keep going @realDonaldTrump. We love you. The #left still don’t get it. God bless @realDonaldTrump

@charliekirk11 @BossSquirrel72 Love me some @realDonaldTrump. The most intuitive man to hold the job. The #msm don’t know how to take him. The #left doesn’t understand his fans. And his voters appreciate his candor. Moreover, his voters love when #Trump trolls the left. Count me as a fan.
