@cvpayne That being said, we need some mechanism to level the playing field against foreign companies who do not play by the rules.  Tariffs are a temp measure to give advantage to locals.  Other countries use tariffs against us, this may encourage them to drop their own tariffs.
@cvpayne IF they are temporary, I agree with them.  Long term tariffs are destructive to the host economy.   I think POTUS is trying to punish those who have been abusing us for years. I taught English to Samsung execs in SK.  They admitted they used Clark to get around antidumping laws.
@cvpayne Tariffs have no place in the free market.  I think these are temporary and are attempting to undo idiotic and corrupt practices of the last 20 yrs.

In the telephone conversation with Keyes (a conversation he recorded on a state phone) I stated that what I was doing was legal.  Keyes responded, "I don't care, I will bury you!"  The tone of his voice was trembling.  He sounded like a very dangerous person. Get the recording.
but is clearly within my 1st Amendment rights.  Meaning that when Rusty tried to threaten/intimidate me into removing the account both him and Eddie Holloway commited felony Conspiracy Against Rights 18 U.S.C. § 241.  Will your office prosecute them?
I called FC DA's office and left a detailed message, they did not respond.  I called Pearl River County DA's office and halfway through call, he said, "I will get in trouble if I continue this call."  Creation of parody twitter accounts is not only within the rules of twitter
FBI said to report incident to local authorities.  I filed a report with Pear River County Sheriff's Office.  I also called the Office of Minimum Standards who stated that they would launch an investigaion if the university president made a request.

@AGJimHood As part of my plea, designed by Eddie Holloway, I was to complete 3 mths inpatient treatment for OCD, depression, alcoholism and anger management.  I’ve done so but they have marked me w/ a felony making it near impossible to find employment. This from a university.1/2
@AGJimHood In my case #USM @SouthernMissPD started with a situation that wasn’t even grounds for expulsion from school and turned it into 3 felonies.  I begged them to de-escalate.  They just ignored me and allowed me to sink deeper into anger and rage.
@FedUpwith50th As long as thugs like Eddie Holloway are in leadership, #MS education is doomed.  The guy charged me with cyberstalking then called me 4 times after I plead to “Posting of Injurious Messages”. He claims the calls were accidental.  Think about that for a minute.

@GodandtheBear We are lucky to live in this age.  It can be done relatively cheap.  But that is organizing like minded.  I was talking about changing minds then organizing.  To change a mind is extremely expensive in 2017.  You are battling so many other interests.
@GodandtheBear It takes a lot of $ to get a large group together for any cause.
@GodandtheBear Politics affects everyone but not everyone pays attention to politics.   They take it for granted and simply trust and assume everyone in power is worth trusting so there is no need to spend energy watching their every move.
@GodandtheBear Me too!  That would be paradise but we are very far removed from that now.
@GodandtheBear I have a brother who spends 100% of his non-essential brain power thinking about sports.  I’m sure he’s not the only one.
@GodandtheBear Well for one I’m talking about this.  Can you honestly say that 100% of the population spends any amount of time discussing politics?
@GodandtheBear I hear you.  I don’t want anyone controlling me either,   if you don’t you have to be involved in whatever political system you find yourself otherwise you’re willing to be ruled by your lessers.
@GodandtheBear I don’t.  But for the crowd to rule the crowd must be informed to a point that is unrealistic at this time.
@GodandtheBear Good point.  I think the brain was the same but since there was no writing and storing of information for extended periods most time was spent hunting and gathering.  Laws and social contracts are less than 20k yrs old.
@GodandtheBear Democracy is the messiest most unstable form of govt ever conceived.  Republic is much better.  But for a Republic to be effective you need an educated electorate and checks and balances.

@SouthernMiss @sunherald @campusreform @wdam BTW I was never indicted.  #USM kept me in jail for 7.5 months and was told could be held for 2 yrs w/out indictment. I plead to save my life.  I was locked up with murderers who would kill for a 1/2 pint of milk. #SMTTT #ChooseUSM #MSleg

@SouthernMissPD I know u have dirt on that rat bastard.  Be a hero.  Expose him.
@SouthernMissPD Rusty when EH told u that BS story about his phone being worked on he was insulting ur intelligence. Why ru protecting him?
@SouthernMissPD It took me less than 30 seconds to determine Holloway was a pathological liar.  By lying to u he is insulting u. #WiseUp
@SouthernMissPD Before you arrested me I told you he was s pathological liar. Now do you believe me? Or do you believe he called by accident
@SouthernMissPD Do you see a correlation in #MS being last in everything + &amp; the fact that you have leaders like Lyin' Eddie? #SMTTT #USM
