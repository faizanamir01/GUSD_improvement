@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP But the alternative is unregulated firearm transfers which is very unsafe. Yes, you and I would not transfer weapons to dangerous people, but plenty of people do. That’s where my whole issue with responsibility comes in.
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP Most of those programs already exist. They’d have to figure out how to make them more effective. Why do you find UBCs to be such a bad idea? I’ve always had a background check when I purchase firearms. I think it’s a good initial screening tool.
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP I think it would be great to keep government out as well. I see a major part of the problem as a responsibility issue. Possibly more firearm education would be helpful. I grew up shooting, but many people didn’t. More training might increase safety.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP https://t.co/Wu1t0nazIg
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP The one from 2016 has some great information and is very relevant. So how do we address the issue? That’s where I’m seeing the let down by our politicians.
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise @GOP As far as I can tell, all the @GOP does is avoid doing anything. Can you be more specific as to the cultural and socioeconomic issues that cause gun violence? Do you have any data?
@Ishootammo @SteveScalise So what is it and what is the @GOP doing to address it?

@GOPChairwoman What’s anti-Semitic about having issues with the government of Israel? It’s a fact that they (government of Israel) have denied the Palestinian citizens of their country basic civil and human rights.
@Rychkidz16 @ipersevere34 @GOP Right? We know Trump’s a liar and philanderer, but it’s not illegal unless he lies to law enforcement and/or under oath. Paying your lawyer for his services or to pay off a hooker is not a crime.

@fluff_sophie @sciblu27 @SteveScalise Many of them get them from people who purchase them legally and then sell them into the black market. Not sure why people think background checks are so intrusive. It’s really strange. If you’re a criminal, you shouldn’t have a gun.

@MoiBuenano @mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman That’s funny, I worked in the ER in Valencia and saw GSWs every single night.
@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman @MoiBuenano Well, I was there from 2009-2011 and there were a lot of guns, and not just the military. I’m muting you now, so have fun talking at no one. It’s a good fit since you don’t say anything. https://t.co/lIxXG6orYt
@MoiBuenano @mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman I lived there for 3 years (Valencia) and have many friends there who have been resisting Maduro since he seized power.
@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman They don’t have guns? 😂😂 Now I know you’ve never been to Venezuela.
@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman I read the news too. It’s better for Venezuela to do this on their own. They’re ready.
@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman Valencia
@parscale How is something that is decreasing in frequency and has been going on “for 40 years” an emergency? And no “emergency” justifies violating the Constitution.
@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman Venezuelans have been suffering and rising up against Maduro for years. Why does the US care all of a sudden? I’m all for the people getting what they want. I doubt they want a US-controlled puppet regime.
@mwil_155 @GOPChairwoman Calm down. I spent years in Venezuela. My friends are starving too. I hate Maduro. But Trump is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
@GOPChairwoman As the Trump Administration seems to think it’s their duty to pick a new leader for Venezuela, who was not elected or a true part of the resistance, and install them. Seems a lot like US action in Latin America in the 80s.
@realDonaldTrump This is some Kim Jung Un shit right here.
@NRA You mean just like illegal immigration?
@realDonaldTrump Besides the actual Constitution

@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz I appreciate that, and our earlier discussion regarding a joint CBP/DHS committee to recommend border security measures was great. However, I don’t think we need to have further discussion on how quickly I could climb over the wall.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz Likewise
@JJussely @VOTEMAGA2020 @RepMattGaetz YouTube videos don’t replace facts. You obviously can’t participate in a fact-based, intellectual conversation. Enjoy your YouTubing. Take care, I’m muting you now.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz Not too hard. I climb a lot, I’d say I can judge pretty well how long it would take to get over it.
@JJussely @VOTEMAGA2020 @RepMattGaetz You need to get over the idea that what you think is somehow reality. It’s not.
@JJussely @VOTEMAGA2020 @RepMattGaetz That’s not what’s happening. You’d be a shitty drug smuggler. The data proves it. 85% through ports of entry. People can’t carry enough to be worth it. Also, I could be over that wall in 30 seconds with a bit of climbing rope. It won’t slow down anyone determined to get in.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, we don’t have a voice. Our @POTUS decided to ignore our elected officials and our Constitution when he went around Congress to secure wall funding. That’s an autocracy and that is much more a danger to our nation than illegal immigration.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Personally, I’d recommend a joint commission, on public record, comprised of non-appointed staff including, at a minimum, 50% front-line agents with practical experience.
@parscale #SupportTheConstitution #FakeNationalEmergency I can’t wait for this to go to the SCOTUS
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz I don’t care about Beto. They have not conducted a joint formal study. If they did that, I’d go with their recommendation. They’re the experts, not me, you, or @realDonaldTrump. So far, both sides just interview random members of those departments who agree with wall vs. no wall.
@realDonaldTrump Build while you can, idiot. The SCOTUS is going to shut down your unconstitutional “emergency”.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz That’s stupid. There’s better ways to secure the border and reduce crime than “a wall”. The new spending bill was a good start, it just needs more funding. The best way to figure this out would be to have CBP and DHS do a study and make a formal recommendation.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz That may be true, but you’re one person. That’s like me saying that because there’s a mountain lion in my backyard, there’s mountain lions in everyone’s backyards. It’s just not the case.
@VOTEMAGA2020 @JJussely @RepMattGaetz You’re not familiar with the scientific method or statistics, are you?
@Elizabe81542283 @chiproytx My point is that none of these people want to discuss the FACT that the number of Americans killed each year by illegal immigrants is a very small number.
Wtf? https://t.co/OY0au0c63Z
@JJussely @RepMattGaetz Based on drug consumption, they’ve estimated that 85% of drugs come through ports of entry. It’s not that complicated.
@chiproytx How many Americans are murdered each year by illegal immigrants?
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz No. I’m a fiscal conservative. All this ridiculous spending is insane.
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz *You’re 😉 😂😂 		It’s cute how you think your (correct use) made up ideas matter. The fact is, this “emergency” will go to the SCOTUS and be declared unconstitutional, as it should be. Roberts won’t let Trump ignore Article I.

@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz MOST Americans don’t believe a wall is a solution. It’s moronic to think it would work they way @realDonaldTrump is trying to pretend it will. And no, there’s not money just lying around, our debt is $22 trillion and rising.
@MsAvaArmstrong @TeaPartyRodT The CBO
@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz A) Don’t pretend it’s about security. If that we’re the case, they’d be asking for a wall on BOTH borders.	B) Both sides support funding for security that works: technology, staffing, SOME additional strategic walls or barriers.	C) Trump’s emergency is unconstitutional.
@MsAvaArmstrong @TeaPartyRodT They also pay $10.64 billion in taxes annually for benefits that many are unable to access. That’s $106.4 billion in 10 years in revenue. Numbers are fun.
@EdMcNeal @cologop No, they do not. Not even a little bit.
@cologop So we shouldn’t “come together to stand up against homophobia, racism, and all forms of hate”? Seems like an odd platform.
There are people truly suffering from hate crimes whose stories will be ignored because of you @JussieSmollett. That was a despicable thing to do. I hope the consequences are dire. https://t.co/X0Eap5lAA8
@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz I lose interest when you start making things up. They can’t even secure 1/10 of the funding they need for the wall alone, but do you think they’re going to secure funding for increased technology along the wall they’ll never build?
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz The majority of people don’t have fences in their yard. And our own homes are very different from an entire nation. I’m not paying to put a fence in your yard.
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz If they are pretending this is about stopping drugs and they know that 85% of the drugs come through ports of entry, why build a wall where only 15% of the drugs are coming through?
@ChelyB8 @RepMattGaetz So you really think that people won’t just climb over the wall if no one is there? I could be over that wall in 30 seconds. We just authorized billions of dollars in spending for the specific purpose of reinforcing ports of entry.
@Tool_Queen @NPR @relucasz How about Bill Cosby who was actually sick and aged (and rich) and was not given leniency after sentencing? Straight to prison.
@mgd_the @RepMattGaetz Where the drugs are already coming through? He’s trying to pretend people are lugging tons of meth through the desert to justify a wall. There’s no evidence to support that.

They have not done it in this way. By specifically using this to procure funding, he bypassed Congress’ Constitutional mandate. End of story. Bye 👋
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty I bet the Japanese-Americans who were forced into internment camps had the same idea.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty I’m not debating @realDonaldTrump’s truthfulness, he’s a proven habitual liar. If we allow this to stand, we’re setting ourselves up for the next Democrat POTUS to take all military funding to address the “climate change emergency”. That’s how it works, it’s reflexive.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty He also DECLARED unequivocally that Mexico would pay for the wall. When it comes to safeguarding the Constitution, no one’s “word” is good enough.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty And if our military was building the wall, that argument MIGHT pass muster.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty Interment camps were a (horrible and reprehensible) policy decision. This “emergency” is solely fiscal as the spending bill provides plenty of funding for border security. I’m not sure why you want to argue against the very clear distinctions made in Article I. Take care.
@eachus @tomjones_13 @AP4Liberty The unprecedented part relates to requisitioning funding that was already denied by Congress. Fiscal duties are specifically granted to Congress in Article I. To go around them by declaring an “emergency” is unconstitutional.

@replouiegohmert So you think the Constitution is open to interpretation? Article I is pretty clear about who gets to raise funds. You gave away your power today. #ImpotentCongress #FakeNationalEmergency #IllegitimatePresident
@TeaPartyRodT I’d argue that it’s unconstitutional when it involves stripping Congress of its constitutional powers. To be fair, legal and constitutional are not synonymous.

@AP4Liberty For real. If this “emergency” stands and allows a POTUS to circumvent Congress to grab unlimited funding, we’ve allowed the establishment of a dictatorship.
@mattgaetz Interesting this is your concern as the President declares a state of emergency to circumvent Congress’ Constitutional mandate to control the purse. You’re giving away your power without a fight. Hopefully the SCOTUS is smarter. #IllegitimatePOTUS #ImpotentCongress
@TeaPartyRodT @realDonaldTrump I’d rather they end the other emergencies than give any President carte blanche to declare en emergency to circumvent Congress. Then we’re no different than Venezuela.

@LindseyGrahamSC Big surprise 🙄 How easily you gave away your Constitutional powers. Let’s hope the SCOTUS doesn’t roll over so easily. You’re a lapdog. #IllegitimatePOTUS #IllegitimatePresident #ImpotentCongress
@TeaPartyRodT And that’s great (kind of, the cartel is apparently still just as strong), but my concern is that @realDonaldTrump’s “emergency” is simply an excuse to secure funding that Congress decided not to provide. Obama’s emergency, to my knowledge, did not do this.
@TeaPartyRodT I’m pretty sure that related to allowing the US to seize assets of international criminals (Zetas, Yakusa, Mafia), not requisition funds Congress voted not to award the day before.

@Jim_Jordan A) Illegal immigration has been declining since 2000	B) Fentanyl and other drugs primarily come through ports of entry, a wall won’t help	C) Murder, regardless of citizenship status, won’t be solved by a wall	D) The CONSTITUTION gives spending to Congress!

@RepThomasMassie Congrats Congress, you just gave up your Constitutional directive. #ImpotentCongress
I’ve avoided making this declaration since his election, but this move is unconstitutional. He is, without justifiable cause, bypassing Congress who has Constitutionally granted power over spending. @realDonaldTrump is an #IllegitimatePresident #illegitimatePOTUS #treason https://t.co/FkJuQJTbzr
@TeaPartyRodT He should concede that “The Wall” was oversimplified in his campaign and he really meant overall border security that includes barriers in strategic areas. That’s what he’s getting by signing which is good.
@TeaPartyRodT Watch: Next Dem POTUS is going to declare emergencies for gun violence and climate change and bypass Congress completely. If the SCOTUS supports Trump’s “emergency” we’re boned.
@TeaPartyRodT Considering illegal immigration has been continually decreasing for almost 20 years, it’s not really an emergency. This just opens the door for Presidents to declare emergencies to bypass Congress and fund any dipshit idea that pops into their heads.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yeah, there is. Considering illegal immigration is 60% lower than it was in 2000 and most illegal drugs come through ports of entry, the @POTUS has no valid reason to declare an emergency. It’s unconstitutional.
@RepGosar https://t.co/uGPmZaxFql
@Acosta Was his doctor from North Korea or just the press release?
@TeaPartyRodT Right? She’s literally African-American.
@seanhannity That has nothing to do with a wall. The drugs come through the ports of entry in vehicles.
@seanhannity @POTUS a national emergency whenever they can’t get funding through Congress who, as defined by our Constitution, is supposed to hold the purse strings. 2/2
@seanhannity No. It sets a dangerous precedent. Yes, other emergencies have been declared, but were the result of more definite action forcing events. Illegal immigration has been an issue for years and has been decreasing in recent years. It sets the stage for any @POTUS to declare...1/2

@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse So you’re saying the scope, severity, and frequency of school shootings is the same now as it was 30, 40, 50 years ago?
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse A) We don’t have universal background checks yet.	B) I simply pointed out an unlocked safe might as well be a closet.	C) A locked safe may have prevented the Sandy Hook attack	D) Gun owners should be held accountable for the use of their firearms.

@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse A safe would have stopped the entire incident. That’s my point.
@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Not a very reliable study when you survey predominantly gun owners (78%) and extrapolate that frequency onto the entire US population.
@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Probably because mass shootings have gone up so much.
@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Gun violence and accidental child deaths from guns are very different things.
@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Here we’re in agreement. We need to go after the people who allow these weapons to fall into the hands of criminals.
@F_Prefect @SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Got any data on that?
@spallinojo No shit! Can you answer a damn question or not? How has our alliance with Israel benefitted us?
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse The Sandy Hook shooter used his mother’s firearms which she obviously failed to secure properly.
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse Guess what, firearms are deadly weapons. They cause tens of thousands of deaths a year. Whether you like it or not, regulations will be increasing until gun violence goes down. Personally, I don’t mind more in depth background checks.
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse I had to go to the shop to buy the gun and my shop covers the cost. And yes, I expect responsible gun owners to be responsible for their guns. You act like a firearm isn’t a deadly weapon. I see no reason why I should be able to get a gun easier than I get a driver’s license.
@SlideMagic @RepJoeNeguse My last background check took 5 minutes. Not really a pain in the ass.

@NRA @GReschenthaler How’s that?

@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi It’s easy to come up with “plans” when they consist of, “Duh....Imma build a big ole wall. That’ll git’er done.”
@GTURN66 @WhiteHouse @POTUS The original? There have been laws restricting ownership and use of firearms since non-natives set foot in North America. We also continue to see ridiculous levels of firearm-related deaths. Something needs to be done because our current and past systems have failed.
@Janice01712062 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Only took a day for that blistering comeback 😂😂 Is it the morning shift in Moscow comrade? 🇷🇺 By the way, if you’re calling someone a “dumass”, you should spell it correctly, dumbass.
@GTURN66 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Maybe we should get rid of the whole lot and start over with something that could actually work.
@GTURN66 @WhiteHouse @POTUS I don’t think banning guns would make us more safe. I’d love for you to point out one time I’ve ever supported that. There’s room between no regulation and banning firearms if you’re not a Democrat or a Republican.
@GTURN66 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sorry, I thought you had actual statistics rather than coincidences. The Dow has risen drastically over that time, maybe that caused crime to drop. 🙄

@GOP @EricTrump Nice beard. I remember being in 8th grade too.
@GOPChairwoman I guess the State of Virginia will have to decide that, not you.
@TeresaH45241205 @WhiteHouse @POTUS So how do we ensure that guns only end up in the right hands? Our system now isn’t working.
@grandmacindy77 @WhiteHouse @POTUS True. But that’s not stopping our gun violence issue. Something has to be done and more guns isn’t the answer.
@KenF74921261 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sure, but how do you effectively keep firearms out of the hands of “deranged” people? The laws we currently have obviously aren’t working.
@JoanneEggli @WhiteHouse @POTUS I’d support a law requiring all gun owners to attend annual training on firearm safety. I’d do it. Also, that Switzerland comment is false. I lived in Geneva for 2 years.
@ACline99 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Well, it means your claim that people aren’t buying guns legally and trading them for drugs is, in fact, false. It is a common occurrence. And your assumption that I condone taking firearms from law-abiding citizens is ludicrous.
@ACline99 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Great whataboutism 🙄 I own 6 Glocks, 2 Daniel Defense ARs, numerous hunting rifles, and dozens of shotguns. I’ve got my CCW in 46 states and have carried for work when I worked in federal law enforcement. I’m definitely more familiar with illegal firearm trafficking than you.
@ACline99 @WhiteHouse @POTUS I don’t know why you can’t make the distinction between were and we’re. The issue is that in many cases, legally purchased firearms are put on the black market and become illegal. For instance, these weapons are likely being traded for drugs and heading south.
@Ray67030602 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Yes Ray67030602 (as if I’m talking to a real person) 🙄 I own many firearms. I agree that people should have access to them. But we need to do more to make sure shit like this isn’t happening.
@cohen_miri @WhiteHouse @POTUS Absolutely. But we’re obviously not doing enough to ensure that firearms are not getting into the hand of the wrong people.
@lose_elsewhere @WhiteHouse @POTUS Uh oh, because I have tons of guns. What makes me unqualified to own my firearms?
@grandmacindy77 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sure bot. And it’s “Constitution”. Practice your English comrade.
@GovMikeHuckabee So news outlets should not publish anything about claims being made until those claims are substantiated? I guess @FoxNews will have to go dark.

@Q2x17 @cthalpin @Janisslee @WhiteHouse @POTUS Or maybe, just maybe, many of them were purchased legally in the US and then sold into the black market. I don’t know, I only worked in federal law enforcement for 4 years. Maybe you know more about firearm trafficking than me.

@GOTIceWallinTX @WhiteHouse @POTUS I knew they had to list the SNs for weapons you were considering for purchase, but I didn’t know they reported which one(s) you actually purchased. The form only seems to ask how many firearms were purchased, not which ones. Unless I’m missing that line.
@Q2x17 @cthalpin @Janisslee @WhiteHouse @POTUS Sounds like you’re a #MAGAt Realistically, the chances are good that these weapons were purchased legally in the United States and were destined south in exchange for drugs. There’s no need to bring guns to Texas.
@GOTIceWallinTX @WhiteHouse @POTUS No, it doesn’t. Background checks don’t have any firearm info because you get them done BEFORE you purchase the firearm.
@Stupedkid @WhiteHouse @POTUS That would be nice, but it seems unlikely for at least the next 2 years.
@davetv28 @cthalpin @Janisslee @WhiteHouse @POTUS Where do you think they got the idea for Operation Fast and Furious?
@GOTIceWallinTX @WhiteHouse @POTUS How do you know? The article says they were “found”. They could easily have been purchased legally and left there. That doesn’t make them illegal (though it should). And where do you live where you have to register your firearms? We don’t in CO.

@realDonaldTrump Adderall is kicking in! https://t.co/ucTf871Jof
@deathdragon007 @NRA “Google it” 🙄
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA That’s fair.
@deathdragon007 @politiKutie @NRA A restraining does not necessarily have anything to do with a crime. Anyone can request a restraining order for any reason. The judge decides if it’s warranted. And being drunk isn’t a crime, but being drunk and in possession of a firearm is.
@deathdragon007 @NRA Do you have data to support that? I checked the Bureau of Justice Statistics and I’m not seeing anything that supports your assertion. Private sales are the easiest way to skirt background checks. That’s the so-called “gun show loophole”.
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA Drug use (self-professed) and restraining orders/history of stalking can both result in failed background checks.
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA Untrue. There are other ways firearm ownership is already legally restricted beyond felony conviction: drug use and misdemeanor domestic violence violations. The current #2A interpretation does not rule out other means of restriction either. It would likely go to the SCOTUS.
@politiKutie @deathdragon007 @NRA Hence “expanded background checks”. I agree our current system is inadequate. My last background check took less than 5 min. That is not thorough.
@realDonaldTrump @AP4Liberty Could that be because you storm out of the room like an angry child when you don’t get what you want?
@deathdragon007 @NRA In how many of the mass shootings over the last 20 years did the shooter(s) fail to procure their firearm(s) legally? How many of them procured them legally?
@GOP @parscale It’s a good thing you were able to secure the opinion of a campaign manager. https://t.co/1QotJYEul3
@UtahTeaPartyROD And takes away their pensions
@NRA It’s common sense that expanded background checks would identify individuals with histories of mental illness and domestic violence.
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Who quotes themself on Twitter? You can just Tweet your idiotic thought.
@kellyberry404 @GOP There is no country on the planet similar to ours that has attempted a wall along an entire border, so your assertion is spurious. Yes, the Vatican City and Israel have walls, but they do not have illegal immigration issues. Take care, I’m not going over the same point ad nauseam
@kellyberry404 @GOP Numerous estimates place the total costs at up to $50 billion. Regardless, $5 billion does not complete the project and will not be effective, assuming a wall by itself would even be effective, which is unlikely.
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Isn’t he the one who walked out of the room? What a petulant child.
@kellyberry404 @GOP But $5 billion is only 10% of construction costs. That doesn’t even consider maintenance and staffing. Improved legislation can stem the flow of illegal immigration more quickly and cost effectively.
@kellyberry404 @GOP I completely agree. However, the current Administration has shown no interest in comprehensive immigration reform, only a wall. I can’t get behind that as a rational method of addressing the issue of illegal immigration.
@GOP “Immigration system” and “wall” are not synonymous.

@JohnCornyn Still waiting on actual footage of the “crisis” you speak of. Where is it?
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu I’ll give you that. Facts don’t matter in policy. Unfortunately, there’s no point in having any discussion in which facts are ignored. And it certainly leads to fruitless spending.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu “expanding into the unexplained stuff that facts have not told us” Would you really try saying that in court? Really?
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu Usually, yes, you do. Not here. You’re making assumptions to validate your point of view rather than following facts.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu There’s something I’d vote to spend my tax money on.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu I’m over this discussion. You’re purposefully being obtuse to promote this wall agenda. I’m sorry, but you’re usually more logical. Have a good night.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu Those are lots of questions. Did his camera show them carrying drugs? We KNOW they come through the ports of entry.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu And any farmer who lost 80% of their crop in transport would go out of business.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu Lol. C’mon. You know that’s no argument. If we’re concerned about drugs and we know exactly where a majority enter our country, why would we redirect our enforcement to an area that is admittedly unsubstantiated? It’s completely illogical.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu If 80% of their product were intercepted, cartels would not be in business (estimates are 20% intercepted). Also, heroin and cocaine are not produced in the US. Regardless of who created the prescription drug epidemic, much of it is smuggled into the US from Canada.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu So if we can’t know, how can it be a primary reason they say we need the wall?
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu How can you say that when there is no lack of drugs? Heroin, cocaine, and meth are cheaper now than in years. Millions of illegal prescription drugs are available in every community.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu The fact is that which enters via land comes through the ports of entry like Tijuana or Juarez. There aren’t trains of migrants hiking tons of drugs through the desert.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @tedlieu The amount of drugs consumed annually compared to the amount intercepted shows that our mitigation efforts are woefully lacking. That’s where the $5 billion (and more) should go instead of building a dumbass wall.
@UtahTeaPartyROD If they’re going to pretend a wall will slow the import of drugs when it is well-known that the vast majority of drugs enter the US through ports of entry rather than unsecured sections of the border, then @tedlieu’s criticism is valid.

@SallyAlbright Ah, they’re talking about funding issues starting in Feb if the gov’t shutdown is still going on. I’d be surprised if they don’t have a spending bill by then. People should still have received their Jan benefits.
@Frankie92300 @NRA Lack of willingness to accept responsibility is what’s going to lead to our guns getting taken away but by bit. Also, it’s incredibly ignorant to pretend this issue will be fixed by education. If that were the case, no one would commit crimes. Take care.
@SallyAlbright Hmm...that would be bad. I’ll ask around and see what’s up.
@SallyAlbright In CO we’re still getting our federal SNAP dollars and our system is still automatically transferring approved benefits to the correct EBT cards. Where is this problem happening?

@thedeeraddict @NRA But I don’t accept that changes can’t be made to reduce the levels of gun violence that we experience. Simply allowing federal studies of the issue would be a good start. 2/2
@thedeeraddict @NRA My point is that the @NRA wants to say that guns protect people, but don’t harm people. You can’t have it both ways. I hate the @NRA for their hypocrisy. I strongly support the #2A and Scalia’s interpretation in Heller. I don’t support a ban or further limitations to access 1/2
@Frankie92300 @NRA That’s just ridiculous. If you own a firearm, you’re responsible for how that weapon is used. If you don’t believe that, you shouldn’t own firearms.
@thedeeraddict @NRA Dipshit. Name one time I’ve called for a gun ban. I own guns, but my guns will never fall into the hands of children. A ban is no answer. Saying children dying from gun violence is “shit happens” is heartless and just fucking pathetic.
@thedeeraddict @ScottChalleen @NRA Source?
@Frankie92300 @NRA Should have. Who knows, maybe they did. Teenagers aren’t known for their rational decision making. Whomever allowed them access to the gun should be held accountable.
@dwilki2 @NRA except for when I’m carrying. 2/2
@dwilki2 @NRA You might want to read Heller v. DC. The two are very much related. I’m not saying people should have guns taken away, just held responsible. If you let your gun fall into the hands of someone who uses it to commit a crime, you should go to prison. All my guns are locked up 1/2
@AndySmith9999 @NRA Put your guns in a damn safe. That’s where mine are when I’m not carrying. It’s not much of a sacrifice to possibly save a life. Owning a firearm is a responsibility as much as it’s a right.
@thedeeraddict @NRA You’re a disgusting excuse for a human being. They were kids. Regardless of your position on gun control, kids dying isn’t a “shit happens” situation.
@cerno1987 @ThatScottSmith @Mtnman1320 @NRA Why do you doubt that? This sort of thing happens all the time. Not securing your weapons is the same as giving them to a child. All my firearms are locked up when they’re not in my possession. Firearm ownership is as much a responsibility as a right.

@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Here, for the 2nd time, is the Texas statute defining manslaughter:		Sec. 19.04.  MANSLAUGHTER.  (a)  A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of an individual.		Driving without a license is not “reckless”.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden 3) Yes, they could have and should have deported him.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden 1) You didn’t link a statute, you linked to a Google-searched law blog.	2) It doesn’t say what you’re saying. It says if negligence is determined in the accident, it can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor based on circumstances. This was never the charge in this case.
@AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic Sucks when businesses run their business, huh?
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden And there is NO American law that says an illegal immigrant who hurts an American must be deported. You’re just making things up. Deportation is a policy, not a law, and it is solely related to immigration status.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden There are laws to deport regardless of whether a crime, outside of the misdemeanor of illegal entry, has been committed. You are trying to place fault strictly based on immigration status. Do you not understand what “negligence” or “fault” mean?
@mercedesschlapp What’s the border crisis? Illegal immigration is down. Mass hysteria is not a crisis.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Sec. 19.04.  MANSLAUGHTER.  (a)  A person commits an offense if he recklessly causes the death of an individual.		Driving without a license is not “reckless”.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Manslaughter relates to the outcome (death of another human being), fault, and intent. Without outcome AND fault, manslaughter can’t be charged. It was determined to be an accident.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden There’s nothing to rebut, you’re just wrong and obviously prejudiced against illegal (brown) aliens. Being in the US without legal status isn’t a crime. Entering illegally is a misdemeanor. That has no bearing on a charge of manslaughter, involuntary or otherwise.
@e_uisa @SheIsMeIamHer2 @realDonaldTrump Real tough coming from the UK 🙄 No one is suggesting we take everyone. There is an asylum process. Don’t like it, change the law. Until then, you can’t deny that process to certain groups of people.

@e_uisa @SheIsMeIamHer2 @realDonaldTrump Why not make the legal route feasible through legislation? Also, it’s hard to seek asylum legally when dozens of ports of entry are closed to asylum seekers.

@DanCrenshawTX It saddens me that you’re going to follow @realDonaldTrump down the road of attacking the media for factually reporting stories. I was hoping you’d be a part of a new @GOP that would stay out of the sideshow.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Involuntary manslaughter involves some finding of fault. The police found the driver not to be at fault. I’m not saying they’re right, we don’t know that, but that’s the law. The law exists to protect as well as punish. Driving w/o a license does not automatically confer guilt.
@spauldingIII @NBCNews Good one 👍 😂😂😂

@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden Have you visited the website and read the account of the accident? The law doesn’t work that way. He was found to be not at fault. You can’t just make up laws.
@SCSmartass And you think they’d believe you? You need to pull your politics out of your religion. Take care.
@spauldingIII @NBCNews Did I say anything about illegal immigration? Nope. Just pointed out the fake outrage. You people don’t care about police being killed, you just have some strange hatred for immigrants.
@spauldingIII @NBCNews Imagine if people cared as much about the other 90 people murdered in the US over the last two days, predominately by “fine US citizens”. Or the 46 other law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty by US citizens this year.
@seanhannity No one ever said illegal immigration wasn’t wrong. They just want there to be immigration reform before wasting money on a wall.
@bwench01 A wall without legal reform is a waste.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden You should add that to your description of the accident. I’d also hit them with the TPIA and get documentation from them that shows that, if you haven’t already.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden It’s not fair to your daughter, she did not deserve that.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden I did. I read every word before I commented. And I never referred to your daughter’s death as “just an accident”. Regardless of how horrible the circumstances, police and judges are required to follow the law as written.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden My perspective is that if the federal government wants to treat illegal entry as a serious crime, they should make it a serious crime. Make it a felony with mandatory minimum sentences. I’ll support that. That’s not the law now though.
@TXVET4Justice @terri911065 @sabine_durden I’m sorry for your loss. I’m just referring to the information you have on your web page. Entering the US illegally is a misdemeanor. The police, according to you, found he was not at fault. If I’m wrong about that, I apologize.
@terri911065 @TXVET4Justice @sabine_durden What violent charge? The charge was driving without a license. The driver was sober and found to not be at fault. A tragedy, but an accident.

@realDonaldTrump You keep giving away money to cover up your idiotic blunders. That’s not how you get a strong economy. Hence our descent into recession that’s already started...
@TuckerCarlson Lol. This quack is pretending it’s ok to treat illegal immigrants like trash because he cares so much about the environment 🙄 Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump has opened millions of acres of public land to oil and gas companies. But that’s cool.
@GeorgePapa19 This doesn’t make you innocent, just guilty AND stupid.
@NRA @JohnStossel @JohnRLottJr Lol. Still on this garbage study? They can’t even defend their own data. They said they removed gang/drug violence shootings from US data to be accurate, yet left in terrorism and war violence for the world data. It’s pathetic.

@11n11a11d11 @Hollywood009 @AP No. But if I thought my kid’s life was in danger where I was living, I’d do ANYTHING within my power to get them somewhere safe.
@parscale Non-wartime? Last I checked, our troops are still fighting in numerous countries in the Middle East. But you’ll overlook that to pull more favorable stats for your propaganda machine.

@GeorgePapa19 @RWPUSA @CNNPolitics How was jail, winner? https://t.co/0v6z9Oorss
@UtahTeaPartyROD Numerous countries with single payer systems still have private insurance that supplements the state-funded system if people want additional coverage. We all pay in already, with single payer, we’d actually pay less.
@EricHolder If you just call it the ACA, Trump supporters wont know what you’re talking about and quit caring. Or, they might finally realize that’s how many of them were able to finally get insurance...
@UtahTeaPartyROD Single payer doesn’t mean there’s only one choice, it just means all Americans have a basic level of coverage that gets them cost-free access to healthcare. Almost all single payer systems still have a private insurance sector.
@UtahTeaPartyROD As long as it’s a pass-through, I’m ok with it. There’s no hands-off approach the healthcare for the government.
@UtahTeaPartyROD Single payer also makes it easier to push pharmaceutical companies to lower prices to those that are paid by...other single payer systems. One payer for ALL of America gets a really good deal on prescription drugs.
@UtahTeaPartyROD Yes. And we need to eliminate the excessive admin costs (reduce number of insurers). 30% of medical costs are administrative. This is why single payer makes sense.
@UtahTeaPartyROD that drove up the costs in the first place. 2/2
@UtahTeaPartyROD Such as? And do you remember the first drafts of the ACA? Before all the concessions were made to get it passed? Bottom line is: Millions of Americans have access to healthcare that the current Administration is trying to take away while giving tax cuts to the corporations.. 1/2
@UtahTeaPartyROD We could ALL afford healthcare if the Feds didn’t allow prescription drug companies and private insurance companies to run amok.
@UtahTeaPartyROD Access to healthcare is a “feel good social reform”? It’s also a fiscal benefit: preventative medicine leads to lower incidence of chronic disease and major health issues that cost many times more than the preventative measures.
@JudgeJeanine @Scaramucci His interview lasted longer than his tenure as Press Secretary.
@JudgeJeanine @Scaramucci https://t.co/J1WAYaUHXu
@UtahTeaPartyROD Millions were able to actually get healthcare. Pre-existing conditions were abolished. If you somehow “sank into poverty”, you’d at least be able to get Medicaid.
@JudgeJeanine @dbongino @ChristopherHahn So for the previous two years who was he at a stand-off with on wall funding? You know, when they controlled the House and the Senate.
@JudgeJeanine @AlanDersh Don’t @FoxNews viewers get sick of hearing the same commentators chat with the same guests saying the same thing over and over again?

@UtahTeaPartyROD @AnnCoulter It’s the same as Mika Brzezinski calling Pompeo Trump’s “butt boy”. They mean those terms as slurs and there’s no room for that nonsense.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @AnnCoulter I think when you’re being derogatory, you should be held accountable for using hate speech. Unless you identify as a “college queer”, those are probably words best left out your mouth.
@UtahTeaPartyROD @AnnCoulter https://t.co/6fLPcQq3fD		22 sec in

@Nunyabus99999 @NRA I studied Constitutional law at Hopkins, so don’t try to pretend this is over my head
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA Yeah, like I said, I’ve read it. Regardless of the background, it became the defining decision for #2A interpretation. The @NRA is asserting in their article that it was incorrect to venture outside the bounds of the case. What about that don’t you understand?
@CrimeResearch1 @Slov819 @NRA Would you like the CSV file with the list of mass shootings in the US in 2018 to cross reference? Send me your email, I’ll get it right over to you. It has dates, locations, and # of victims. All verifiable from multiple sources. Yes, even @FoxNews.
@NRA Certainly not defenders of factual information.
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA I’ve read Heller plenty. I agree with Scalia’s interpretation on the #2A. The @NRA article claims that the SCOTUS went beyond its reach in ruling on issues besides firearm storage in DC a specifically called out their provisions on limiting firearm access to felons &amp; mentally ill
@Slov819 @NRA @CrimeResearch1 Not questionable, it’s patently false information. In 2018 alone there have been 70 mass shooting incidences in which 5 or more people (per incidence) have been injured or killed.

@AverageDave1 @DonJT_be_a_dick @NRA @CrimeResearch1 How about the FACT that in the US in 2018 there have been 70 mass shooting incidences in which 5 or more individuals have been injured or killed? @NRA says it’s only 53 in 18 years. How about the 25 instances THIS YEAR in which 3 or more people were shot to death?
@NRA @CrimeResearch1 25 in 2018 in which 3 or more people were KILLED.
@NRA @CrimeResearch1 If you’d like an actual, verifiable fact, there have been 70 mass shooting incidences in the United States in 2018 in which 5 or more people (per event) were injured or killed.

@TJ_TacoJack @NRA Explain how a Justice writing a dissenting opinion can “substitute his opinion for law”. Have you read Heller? I have. I agree with Scalia. Regardless of how Scalia came to his decision, it was the majority opinion and therefore the current judicial interpretation of the #2A.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA So then how did Justice Stevens “substitute his opinion for law”?
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA Dumbass, I told you I’ve looked on the DOJ and FBI sites for the statistics you’re pretending to have. They don’t exist. Present your proof or be proven a fraud. That’s how academia works.

@Nunyabus99999 @NRA So you don’t understand English? Does your quote not show that the NRA feels that the Heller decision was at least flawed, if not invalid?
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA The majority opinion in Heller was written by Scalia, you idiot.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA No. All I said is that more people were killed in the same year that CCW permits increased. The fact is that residents of DC (higher chance of being killed) with more people carrying concealed weapons. Present your data liar.
@Nunyabus99999 @NRA So you can’t read. Ok. Did you miss the part where they said the SCOTUS overstepped their bounds in Heller declaring that felons and people suffering from mental illness should have limited access to firearms?

@JbrownESQ @JamesBondkill @marxist_christ @RT_com I’d support having their parents come and drag their insolent asses out of the classroom. They can stay home until they learn how to follow the rules. Why is this so confusing for people?
@JamesBondkill @JbrownESQ @marxist_christ @RT_com He did. The kid refused. And you can’t drag him out of the room...
@JamesBondkill @JbrownESQ @marxist_christ @RT_com You don’t allow students to be openly insubordinate and defy the rules everyone else is expected to respect.
RIP Sir https://t.co/9ZC8Qwq8Mc
@JackPosobiec It’s called a retraction. It happens every day. Unless it’s @FoxNews. Then they just say they’re not a news network but entertainment programs.
@JbrownESQ @marxist_christ @RT_com I guess we’ll never know since the other students were apparently respectful enough to not break the rules and wear headgear into the classroom.
@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA Show it since you’ve supposedly done it. I’ve looked for an FBI or DOJ statistic that says the 50% increase in homicides in DC in 2018 is due to increased justifiable homicides. It doesn’t exist. I’m done with this conversation until you provide your data.
@CaliB88 @Poormanumbrella @ThomasSowell Thanks for the apology. I wasn’t trying to be a smartass.
@uttppROD @danielledsouzag I’m more of a capitalist than most conservatives I guess.
@uttppROD Right? Who cares at this point? We all know he was not as rich as he pretended to be and that he was a shady businessman who didn’t pay taxes. What’s it matter now?
@danielledsouzag @uttppROD So she’s angry she got banned from a free platform for violating the TOS she agreed to and her logical response is to trespass on their private property?
@CaliB88 @Poormanumbrella @ThomasSowell Thanks for answering my question like an asshole. How stupid of me to ask for clarification. 🙄
@CaliB88 @Poormanumbrella @ThomasSowell His resume? Doesn’t his profile say he’s NOT Thomas Sowell?
@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA You stated exactly that. You said the DOJ and FBI has data showing that homicides in DC had increased due to higher incidences of justifiable homicide in which CCW carriers protected themselves from criminals. Now you’re lying about it. Go be a moron elsewhere.
@ReneeLibby2 And stupid. Don’t forget stupid.
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump If they want to charge me under the Hatch Act, it’ll be an interesting day in court when they have to explain why I’m charged and @POTUS, @KellyannePolls, and @PressSec weren’t. Bring it. https://t.co/Wd0MiTl0k0

@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA Dumbass. Those are DC Metropolitan Police crime statistics. The raw data. They do not separate out the data the way you suggest. The DOJ and FBI get their statistics from local departments. Post your data or fuck off with your made up shit. Idiot.

@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA So still no actual evidence or statistics, just unsubstantiated opinions. And yes, I’m an American. I live in Colorado and I carry every day for work. I’ve also studied statistics for my Masters degree. So please show me this data you’re pretending to have or just go away. 🤷‍♂️
@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA https://t.co/EYikoXSlrL
@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA So you don’t have supporting documentation. Cool.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA Let’s see that data.
@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA Post a link to that data.
@TJ_TacoJack @FruitJaw @NRA I get what you’re trying to imply, but you have no facts or data, so you have no point. You’re just making things up.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA No, that’s false. Once again, you’re making things up. Go ahead and check out the DC Metropolitan Police website. Show me where it separates homicides and murders.
@KatrinaPierson The issue with Trump’s attempt to institute public charge is that he is trying to apply it to children who are citizens.
@SarahPalinUSA Chicksonright really hedge their bets that their readers will only read the headline, not the article. 😂😂		And nothing any Trump does is classy...ever.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA I’ll save you some time. It doesn’t exist. You’re making things up.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA Do you think “statistic” is a verb? Please show me the statistics you found in which the DC police department declares that the 50% increase in homicides were all justifiable homicides.
@FruitJaw @TJ_TacoJack @NRA Good one. Original.
@FruitJaw @TJ_TacoJack @NRA And this is just an ignorant statement.
@TJ_TacoJack @NRA What are you talking about? Homicides (people who were murdered) increased by 50% when CCW permits (good guys with guns) increased exponentially. I thought more people carrying guns legally was supposed to make us more safe?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I bet you’d trade that win for the House majority in a heartbeat.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Tell me again why what @IvankaTrump thinks matters
@NRA Interesting that the homicide rate in DC increased by 50% the same year that CCW permits increased by 1440%.
@NRA @MrColionNoir Who exactly has called for banning ALL firearms?

@uttppROD What’s ridiculous is that during the last month when everyone was freaking out about 5,000 migrants in TJ, approx 25k crossed elsewhere. The US needs illegal immigration. Big business doesn’t want it to stop, neither do the feds. They just play on people’s insecurities for votes.
@KatrinaPierson Is that the metric now? You can’t speak about an underserved population unless you’re “sponsoring them in your home”? Such a stupid and ignorant response. Nice deflection @KatrinaPierson. It’s perfectly reasonable to advocate for a population without housing them in your house.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yeah, why don’t you ask the GM workers about that. This is just the start thanks to your dumbass tax cuts and tariffs. Actions have consequences, you idiots.

@uttppROD I hear him say that he believes in separation of powers and that he disagrees with the Court’s decision, but he does not single anyone out or claim the Court is ineffective. This is nothing like @realDonaldTrump’s comments towards Chief Justice Roberts.
@uttppROD Did he individually criticize the non-court opinions of the Justices?

@Muddy_Flower @thedeeraddict A lot of those comments are disturbing. $215k is a bit out of my price range. I’ll look into whether the M134 would be legal in CO. At $72k I could consider it, but I bet it costs $25/sec to fire it, lol.
@thedeeraddict You’re a better judge of Constitutional interpretation than one of the most highly regarded conservative SCOTUS Justices in American history? Ok 🙄
@thedeeraddict Also, if you read DC v. Heller, the prevailing SCOTUS interpretation of the #2A, you’ll see that Justice Scalia unequivocally states that the government must have the power to regulate firearm ownership to protect the safety of the general public.
@Muddy_Flower @thedeeraddict For an RPG? I’ve got my Class III in CO, but I can’t buy a M134 or RPG. Trust me, if I could legally own either of those, I would.
@KatrinaPierson I don’t believe him or Kavanaugh.
@thedeeraddict Yes, everything for sale on the Internet is real and legal. Can you go buy a mini gun or RPG where you live? I can’t here in CO.

@thedeeraddict @NRA @DCPoliceDept No, you’re extrapolating beyond what the data shows. In order to make determinations about California, there would need to be a change introduced to measure the impact of the change.
@traviscim03 @LukeAmato2 @GerrybombS @NRA @DCPoliceDept Getting the license and insurance would be the first step.
@thedeeraddict @NRA @DCPoliceDept Right, but the homicide rate increased drastically. The fact is that DC residents were more likely to be murdered following the massive increase in CCW permits, meaning they were less safe. The @NRA wants to claim more “good guys with guns” makes us more safe. That’s false.
This idiot.  https://t.co/FBTvSkcdGA
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept You’re wrong, you’re just too stupid to realize it apparently. Take care.
@thedeeraddict @NRA @DCPoliceDept Good point. I’d like to see that data. I didn’t see that on their site. But it does indicate that the 1440% increase in CCW permits did not make the DC population any more safe.
@thedeeraddict @NRA @DCPoliceDept Provided. Anything else?
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept Easily? Not for private citizens. For only industrial or professional exceptions. Stop being stupid, it’s pathetic. I own fully automatic firearms, I’m aware of the process here in CO. Not complicated. In Switzerland, it’s essentially impossible for private citizens.
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept Jesus Christ, it says right there “an exception to the law”. Meaning, the law bans automatic weapons. You don’t know what you’re talking about, you’re just Googling shit that agrees with what you want to hear.
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept So you can’t read a bibliography? Id. art 4 refers back to the 4th citation. It’s like Ibid. Just because there’s no hyperlink doesn’t mean the reference doesn’t exist. Do some reading. Hell, go visit Switzerland.
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept A) I did live there.		B) My source is quoted directly from current Swiss gun laws. The link goes directly to the law. 		https://t.co/ZRporYj0I5 	Under “Current Gun Control Law - Acqusition of Firearms”		You’re wrong. You’re citing old militia gun regs.
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept “whereas fully automatic guns are banned”
@traviscim03 @GerrybombS @NRA @DCPoliceDept Homicides are not self-defense. Those are murders. CCW permits went up by 1440%, supposedly making DC residents more safe, yet the likelihood of being murdered increased by 46%. Those are facts.
@TheRicolaJingle @mar4lex @NRA @DCPoliceDept Wrong.		https://t.co/ZRporYj0I5		Not sure about Canada, but I lived in Switzerland. Much more common sense gun control laws there.

@posoem @CasiGmail @WilliamRt96 @krakkadooom @FoxNews You just keep saying more and more stupid things. The @NRA pays millions each year to politicians and represents gun and ammunition manufacturers. Ever heard of the NRA ILA?
@WilliamRt96 @posoem @CasiGmail @krakkadooom @FoxNews You are so stupid it is almost unbelievable. Why would I make up owning guns? If I’m an anti-gun liberal, wouldn’t I just say that guns are bad and I don’t have any?
@CasiGmail @krakkadooom @WilliamRt96 @FoxNews I like to see what kind of ignorant nonsense they’ll come up with next. 😉
@krakkadooom @WilliamRt96 @CasiGmail @FoxNews You #MAGAts have just given up on facts and reality, huh?
@MonicaCrowley @SheriffClarke @CNN @Acosta @realDonaldTrump Yeah, fuckin’ fearless. https://t.co/xzoHoRKNAE
@WilliamRt96 @CasiGmail @krakkadooom @FoxNews So we should run over people standing in the street? WTF is the matter with you #MAGAts?
@GOPChairwoman Yeah, it sucks when people count all the votes 🙄
@posoem @CasiGmail @WilliamRt96 @krakkadooom @FoxNews Is that a threat? 😂😂 Idiot.

@posoem @WilliamRt96 @CasiGmail @krakkadooom @FoxNews So you’re justifying murder. 👍
@WilliamRt96 @CasiGmail @krakkadooom @FoxNews Or sending bombs to people’s houses or running people over with their car...

@cologop Seems pretty obvious she initiated contact. It looks as if Acosta just brought his arm down when she grabbed his hand.
@PatriotNotPol #LoserSaysWhat 😂😂😂
@PressSec You know there’s video, right?
@trish_regan @mercedesschlapp Because walking up and grabbing things out of people’s hands without asking is acceptable behavior?
@NRA Right. How ridiculous that physicians would not consult firearm manufacturers about the effects of gunshot wounds.

@realDonaldTrump Dumbass, just because you don’t like it doesn’t make it false.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Thanks for so aptly demonstrating that politicians are only concerned with reelection, not with serving their constituents. Your father demonstrates this to an extent never seen before.
@realDonaldTrump Welcome to the next two years of getting nothing done. And, when the economy craps out, he’s going to blame that on Democrats.
@fev7777777 @uttppROD @POTUS Good for you, but there’s statistical data to show that you are the exception in that demographic rather than the standard.
@RNCResearch I bet they’d trade those Senate seats to keep the House.
@CMSmedile @HawleyMO Enjoy losing the House #MAGAt 👍
@LindseyGrahamSC I don’t think you know what a “fact” is. Also, the House results are much more indicative of voter sentiment.
@marcorubio Red wave? You’re losing the House.
@JohnCornyn And you’re losing 30+ House seats.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Did you not hear you’re losing the House?
@NRA @VoteMarsha The House got slightly less dipshitty.
@kayleighmcenany @jaketapper @CNN I’m hoping the @GOP holds the House and Senate so they’ll have to eat their own shit when the economy tanks. No one to blame but @realDonaldTrump. In 2020 we can try to start over.

@TishMorticia7 @akvawe66 @uttppROD I’m not sure why this is so complicated for you. You’ve got black people marching with guns and pro-Democrat signs and that’s apparently voter intimidation. But you say white Trump voters are not. Pretty clear what the one difference is.
@TishMorticia7 @gp9122 @uttppROD Right, THAT’S the difference. You’re pathetic. You better be off to your Klan meeting now. The good news is, your opinion in this matter is meaningless. https://t.co/2RUkg6rYdU

@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD https://t.co/8Y0aRgFG8p
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 I agree. I typically stay away from using the word “fact” when discussing my opinion.

@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD Later stalker. You can go ahead and unfollow me too.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 So what would be the resolution you are hoping for? Or are you just complaining?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 As I told your friend, what you perceive doesn’t matter. They are well within their legal and Constitutional rights. If they said or made any actions to use their fire arms against someone, that would be a different story.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD Fortunately, what you think does not matter. They are well within their legal and Constitutional rights. End of story.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 I’m not missing anything. The two of you are trying to place meaning on someone’s actions simply based on their political party. Until something illegal has happened, there’s nothing to be done.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD You appear to be confused as to the meaning of the Second Amendment and our Constitution. It applies to everyone. It’s because people have done something illegal, I would wholly support their arrest.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 There’s no point in citing a case where the charge was brandishing when these people are not brandishing a weapon. This is just political posturing.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 They are not brandishing a weapon. They’re carrying their weapons at rest. Completely legal.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD How is walking with a firearm at rest intimidation? And since when do I have to demonstrate the need for protection to carry a firearm?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 Then what’s your issue with them? That they’re supporting a Democrat? Or that you think they’re trying to intimidate people?
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD Well, you’re criticizing people for bearing arms legally...
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 Seems pretty clear that they’re excercising their Constitutional rights. Not sure why it’s got y’all so twisted up. Is it because they support a Democrat?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 So what’s your point? It looks like, to me, that they are legally expressing their right to bear arms, right?
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD So you oppose the #2A?
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 What it looks like to you or me doesn’t matter. They have the right to carry those arms. Period.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 It doesn’t matter what anyone thinks. #2A gives us the right to protect ourselves and, in some states, open carry. As long as they follow the law, it’s their right to carry their weapons.
@uttppROD @TishMorticia7 And? I open carry all the time and I’m not trying to “intimidate” anyone. It’s stupid to say a party supports the #2A, but only for their own party.
@TishMorticia7 @uttppROD So how is this intimidation vs. protection? Seems suspicious that they’re using a screenshot of a video rather than the actual footage 🤔 What’s the actual context?
@provdcrumblover @uttppROD Looks like open carry to me. I thought #MAGATs were pro #2A? Or is that only for white people?

@DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN So if they were trying to be sneaky about voter temperament, why would they share the fact that she’s his mom rather than cut the interview before she says her name? @DonaldJTrumpJr is #FakeNews and a #TrustFundBaby

@SarahPalinUSA I highly doubt that.
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @FoxFriendsFirst Oh now @kayleighmcenany practices Constitutional law? 😂😂
@SeemaCMS You seem pretty absolute for something that is theoretical. There are numerous ways in which a single-payer system could be implemented that would actually decrease costs. But that would cost profits for private insurance and pharmaceutical companies 😲
@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany 😂😂 Makes a dumb comment and then blocks me and deletes them. #MAGAts https://t.co/U5Rj1UZFxz
@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany The free market is what led to the issue of skyrocketing drug prices and private insurance premiums. There is no competition with pharmaceutical drugs due to patent restrictions.
@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany That’s not a factual response. Comparing the ACA to a single-payer system is incongruent. Repeating it does not make it real.
@GOPChairwoman State-run media is super creepy.
@Trina1732674 @kayleighmcenany Why don’t you try reading what I wrote and THEN responding. I’d love to see how you could factually contradict any of my points.
@kayleighmcenany Let’s see, the risk pool would be more diluted which would drive down costs. The federal government could bargain with providers and pharmaceutical companies to drive down prices. Increased access to preventative medicine would further decrease costs...
@SeemaCMS #NotWinning https://t.co/FI6nU7r7hH
@SeemaCMS The fact that in your position you are unable to even contemplate the possibility of some form of single-payer healthcare system is what’s truly scary.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I like how you don’t @ him since you’re a punk.
@realDonaldTrump Weren’t your kids born before Ivana became a US citizen?
@AntonioSabatoJr How about you “learn the language”? Your grammar is atrocious. Also, the US has no formal language. The Founding Fathers were intelligent and realized that immigration and diversity add to and strengthen our country.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Because Mexico is dangerous and they speak a different language. If @realDonaldTrump ends birthright citizenship, will you move to Czechoslovakia since your mother wasn’t a US citizen when you and your siblings were born?
@realDonaldTrump No, It’s you.

@SesslarMark @dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl Yeah, me too. And I donate money and time to multiple charities aimed at reducing poverty.
@SesslarMark @dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl You do realize that this many people enter our country illegally every week already, right? Probably not. What we need is immigration reform, but all our politicians do is talk.
@SesslarMark @dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl I’m sorry, are you housing homeless American citizens in your house?
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl @realDonaldTrump 1) There’s no wall and no immigration reform. @realDonaldTrump failed. 	2) Noncitizens are not voting in federal elections, the only elections in which citizenship is required. States/counties/cities are allowed to let whomever they like vote. 	3) Take care, you’re dull. https://t.co/6iO0ILSFVp
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl If @realDonaldTrump ever introduces an immigration bill that doesn’t hinge on wall funding, his claims that he wants immigration reform would be believable. And his own commission found no evidence to support his claims of noncitizens voting, so just give up that tired nonsense.
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl the penalties for illegal entry since it’s currently only a misdemeanor.
@dude_patriot @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl Volume of script? I pay my taxes. I’d rather have it go towards helping people fleeing violence than towards building a pointless wall. What I’d really like to see is immigration reform that makes the path to legal citizenship and immigration more reasonable while increasing...
@nwddebo @vjoycejkl You too 😂😂😂😂
@LauraLoomer @DonaldJTrumpJr It must be scary to live in a fantasy world.
@InFrontUS01 @DawnDavis64 @vjoycejkl What’s your point? Most educated people speak multiple languages. Diversity is a strength. Xenophobia is pathetic and ignorant.
@InFrontUS01 @DawnDavis64 @vjoycejkl And as I already let you know, that is a lie. Tell the truth or go away.
@DawnDavis64 @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl And if I were you, I wouldn’t be so quick to criticize anyone’s English language skills. https://t.co/fR5VW29aki
@DawnDavis64 @InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl You know the US has no official language, right? Because our Founding Fathers recognized that diversity is a strength. If they thought speaking English was so important, it would have been in the Constitution.
@BrokeGi2017 @vjoycejkl @uttppROD You should really learn how “welfare” benefits work.

@InFrontUS01 @vjoycejkl A) Your first point is a lie. Travel more.	B) There is no official language in the US	C) MOST American schools are so underfunded that they can’t afford to hire ESL teachers, so most monolingual Spanish-speaking students have to learn English on their own.	D) Xenophobia is gross
@Boo3zero5 @vjoycejkl I see where you’re going with this 😉 I work with all those groups. I deal with poverty issues at all levels. Vets are an important focus in that equation as are children, women, homeless, immigrants, etc.

@Boo3zero5 @vjoycejkl Another #MAGA genius 😂😂 I work with vets every day and help them with housing, health,and nutrition issues. It’s not all or nothing when it comes to having empathy and helping people.

@vjoycejkl Yes, it was nice of them, but people also have the basic human right to try and do what’s best for themselves and their families. Get off your dumbass anti-immigrant horse and find some fucking empathy for people who need help.
@vjoycejkl Nice try. I lived in Mexico for years. I’m well aware of the levels of violence and exploitation, especially against immigrants. Yes, Mexico can be a beautiful and wonderful country if you’re a local and/or have money.
@rolandscahill Because it’s all about money.
@briantylercohen @joncoopertweets It must be so difficult to have to salute that worthless piece of garbage.

@Millie__Weaver No, I’m still voting against anyone who supports @realDonaldTrump’s agenda.
@JohnCornyn We have Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, subsidized plans (ACA), and private insurance. How would you suggest we make the market more competitive? ACA coverage is optional already.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends I’ll still vote a mixed ticket, but I won’t vote for anyone who supports your disastrous agenda.
@PatriotNotPol Do you even believe what you say or is this just what you need to do to get @GOP support? Do they send you a script?
@larryelder @PatriotNotPol Yeah, pipe bombs are the same as words 🙄
@FoxNews 2 years and two miles of fence. Sure @realDonaldTrump, build your wall. By the time you’re out of office there might be 5 miles completed. It’ll be the monument to your failure.
@PalmerReport Here’s your problem, you assume “Trump supporters think”. At this point, they’re just walking, propaganda vomiting robots. There’s no genuine thought.
@washingtonpost @AnnCoulter and @rushlimbaugh are the new Alex Jones.
@BillOReilly Or if the @GOP organized it to take focus off the tumbling stock market, which would actually make sense (in the realm of conspiracy theories). In reality, it’s just safer to travel in a group.

@uttppROD @GOP @POTUS Most (on both sides) are not instigating or proposing violence, but I would say that anyone generating or propagating #FakeNews has played a significant part in actions like these.
@uttppROD This is infuriating. He’s no more a representative of the @GOP than the guy who shot Steve Scalise was of the Democrats. But everyone is either trying to say it’s the @GOP’s fault or it’s a false flag. IT WAS ONE CRAZY ASSHOLE and our @POTUS needs to tone down his violent rants.
@Cassidy1726 @SchlaflysCorpse @GreenET1832 @dannycarson4 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You realize you are just rattling off @GOP buzzwords when they go into defense mode. Are you a bot?

@Cassidy1726 @SchlaflysCorpse @GreenET1832 @dannycarson4 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Is there something unclear about sending live bombs to people’s houses?

@Cassidy1726 @SchlaflysCorpse @GreenET1832 @dannycarson4 @FoxNews He’s on Facebook at #MAGA rallies and has @realDonaldTrump stickers all over his van. He’s a registered Republican. There’s no “framing” anyone. This is what happens when you invent “mobs” that threaten someone’s way of life.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/12Qnk8202R
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @POTUS He also insinuated that Democrats sent the bombs to take attention off the Honduran migrants.
@AntonioSabatoJr https://t.co/jv9VTvhx0D
@DonaldJTrumpJr @TPUSA @realDonaldTrump What was that? 300 people?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Wasn’t it a book review?
@RealJamesWoods So you bang people who live under overpasses?
@bennyjohnson Baby powder and bombs are very different. Maybe you learn that at 4 months old.
@BrentScher @CNN Why would they say that? It’s definitely in part his fault.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump You mean the book review?
@DonaldJTrumpJr So by referring to it as white powder, we know that it was not harmful. So she got baby powder in her face that was meant for you.
@uttppROD @SurvivorKitty No one is failing to condemn the violent or threatening actions taken against anyone else, simply pointing out that there is a vast level of difference in severity between bombs and beans. Attempting to normalize these bombs is exactly what you’re condemning.
@uttppROD @SurvivorKitty Interesting you put beans in quotes but not ricin as if saying beans is somehow questionable when the fact is that it was beans, not ricin. You’re essentially saying that sending an threatening email is the same as putting a bomb in a school. Not the same regardless of intent.
@SurvivorKitty @uttppROD Yes, causing harm to anyone is bad. Sending viable bombs to people’s homes is much more severe than sending ground up beans. There is no comparison.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @PressSec Yes, that’s the travesty 🙄
@SurvivorKitty @uttppROD You’d need to eat pounds and pounds of castor beans to achieve a lethal dose of ricin which is synthesized from the oil. It was not any kind of danger to the recipients. Using multiple !! is akin to yelling online.
@SurvivorKitty @uttppROD They were Castor beans, not ricin. Ground up beans. And you’re the one yelling.
@uttppROD @SurvivorKitty You mean the Castor beans? It wasn’t synthesized into actual poison. They were ground up beans. 🙄
@uttppROD Empty buildings vs. attempted murder
@uttppROD No, not really. Yelling at McConnell is not the same as sending 10(?) people pipe bombs.
@uttppROD Broken windows are less severe than viable bombs. Period. Yes, it’s all awful, disgusting behavior which has unfortunately become the norm, but these attempted bombings are a significant escalation.
@uttppROD You’re better than this. Seriously.
@akvawe66 @uttppROD Well, considering the @GOP is in control of all 3 branches of the federal gov’t, I’d say it’s currently up to them. As of right now, illegal entry is a misdemeanor. Hence my suggestion of immigration reform.
@akvawe66 @uttppROD So you are advocating that the US should drop everything and focus ONLY on US gang violence? What about the opioid epidemic? Or illegal immigration? Or our exploding debt? Maybe we should put a little time towards immigration reform instead of just whining about it...🤔
@uttppROD He’s already attacking the media again, so that whole unity farce is pretty much out the window already. It makes for nice sound bites though.
@FoxNews @PressSec Lol. They’ve already got that dude in Gitmo. We’ll never hear who he was or see pictures of his bunker full of @realDonaldTrump shrines.
@SurrattPam @FoxNews A) Illegal entry is a misdemeanor. If they really cared, it’d be a felony.	B) More people enter the US illegally every 4 days than there are people in the “caravan”.	C) It’s mostly women and children fleeing one of the deadliest countries on earth.
@SurrattPam @FoxNews News update: The “caravan” is a bunch of people walking across an entire country. They’re about 10 miles closer than yesterday. Update complete.
@haakemom @FoxNews https://t.co/ul2yyX9lSF
@akvawe66 @uttppROD That’s not how averages and rates work. If that’s how you want to compare, the murder rate in Honduras is 12 times higher than that of the US. Honduras is one of the deadliest countries on the planet.
@akvawe66 @uttppROD I’m guessing the fact that the murder rate in Honduras is 3 times that of Chicago probably plays a part in the mass migration.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Each time you say something it is “the dumbest statement in the history of both politics and economics”.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Once again, you’ve failed miserably in your charge.
@NRA Taking this Citizens United Bot a little too far...
@SteveGuest @realDonaldTrump So when he offered to pay the legal fees of anyone attacking protesters at his rallies, that was...?
@SheriffClarke @cspan @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Stick to...I’m not sure what you do well, but it’s obviously not economics.
@ida_skibenes He already called them good people.
@Jordanfabian @PressSec Will he pay the legal fees once a suspect is detained?
So how long until the @GOP stops pretending to be horrified about these packages and starts saying it was #Antifa or Soros trying to sabotage the midterms?
@kayleighmcenany WTF? Y’all caused this by trying to scare people about some nonexistent mob.

@uttppROD While I am always hesitant to hand more power to the federal government, states simply do not have the power to take on private insurance and pharmaceutical companies whose predatory business practices are the sole cause of exploding health care costs.
@uttppROD The upsides:		1) Lower prescription drug prices	2) Huge savings to Medicare/Medicaid	3) Healthier population (also saves money)	4) Ability to cut taxes without increasing deficit and debt
@RichardGrenell Ever heard of Stalin?
@NRA @tedcruz There are a lot of other rights that @tedcruz doesn’t support.
@uttppROD We need Mexico (and other countries) to share more info with us so that we can conduct thorough background checks.		Instead of wasting money on a wall, why don’t we use technology from this millennium? Heat recognition in drones and chopper teams to intercept?
@uttppROD A) Common sense immigration reform (can you serve a productive purpose in our society)		B) Stronger laws against illegal entry (right now it’s charged as a misdemeanor, if at all).		C) Streamlined, nondiscriminatory process (cheap/free, quick, thorough)		D) Info sharing w/ Mexico
@RAMRANTS @uttppROD @Green_Footballs @fawfulfan Has his accuser released his name yet or filed a police report?
@uttppROD Our economy relies heavily on immigration for the service and agricultural sectors. Create a path for these workers to come here legally.
@uttppROD What border security reform has been proposed that doesn’t hinge on appropriating funds for the wall? The wall is idiotic. There are already tunnels under the wall. Give me an immigration reform bill that involves streamlining the process for legal immigration.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Probably people who don’t want other people to starve to death. So obviously not the @GOP.
@uttppROD Who is advocating “open borders”? Not wanting to waste money on a wall while ignoring comprehensive immigration reform is not advocating for open borders.
@uttppROD That’s just the VA’s stats, it doesn’t take into account veterans who are not in the VA system.
@GOPChairwoman What we really know is that anything you say is most definitely a lie.
@realDonaldTrump Hopefully it means you won’t be on the news anymore.
@realDonaldTrump You are such a piece of shit. Shameful.

@KatrinaPierson Yes. He should report this to the police where the incident occurred. I would think his lawyers should have told him that.

@FoxNews @DiamondandSilk I’d love to have anyone involved in this interview try to explain how coming here “the right way” actually works. Just one. Any one of them...
@KaitMarieox Because intruders are screaming as they pour into your home? A) Intruders are usually trying to be silent already. B) Maybe you should use your money to move into a better neighborhood rather than spending it on ridiculous “self defense” weapons.
@RealJamesWoods Almost, but not actually. Whereas @realDonaldTrump regularly leads mindless chants of “Lock her up” and “Make America Great Again” at his rallies, which we pay for, as he’s campaigning instead of doing his job.
@mojoman04 @CNN Indians are from India.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson You are aware that the @GOP controls all three branches of the federal government right now, right?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Good to know you don’t even bother to pretend to represent more than half the people in this country.

@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump Read Heller v. DC in its entirety. That’s the interpretation of the 2A I prescribe to. I don’t believe in any god and that’s my right. The only rights I care about are those granted by the Constitution. Stop trying to be condescending, it’s pathetic. Take care, you’re on mute.
@realDonaldTrump Remember when your family pretended to be Swedish? 😂😂
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump Anyone who believes that some god gives them rights over the written law of the land known as our Constitution is stupid. I stand by that. I also stand by their 1A right to practice their religion, but those rules do not supersede the Constitution. Take care Doug.
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump With your “law degree”, I’m surprised you weren’t aware that the defamation simply referred to Ms. Daniels’ claims that @realDonaldTrump’s statements were injurious to her character and reputation. It has nothing to do with her claims about their alleged affair.
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump That’s cute Douglas. Yes, I’m an actual lawyer, not just someone pretending to “have a law degree” on Twitter. I specialize in Constitutional Law. Awarding attorney’s fees is standard practice when frivolous suits are thrown out. It has nothing to do with Daniels’ claims.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Having jobs that cant be filled and stagnant wages is not a good thing.
@StarnesDouglas @SarahPalinUSA @realDonaldTrump When you have to preface your point with “basically”, you’re already wrong. People unfamiliar with the law try to read in their own opinions with the judge’s. All this judge said is they did not see @realDonaldTrump’s comments about Stormy Daniels as defamation.
@SeemaCMS So what are your solutions to combat rising health care and prescription costs? Cut funding and leave more people to fend for themselves? Yes, simply “giving” everyone Medicare is not the answer, but there many variations of the premise that could work.
@SarahPalinUSA It has nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump being right. It’s a defamation case. The case was regarding whether Trump defamed her or not.
@RepMullin @MichaelAvenatti @DonaldJTrumpJr So @MichaelAvenatti proposing a fight is ridiculous, but you doing the same thing is...?

It’s fun to mute #MAGA morons and let them go on ranting nonsense thinking they’re winning an argument.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Lol. Nice try. It says nothing about taxes. It also fails to account for the fact that these are jobs Americans don’t want and won’t do for the most part. Anyway, there’s no point arguing with someone who’s already made up their mind. Have a good night.
@RudyGiuliani You’re the one Tweeting the word “RAGE” in all caps, Rudy.
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse Except in Saudi Arabia...or Russia...or North Korea...
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Also, the whole point @RepAndyBiggsAZ is trying to make is that illegal immigrants are bad because they cost taxpayers money when, in fact, there is a net gain and the work done by illegal immigrants stimulates our economy and supports numerous industries.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Shit, sorry. Does the money not go to the feds? It gets credited to the account of the SSN being used. Regardless of which “account” it’s paid to, it’s still paid out to beneficiaries who are currently drawing from Social Security.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ In most cases, it’s deducted directly from their paychecks so they don’t even file taxes. The $12 billion is the net input. And like I said, the employers are typically the ones providing the false SSNs yet no one seems to care about that.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @RepAndyBiggsAZ Whomever’s their employer gives them in most cases. Either way, they can’t claim it so it’s actually helping the Social Security program.

@SCSmartass @uttppROD It obviously needed doing judging by your ridiculous reaction to my statement.
@SCSmartass @theDeathScarr @uttppROD If I understood the conversation? You replied to me. All I said is that Antifa is not representative of most people considered to be on the left. This caused you to lose your mind for some reason. There is such a thing as a moderate.
@theDeathScarr @SCSmartass @uttppROD Except I think anyone breaking the law should face the consequences. Y’all seem to think it’s just the “left” that needs punishment. Talk about facism 🙄

@GovMikeHuckabee Whereas, you could try to confirm a SCOTUS nominee who has been accused of sexual misconduct without bothering to look into the accusations at all. Lesson: ALL politicians put party over people.
@JohnCornyn That’s interesting. Do you have ANY proof or are you just talking shit? Don’t worry, it’s a rhetorical question.
@KatrinaPierson You need to learn the meaning of “due process”. Kavanaugh is not owed confirmation by virtue of his nomination. Each Senator has the duty to vote based on their belief regarding the nominee’s suitability for the position. It’s called “representative democracy”.
@CBNNews Keep your faith to yourself. That’s why it’s YOUR faith.
@uttppROD The philosophy of socialism, much like democracy, is virtuous in theory, but generally bastardized and abused when put into practice by greedy egoists known as politicians.

@AntonioSabatoJr @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Nobody is trying to bully or scare you. Nobody cares about you. You are irrelevant.
@AntonioSabatoJr Says the failed actor...
@kayleighmcenany You seem to forget the fact an investigation was conducted and he was cleared. That’s the same treatment Kavanaugh is receiving. He’s just in the news more because he is up for a position on the SCOTUS rather than a state AG.
@GuyGriesmann @NRA Right. Obviously. So why bother? It’s just a publicity stunt. If the @NRA cares about school security, why don’t they donate some of their billions to schools to pay for better security? Start a grant program.
@NRA Superintendents are actually in schools very rarely. Most of their time is spent in meetings out in the community.
@KatrinaPierson You mean AFTER the investigation was conducted and no evidence was found, they cleared him? Crazy 🙄
@CB68spc @NRA International sales of small arms and light weapons that aren’t legal in the US account for billions of dollars of revenue annually, much more than the US market. I tend to think people will go for money over morality most of the time. Sad but true.
@CB68spc @NRA You’re commenting on an NRA thread on Twitter. The government knows you have guns. Also, the US does not have to sign on to the treaty. The only reason to sink the treaty is profits. Anyway, thanks for at least bothering to look over it. Have a good night.

@CB68spc @NRA https://t.co/HeSPPZnjl5 		The @NRA lobbied particularly hard against these treaties. Land mines passed no problem, SALWs not so much.
@CB68spc @NRA Are they having trouble selling their wares? No. But the @NRA works outside of the US to influence policy that leads to more weapons in war zones. That’s where the real money is and it’s not in America. Hard to defend the #2A in countries without one.
@CB68spc @NRA Is the Elmer Fudd thing something the Russian bots came up with or did you @NRA dipshits have a little clan meeting about it? You’re the third one of you that’s called me that. I absolutely support the #2A. The @NRA supports profits for firearm and ammunition manufacturers.

@CoolHandLuke124 @mdobbs1316 @Liz_Cheney Sorry, I had two of you bots replying on the same thread. I guess your handlers didn’t coordinate well. You hire lawyers because you are not an expert in the law. I’m sure you’re good at things too, like speaking Russian. 😂 And yes, you’re still wrong. Filing a suit is easy.
@SpeakerRyan A trilateral trade agreement...	That sounds familiar...	What are they going to call it?
@LindseyGrahamSC I’d respond with a defamation suit. But I’d be innocent, so that’s why I’d do what makes sense when falsely accused. I guess that’s not common knowledge for a...judge. 🤔
@DonaldJTrumpJr Your father is a draft dodger. Nuff said. Sit down Baby Bone Spurs.
@NRA I love America, I’m a hunter and gun owner, and I despise the @NRA.
@KatrinaPierson This is why party loyalty is stupid. Yes, the Republican Party was different 50 years ago and did great things. That has changed. Vote based on a candidates actions, not party.
@KatrinaPierson Are you accusing @SenBooker of this crime @KatrinaPierson? Should we loop the @FBI in on this?

@GOP @mercedesschlapp But it’s totally cool to belittle a woman who’s dedicated her life to teaching, right?
@SteveGuest @kayleighmcenany Considering it IS happening while the @GOP holds all the power, this statement is simply idiotic.

@senorrinhatch Y’all fought tooth and nail to avoid either a hearing or an investigation.
@Liz_Cheney He’s a SCOTUS nominee. They need to be held to higher standards. We can vote Feinstein out; Kavanaugh is up for a lifetime appointment.
@NRA Any evidence to correlate those two pieces of information?
@KatrinaPierson It’ll be interesting to see what she tells the FBI.
@AntonioSabatoJr @FBI @HillaryClinton @BarackObama For what? Are you making false accusations @AntonioSabatoJr? Good thing you were stupid enough to loop the @FBI in on it from the get-go.
@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney Have I advocated for Kavanaugh to resign? No. Do I support investigations into the accusations against both Kavanaugh and Ellison? Yes. Is that happening? Yes. I’ve not seen anything about Booker and I was 16 when Clinton was in office. Stop being stupid.
@carysimond @uttppROD https://t.co/tzVO7qYkfL
@DavidAFrench FFS, nothing is black and white. If you’re falsely accused, you have legal recourse. They can be charged with filing a false report or defamation. The only reason not to utilize these routes is if you are guilty, because they do demand an investigation.
@newtgingrich Did he finally take his Xanax? Wouldn’t want him stroking out in rage while defends men’s rights to molest women.
@RealCandaceO @kanyewest Does he have anyone to corroborate his accusations?
@GOP @PressSec That’s like calling someone disgusting for sneezing next to the salad bar as you piss in the soup.
@AntonioSabatoJr @jack You can have a liberal bias or be liberally biased, but I don’t think that you can actually be a liberal bias. Also, you’re whining about censorship as you freely post on their private platform.
@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney Are you insane? No one is talking about abortion. And if you mention political party when discussing the SCOTUS, you’ve already lost the idea behind this legal body which is supposed to rise above partisan politics. Another reason why Kavanaugh is unfit for the Court.
@AntonioSabatoJr You’re not even well-known in your first profession. Losing your election will simply twice confirm your irrelevance.

@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney P.S. Bank*bot, in what sense is Kavanaugh not receiving due process? Please detail that.
@CoolHandLuke124 @Liz_Cheney Well, it bears enough weight for an FBI investigation. And if I were accused and I knew it to be false allegations, I would bring a defamation suit against my accuser and sue them into bankruptcy. Why hasn’t Kavanaugh done that? Right, that requires an investigation.

@DaniForAmerica @uttppROD https://t.co/2ZARg7iQHm
@LauraLoomer @uttppROD @keithellison @doug_wardlow @KarenMonahan01 So a MN AG who hurts women is unacceptable, but a SCOTUS Justice who molests them is cool? Personally, I’d say neither is fit for office.
@TheJordanRachel @uttppROD It’s kind of WEIRD no one attacks men for reporting sexual abuse by priests that happened 40 or more years ago.
@Liz_Cheney Right. It’s much better to teach girls any women not to speak up about sexual abuse because they will be disbelieved and ridiculed. You all don’t even know what due process means. Kavanaugh is getting due process right now.
@AntonioSabatoJr You’re not even going to arrive, loser.
@SteveKingIA So you have a lot of experience dealing with the emotional aftermath of sexual assault? You sure seem willing to comment on how WOMEN who’ve experienced this SHOULD process the event(s).
@RolloofRosslyn @RepMattGaetz I see English comprehension is not your strong suit. Me first what?
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Serious accusations were made. An investigation is being conducted to ascertain the available facts. A judge should understand and agree with this process.
@Conservativeind That’s one of the more ignorant statements I’ve seen today.
@Mikejon88233155 @uttppROD @realDonaldTrump It helps if they don’t start out that way. Also, term limits. And a ban from lobbying after leaving office. We also need campaign finance reform and a reversal of Citizens United.
@WalshFreedom @AP4Liberty It should be more popular. Not sure why the @GOP is fighting it so hard.
@LibertyCliff @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake Well, there’s always the enormous budget deficit we’ll see next year.
@uttppROD @realDonaldTrump We need politicians who aren’t politicians: teachers, business owners, farmers. People who’ve worked for a living and aren’t beholden to corporations or lobbyists.

@KatrinaPierson You are just an absolutely horrendous person.
@ErikFritts75 @TheAmadisKay @LindseyGrahamSC Interesting how no one questions the accusations against priests who molested children, sometimes more than 50 years ago. It’s as if it only makes a difference here because of politics...🤔
@kayleighmcenany Why not? Seriously?
@JohnCornyn You’re all crooks. The @GOP doesn’t care about the accusations and the Dems wouldn’t vote for any Justice nominated by the GOP. Most Americans just want to be sure our next SCOTUS isn’t a molester.
@uttppROD It would be a shame to learn that these allegations were false. I think that seems unlikely. The probability is that it will have been too long to find any definitive evidence and the nomination will move forward.
@pastormarkburns Rarely do I agree with you, but in this belief we concur.
@RepMattGaetz Right. The ABA and even Dershowitz say we need to delay, but we should trust you jackals (politicians)? GTFOH
@uttppROD If they come back with information backing him, he’ll get confirmed. I’m not sure why this is such a problem. The only way this hurts Kavanaugh is if the FBI finds factual evidence against him.
Let’s just get this off to a start... 	#ImpeachKavanaugh
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC You will go down in history as a partisan fraud. The @GOP will lose power and Kavanaugh will be impeached. When the ABA and even @AlanDersh says you should postpone, you political hacks should listen up.
@katshouse85 @AntonioSabatoJr You don’t even know the meaning of intuitive, do you? Sad. Intuition has nothing to do with my assessment of @AntonioSabatoJr’s intelligence, or lack thereof, and his definite upcoming defeat. Go back to your thesaurus.
@KimStrassel Even Dershowitz says they need to postpone.
@uttppROD Even Dershowitz says they need to postpone for an investigation. Kavanaugh is going to end up getting impeached. They’re never going to stop going after him and there’s obviously dirt somewhere.
@AntonioSabatoJr *You’re an idiot and are going to lose your election.
@RudyGiuliani You seem to forget our representatives should represent their constituents, not their party.
@uttppROD Did you see the ABA is petitioning the Senate to delay the hearings until an investigation has been completed?
@SenBobCorker @senorrinhatch @SenBobCorker why can’t the hearing process be put on hold while an investigation is conducted? It was alright to leave the Court with only 8 Justices for a year when the @GOP simply wanted to steal the nomination. An investigation would only take 2-3 weeks.
America lost today. Our politicians are clowns. The world is laughing (sadly) at us. #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
@RealOmarNavarro @PressGop @Alyssa_Milano Rumor has it you’re running for office. Have fun losing.
@FoxNews If you want due process, ask for an investigation. I thought you were a judge?
@uttppROD Too much emotion for a SCOTUS Justice. He doesn’t have the temperament. That man has rage issues.
@RealOmarNavarro You are nothing.
@kayleighmcenany You are absolutely insane.
@kayleighmcenany You’re quoting Joe Biden. That’s how you know the @GOP is lost, @FoxNews entertainers like @kayleighmcenany are quoting Joe Biden.
@Tlross12Theresa @FoxNews Google translate seems to be off. 😂
@DLoesch You act as if you KNOW the truth. It’s just ignorant. Put the nomination on hold, conduct an actual investigation, then proceed. It’s not complicated and there’s no sense of urgency for a nomination. We went a full year with just 8 Justices not so long ago.
@NRA The SCOTUS protects our #2A rights, not a lobbying firm like the @NRA.
@GOP @PressSec How about you just come out and say it then? State unequivocally that Ford is a liar. Instead you insinuate to cover your ass. It’s pathetic.
@GOP Y’all should back away from this train wreck ASAP. @realDonaldTrump has already started hedging his bets.
@LouisvilleGun @Snowflakemeltor @dcr999 @NRA I’m not saying that’s not the case. We won’t know until there is a law banning AR-15s, or some similar law, that is challenged in court. It’s all hypothetical. That’s why we have a justice system rather the governance via Twitter. Have a nice day.
@LouisvilleGun @Snowflakemeltor @dcr999 @NRA That has been extended to fully-automatic weapons as well. It’s not up to you or I to decide what constitutes a weapon “not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.” That’s up to the courts who should use reliable data to reach a decision.
@LouisvilleGun @Snowflakemeltor @dcr999 @NRA The language reads, “We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, like short-barreled shotguns.”
@DonaldJTrumpJr You really did not have to clarify that you are not a psychology professor. Nobody thought that. Nobody.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Scalia himself agreed that certain weapons that pose a great risk to the general public must be controlled. Many firearms are currently illegal for public possession. I agree with that assessment. Im not saying their “should” be an “AR ban”. Research is needed.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @Devildorff @uttppROD Kavanaugh has the means. He could start a GoFundMe if not (he certainly seems to have a lot of supporters). The idea that your “solution” is to immediately disbelieve people who come forward with claims of sexual abuse is abhorrent.
@Jim_Jordan How about you act like decent people?
@charliekirk11 @AntonioSabatoJr Standing for truth would mean calling for an investigation.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So Ford accusing Kavanaugh seems suspicious to you, but two guys admitting to a crime that they were not accused of is legit? I guess growing up Trump leads to a skewed view of reality.
@GOPChairwoman I good public image does not preclude someone from committing heinous acts against individuals, it actually enables them in many cases. Look at Bill Cosby, “America’s Dad”.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA of firearm owned. Magazines and other gun parts are not “arms” either in the historical or conventional sense. As an originalist, Justice Scalia would undoubtedly support that interpretation.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Because I can read and think. The decision in Heller was very clear in that the state and federal government cannot dictate in what state you possess a firearm within your own home. However, there is no question that there can be limitations to the type...1/2
@realDonaldTrump His accusations against you were true by your own admission...🤔
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I agree with Justice Scalia’s interpretation of the 2nd Amendment from Heller v. DC.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I practice Constitutional law, but thanks for your insight.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Doesn’t matter how I, or you, feel about eminent domain, it happens regardless. Hence “eminent”. We have the mag limit too. We just ignore it. Most of the Sherrifs in the State refused to enforce it.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Sure. I don’t NEED them. I like them, but they’re just for fun. I’d need to be reimbursed of course.
@uttppROD It’s only appropriate if the accusations are false. That’s what leads me to question the entire situation. While the details from the accusers, to the public’s general knowledge, appear vague, the accused seems hesitant to bring suit. Why?
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Oh the dread! I live in a state where I can legally open carry or carry concealed, own fully automatic firearms, and have a “Make My Day” law. How restrictive! GTFOH whack job. Btw, how are you “fighting”? Twitter warrior 😂 https://t.co/f8SOhjN07B
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA And can I still buy a 20 round mag in almost any gun store in CO? Absolutely. Take off your tin foil hat. Like I said, when we’ve got legislation introduced, I’ll take action. But I’m not giving money to the @NRA. Take care.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Good luck with that.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Also, I have a shotgun in my office. We have open carry here in Colorado. Much like with marijuana laws, our state would ignore federal law if it impeded our right to carry weapons.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA This is a stupid conversation. Is no legislation introduced to restrict our ability to own firearms. I’ll worry about it when it’s a problem. I’m certainly not giving one damn dime to the @NRA to pay for asshole politicians with an A rating and F-level intelligence. Take care.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA By out in the boonies do you mean a location where the majority of the population owns firearms and there are high levels of crime due to opioid addiction? Oh yeah, and bears.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I can and have protected myself with a shotgun.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Lol. I’ve got no problems. I’ve got a very definite line: I don’t care about handguns and semi automatic rifles, but come after my hunting weapons and we’ll have a problem.
@Snowflakemeltor @LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I own 6 ARs.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA I use my .243 for small game. The fact is even Scalia recognized the right of the federal government to restrict access to certain kinds of firearms for the protection of the public. Until some insane person starts trying to ban hunting rifles and shotguns, I’m out.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA Who exactly is calling to ban hunting weapons? And no, AR platforms are not hunting weapons.
@LouisvilleGun @dcr999 @NRA It’s called bow hunting. I get an elk, deer, and antelope almost every year with my bow.
@NRA I bow hunt too.
@KatrinaPierson @ChuckGrassley @SenateMajLdr Or, someone being falsely accused would immediately bring a defamation suit against their accusers...you know, if they were innocent.
@BetoORourke Don’t chase him out of restaurants, vote him out of office.
The WORLD laughs at your BS @realDonaldTrump. You are an embarrassment. https://t.co/AsrCwh4jsZ
@cologop @jaredpolis https://t.co/h3VinIBE7G
@Devildorff @uttppROD I would bring a defamation suit against my accusers. That’s what an innocent person would do.
@uttppROD What I find interesting is that all of these guys deny the claims yet not one has brought a defamation suit against their accusers. That would be step 1 for an innocent person.
@AntonioSabatoJr @realDonaldTrump JFC, did he really say some dumb shit like that? 🤦🏻‍♂️
@kayleighmcenany Well, they are investigating Ellison. Let’s do the same with Kavanaugh.
@mitchellvii You want to talk about what God expects from people?
@FoxNews @newtgingrich @FoxNewsOpinion It’s supposed to be the People.
@RepDaveWilliams He pushed her away after she hit him while she was trying to steal company property. Did you think no one would read the report?
@jeffhunt @PolisForCO If he’d have shot her in commission of a crime in his place of business after she assaulted him, he’d probably have gotten an A rating from the NRA and stolen some @GOP votes.
@DLoesch Sure. The difference is we have a say (vote) about whether Beto takes office for 6 years whereas 100 people get to decide if Kavanaugh gets a lifetime, and infinitely more influential, appointment.
@kayleighmcenany You. Absolutely you.
@DanielRand34744 @NRA There’s no evidence to suggest that I’m incorrect in my estimations. If the @NRA wants to claim they have 6 million members, they should prove it. Bye Bot.
@FoxNews https://t.co/rbcdTKzgpq
@KristySwansonXO @POTUS Well, you’re criticizing a group of people for dirty politicking and lies. Seems like it goes both ways. Our @POTUS is the most obvious example: he regularly lies, he cheats on his wives, he commits fraud...
@KristySwansonXO You are aware of who is @POTUS right now, right?
@charliekirk11 So the rich are bad Charlie?
@DanielRand34744 @NRA You’ve been on Twitter for more than a year, have 7 followers, and a bunch of random numbers in your handle. You’re a bot.
@TomiLahren Tomi Lahren: Attempts punching above her weight because she’s desperate for attention.		You sit down @TomiLahren. You’re a vapid talking head who will be forgotten along with all the other trash @FoxNews entertainers once this little experiment in misgovernment is over.
@DanielRand34744 @NRA You realize that makes their membership claims unsubstantiated as well, right? 😉🤔 Good night Bot. Or is it morning in Moscow?
It’s funny that the #MAGA crowd is always whining about Twitter silencing them, they pretty much choke out my Twitter feed. It’s impossible to avoid their #FakeNews
@FoxNews @marthamaccallum Which may very well be your perception of the events. However, both sides deserve to be heard. I’m pretty sure, I don’t know, a judge would agree with that statement.
@GOP @SenateMajLdr So you want to protect the accusers’ anonymity while simultaneously calling them liars?
I don’t get it. Why is it such a big deal to press pause on the confirmation process to make sure we’re not putting a serial molester on the SCOTUS for life? #KavanaughHearings
@DanielRand34744 @NRA It would be hard to support my claim since they won’t release their membership roles. Voter records, on the other hand, are public records. So we can factually verify that your claim is bullshit. 👍😉
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash “If”. And yes, I have a law degree. Due Process would be applicable IF Kavanaugh experienced any loss or was deprived of the right to Due Process. None of those things have happened. Stop being insane. It’s a delay, not a withdrawal of the nomination. Goodbye.
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash Unlike you, I’ve read the Constitution and studied law. Quoting something you don’t understand does not strengthen your argument. How would delaying the confirmation to investigate these claims deprive Kavanaugh of anything? This does not involved due process, there’s no charges.
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash You can’t simply imply “rights” when you don’t like a process. That’s not how rights work, they are extremely specific. Your reference to Feinstein’s letter, if false as you claim, would fall under protection by laws (libel, false accusations), not the BOR.
What? Undeniable that there will be only one opinion on something that will happen in the future? https://t.co/OuUp092RjH
RT @MedicVet68: Ted CRUZ is ripping WILLIE NELSON for his support of BETO, I say WILLIE is more popular and likable than CRUZ will ever be,…
@GeorgePapa19 Look who wants to be a part of things now...
@Jim_Jordan Never forget, our @POTUS cheated on multiple wives, bragged about groping women, lied about paying off a porn star, looted our coffers to give the ultra-rich a tax break, and lies ALL the time. And almost everyone in the @GOP is complicit.
@charliekirk11 Ellison is under investigation.
@cjcatz4618 @staceydash The Equal Protection Clause? How does that apply to this scenario? No legal action is being taken against Kavanaugh. Simply asking for an investigation and delay of confirmation does not deprive him of any rights.
@senorrinhatch Yes, TIMING is the problem. FFS 🤦🏻‍♂️
@GOP @nikkihaley But we can’t look at pharmaceutical companies. Seriously. There’s absolutely no way they’re involved. Absolutely no way... https://t.co/8dmZre7pRE
@SteveScalise Really? I’m pretty sure they’re asking to pause the confirmation process to thoroughly evaluate claims of sexual assault against a SCOTUS nominee. That’s not partisan, it’s just expected.

@FoxNews you need to reign in your minions. https://t.co/4H7XhoGGLJ
@AntonioSabatoJr How much longer until you lose your election and you can go back to being a D-list TV personality?
@staceydash Constitution is capitalized when referring to our specific Constitution. And exactly which portion of the Constitution are you referencing? Wait, was it just a buzzword?
@DanielRand34744 @NRA Right. Open public records are sooo much more questionable than unsupported claims by a partisan lobbying organization. 👍
@NRA I would LOVE to see your membership roles to see how many of the “6 million” are: dead, felons, or gift memberships for people who are unaware of them. My guess: 20% or more.
@staceydash You’re an idiot. To think a man as substantial as Barack Obama, regardless of political leaning, is impotent shows your ignorance. GTFOH Dionne.
@PatriotNotPol @AnnCoulter It’s Kavanaugh. Dumbass.
@AnnCoulter Is this a summation of your career?
@DLoesch Evidence? Jesus Christ 🤦🏻‍♂️
@charliekirk11 Why are you so opposed to hearing this person’s story? You don’t know who’s telling the truth. We waited a year for Scalia’s replacement, we can wait a week or two on Kavanaugh. I say they both take polygraphs.
@KatrinaPierson It’s so nice that you’re irrelevant.
@GOPChairwoman What’s wrong with eliminating private insurance? We can’t afford it anyway. Medicare is already administered by the federal government and is doomed. The $32 billion figure depends on current costs. In reality, single payer would drive down costs exponentially.
@charliekirk11 You were saying... https://t.co/YNufTqWrcr
@NRA @MikeBloomberg It must be hard to live in constant fear of imaginary threats.
@KatrinaPierson Lots of things are possible. Probable is another story. But it’s cute/pathetic how you two knobs are trying to spin this. The desperation is palpable.
@staceydash For the tenth time, this is a parody account you keep retweeting. You look like an idiot. Sorry, you ARE an idiot.
@KatrinaPierson Riiiiggghhhttt..... https://t.co/n51gD8wuYV
@realDonaldTrump Probably because the @GOP is trying to continue to rush the confirmation. By not involving the @FBI, they can keep the matter as a “he said, she said” incident rather the allowing the FBI to interview multiple witnesses and formally investigate what happened.
@GOPChairwoman Yes, the problem is how the information came to light, not the information itself. 🙄
@SheriffClarke Because a border wall is stupid. The @GOP knows this.
@DarkDanian @MagnusonThad @staceydash If you can’t have a discussion without mentioning political party, you’ve got a weak argument. Poverty in the US is not created by politics. It exists regardless of who is in the WH. Also, when I lived in Venezuela in 2008, they were very happy with “socialism”.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump That you make shit up.
If you’re going to talk politics, try and do it without using the words “Republican” or “Democrat” or any variation of either.

@kayleighmcenany @PressSec She lies every single day without regret. That’s not a good Christian.
@MagnusonThad @staceydash Thanks Thad. I’ve spent a lot of time in Venezuela. I’m aware of the conditions. My point is that we have similar, though less extreme, problems here at home that are ignored by our Administration.
@kelliwardaz Fail
@marcorubio You know we’ve got plenty of food insecurity right here in the U.S. In fact, thousands of Floridian children go to sleep hungry while @realDonaldTrump feasts at Mar A Lago on the taxpayer’s dime.

@staceydash No, she won the popular vote. You know, more people voted for her than @realDonaldTrump.
@staceydash And you don’t think that happens in the U.S. while Trump pigs out at Mar A Lago on the taxpayer’s dime? Wake up.
@staceydash You keep retweeting this parody account. You realize it’s a joke account, right? You know jokes, like your run for office. 😂😂
@GOPChairwoman Not if he molested/assaulted someone.

@DLoesch Mechanically, they’re no different. However, it is an obvious and indisputable fact that AR-15 platforms have become the weapon of choice of mass shooters. It’s worth looking into.
@KatrinaPierson So you’re saying that political candidates should worry more about what special interest groups think than the voters?
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @dbongino You see how these @FoxNews faux-journalists pose their accusations as questions to avoid being guilty of slander. Ah yes, the Logan Act. Written in the 1700s and utilized twice in the 1800s with no convictions. Very relevant.
@realDonaldTrump A) Prove it’s illegal.	B) Prove Clinton colluded.	C) Which laws prevent Mueller from investigating you?

@Michael46357324 @paKTusa @GaDawgforTrump @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Is it morning in Moscow? Please “Michael”, show me where I have advocated for Trump to be impeached? I think it’s a horrible idea. Pence is even worse than Trump. If moves were made to impeach the @POTUS, there would have to be evidence and a conviction of a felony in a court.
@KatrinaPierson @Google Don’t use their private platform then. “Oh no, this ____ tastes like shit. I’m going to make the company make it taste better.” Or...don’t buy the shit-tasting ____ .

@kayleighmcenany Disagreeing with you is not “blindly opposed”. It took years to get him confirmed to his last position. There’s no doubt he’s accomplished, but they are trying to rush the confirmation. There’s no hurry.
@Michael46357324 @paKTusa @GaDawgforTrump @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Come on and try it Comrade. It’s a long flight from Moscow. Also, you’re showing your (dumb) ass again, anyone with cash can buy property in the US.
@Michael46357324 @paKTusa @GaDawgforTrump @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Did they not teach you at Moscow U that the US Constitution protects its citizens from false imprisonment?

@GaDawgforTrump @SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Before you talk about the Constitution, you should try actually reading it. You MAGAts are so ignorant. They can’t “impeach him out of nowhere”. It’s an act of Congress for crimes committed while in office.

@RealJamesWoods @DonaldJTrumpJr How is it that nobody can understand the difference between “conspiracy theories surrounding Benghazi“ and saying Benghazi was a conspiracy? Those are two very different things. The GOP did spread conspiracy theories. Their investigation revealed nothing.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He clearly said “conspiracy theories surrounding Benghazi”, not that Benghazi was a conspiracy. Remember the conspiracy theories your dipshit father spread about Obama‘s birth certificate? Stuff like that.
@staceydash It would probably help if people could read. There’s a big difference between saying something was a conspiracy and pointing out that there are lots of conspiracy theories about Benghazi. Can’t fix stupid.

@mvpschief @NRA @OliverLNorth Interesting that you somehow have access to the ILA’s financial records since they don’t release them.

@mvpschief @NRA @OliverLNorth This whole debate is ridiculous. You can be pro-2A and anti-@NRA. I own dozens of firearms and have been a lifelong hunter.

@nyc4trump21 @BothSquared @UTexas_Allie @gbbofan @glib49 @Boogerqwn @AP Why? So you can deflect? If green people statistically commit more crimes, does that mean police are justified in shooting more unarmed green people? Don’t play dumb.

@FoxNews Our failing education system, repressed racism, and lack of personal responsibility are why @realDonaldTrump is @POTUS.
@VP @POTUS Is it hard to see his face with your lips plastered to his ass?

@larryelder @uttppROD Good job harassing a clerk who was just doing her job. Point well made.
@FoxNews How is this “news”? It was on FB a year ago.
@realDonaldTrump That’s great. Too bad you’re destroying the gains with your tax cuts for the rich. Once those losses are realized in next year’s budget, we’re screwed.
@FoxNews I have never seen the bar for success set so low. White privilege in action.
@SarahPalinUSA Did that dumbass just say coal is the best source of fuel because you can’t blow it up? Does he understand that coal doesn’t just magically create power? Probably not...
@realDonaldTrump That’s how trade works dumbass. We are consumers, China is producers. You need to incentivize the purchase of more expensive goods or no one will buy them.
@FoxNews What’s absurd are all these idiots trying to pretend economic growth started with @realDonaldTrump.
@thejtlewis That’s not a good thing.
@RealJamesWoods So what’s the answer? State control of private corporations? Sounds like socialism to me.
@charliekirk11 You realized that it’s public record that no President in history has lied more than @realDonaldTrump, right?
@realDonaldTrump But they’re not. So the American people lose out on a cost effective and fuel efficient vehicle that would be very helpful for low income individuals and families. You’re an idiot.
@KatiePavlich The wage gap and conviction rates are scientific data that contradicts your baseless assertion.

@RepDaveWilliams Y’all are halfway through his term with a hard midterm season coming up and major budgetary shortfalls from tax cuts coming out next year. There’s no wall.
@SeemaCMS @chiproytx So how about a solution? You Trumpers are great at complaining about programs, not strong on the solutions though.
@GovMikeHuckabee Says the guy referring to an imaginary story...
@charliekirk11 You can love your country and hate your government.
@RepDaveWilliams That’s because it has no bearing on the SCOTUS decision in Roe.
@KatrinaPierson It’s terrifying that someone as uninformed and ignorant as you is a Senior Advisor to the @POTUS.
@JamesHoulihan @SeemaCMS “Medicare for all” cuts out extortionist insurance companies, simplifies the system (drops admin costs), and solidifies the power to dictate reasonable prices to pharmaceutical companies (further decreasing costs).
@JamesHoulihan @SeemaCMS The major healthcare related costs that have grown exponentially in the last 40 years are: pharmaceuticals, insurance, and administrative. Two of these are private sectors that have grown unchecked and the other is a response to an overcomplicated system.
@thehill So he paid Nike full wholesale price for their goods and is now selling them extra-fast at a loss? These Trump idiots really don’t understand how a boycott works.
WTF?!?! https://t.co/yvuVGmAiDT
@JamesHoulihan @SeemaCMS Look who’s still creeping. Hadn’t heard from you in a while. Our rising healthcare costs cannot be solved by a fractured system. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries are too powerful to be opposed by anything other than the government.
@SeemaCMS Really? Or would it help drive down administrative, procedural, and pharmaceutical costs which would increase savings?
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump You shouldn’t refer folks to a dictionary when you obviously don’t understand the words you are using. @realDonaldTrump is “elite” and a Republican cutting taxes to benefit the rich is “status quo”.
@DonaldJTrumpJr This coming from a Trump 😂

@GOP when the full realization of the budgetary shortfall is realized from the tax cuts. 2/2
@GOP Being at full employment with stagnant wage growth is not a good economic indicator. It shows the truth: the rich have gotten richer from the tax cuts and the rest of us are staying about even (inflation eating our “tax savings”). The recession is going to hit hard next year 1/2
@uttppROD I thought they were going to “repeal” the ACA on Day 1...

@realDonaldTrump Your approval rating has never neared 50%. Therefore, nowhere near “almost everyone” agrees with this statement.
@GOPChairwoman Well, your candidate never stopped campaigning, so I guess they’re just playing catch-up.
@GOPChairwoman Or you don’t want to have the @POTUS tweeting nonstop about how you’re a liar and waiting 5-6 months to find out @POTUS is the liar and clearing your name. Right @StormyDaniels?

@GOPChairwoman Ted Cruz didn’t address the issue at hand (appointment of a new SCOTUS Justice), he just whined about Democrats. This hearing is a damn joke, both sides. We (America) look like chumps.
These people are not bright... https://t.co/7q6YdSgm9U
@sclancy79 @NFL @Nike Pssst...you already bought the shoes so you’re just burning your own money.
@tedcruz, you know that this is a SCOTUS hearing, not your podium to bitch about Democrats, right?
@uttppROD People seem to be losing their shit over it. It’s ridiculous.
@uttppROD So why is this an issue?
@uttppROD If anyone makes any move to outlaw kneeling before the flag, I would certainly begin doing so openly and proudly as a true American standing against oppression. Until that day, the whole point is moot as it’s just a bunch of people bitching about a nonstarter.
@uttppROD Define “respect”. I’d certainly kneel before the flag if it served my purpose in protesting an injustice. I’m not sure what situation would call for that, but I put the Constitution before any symbol.
@uttppROD I didn’t ever say I’d leave, but I support people’s right to express themselves and protest. I don’t give a shit about Hollywood movies misrepresenting history because I read and study history. Should I be “moved out” then?
@uttppROD that’s a different story.
@uttppROD The root of the issue is that it is only an opinion that people are “disrespecting” the flag. Even if it is disrespectful, the right to expression and free speech certainly supersede any unwritten guidelines about a symbol. If their employer forbids it during work hours,...
@uttppROD How so?
@uttppROD So the quasi-threats to people who don’t concur with your view of the American flag are...? Fact that it is a symbol means it does not actually represent our country. That’s why we have a constitution.
@uttppROD So you don’t believe in the right to freedom of expression?
@KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump A trust fund baby buying his way into the presidency isn’t really an inspiring story.
@GOP It’s clear he’s the only pick, not necessarily the right pick.
@TomiLahren You are a god damned idiot.

@uttppROD Charlie Kirk is just spreading false rhetoric. Abortions are not funded by taxpayer dollars (Title X funds expressly exclude abortion). Abortions are funded by donations and private pay. Any money he’s paid for abortions was by choice.
@uttppROD What’s wrong with sex if both parties are approaching it safely and consensually?
@uttppROD Since the dawn of time, the attempts to enforce abstinence have been entirely futile. Teaching people about the consequences of sex, on the other hand, and giving them access to birth control has produced measurable results.
@charliekirk11 Are you confused about how abortion funding works? It’s not funded by the feds (Title X), it’s funded by donations and private pay. So any money you pay for abortion is your choice.
@SteveKingIA You are a piss-poor excuse for a human being.

@PaulAMarketos @staceydash The fact is that neither Trump nor Clinton are fit to lead this country. Unfortunately, they were our only choices. Take care.
@PaulAMarketos @staceydash Be Better? Lol. No one has a pass. Clinton is gone. The video with out of context excerpts is propaganda. Trump is our President. He calls Mexicans drug dealers and rapists, he says Haitians need to be banned because they have AIDS, he wanted to ban Muslims. Those are his words.
@PaulAMarketos @staceydash It’s not admirable for someone to change? I’d rather have a reformed racist around than a practicing one. She was barely alive when he was in the KKK. Don’t play dumb.

@RoderickThreats Based on an unfinalized trade deal? Sorry, there’s not going to be anything in this deal that “pays” for the wall. Any offsets to the costs gained by taxes or tariffs will just be passed on to the American people in the form of higher priced goods.

@SheriffClarke You’re Trump’s lap dog. The word integrity has never been associated with you.
@realDonaldTrump We already have a trade agreement with Mexico.
@GOP By focusing only on Americans murdered by illegal immigrants, which is a minuscule portion of all homicides, you are putting illegal aliens in front of American citizens by diverting the resources needed to solve the 48 murders each day in the US.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/XuDFIFQNfE
@charliekirk11 Or...we should just defund that line item and they can pay them out themselves.
@diffinleslie @RandPaul Sorry, cancer screenings and pelivic exams. Also HIV testing and prenatal services. These are all services funded by Title X.

@Liz_Cheney Same here. We also teach our kids to speak out against social injustice on whatever platform they have at their disposal.

@RoderickThreats @realDonaldTrump Need to get Trump out of office.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I’m pretty sure you’ll end up in prison at some point.
@diffinleslie @RandPaul Can you not read? Removing Title X funding does not make abortion illegal. It simply defunds women’s health clinics and limits their ability to do regular preventative care like mammograms and offering birth control. Abortions will still happen as they are funded by donations.
@RoderickThreats When there are millions of people like that, it’s a cultural issue, not a random or sporadic occurrence. Change the terminology if you like, but it’s something that has to be addressed beyond the confines of the home.
@RoderickThreats I’m not sure it’s “faux” when courts let rapists like Brock Turner off with a slap on the wrist, high-profile actors molest women for years with no consequences, and a man who brags about groping women against their will becomes President.
RT @maxui: Dear #American friends.	I am a White South African living in South Africa.	I promise you the governement is not taking white own…
@RandPaul Well @RandPaul, as you well know, Title X funds, those you are attempting to cut, cannot be used for abortions. Abortions are funded privately or through donations. You are trying to defund one of the largest providers of women’s reproductive health care.
@RoderickThreats Holding men accountable for their actions is not emasculating. It certainly makes more sense than blaming his actions on his country of origin.

@realDonaldTrump You’re already the worst @POTUS in the history of the United States.
@SarahPalinUSA While this is hearsay, we know @realDonaldTrump forces his staff to sign NDAs. This by his own admission.
@realDonaldTrump It’s like everything you write about other people is really about you.
@MissyDemeanour @RoderickThreats @DailyDaily22 @ChelseaClinton @POTUS So you can dismiss scientific data but no one else can? There are mountains of evidence supporting The benefits of the use of vaccines. You ignore this because of your agenda. It’s a moronic and indefensible position. Take care and have a good weekend.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Says the draft-dodging ignoramus.

@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Don’t bother, you’re obviously a moron. Take care.
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany “We”? Great job with the impartial, unbiased news. Even @CNN doesn’t say “we” in reference to Democrats.
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Also, the current US population is estimated to be 325.7 million according the census bureau. If you can’t get that right... https://t.co/BoNvToHrx2

@Twither407 @RoderickThreats No, you’re wrong or lying. Uninsured rates were the lowest in history in 2016.
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats You are wrong, once again. Millions of people who were not insured now have coverage through the Marketplace or Medicaid expansion. Millions.
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Are you a bot? NONE of your stats are true. None of them. Take care, I don’t deal with delusional people.
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Do you really not know that “Obamacare” is an informal name for the Affordable Care Act?
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Don’t call the Act by its name? Were you born in 2008? While the ACA is not the answer, things were not “working” prior to the ACA. You can whine about people getting “freebies” all you want, but law requires they be treated. One way or another, we eat that cost.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/6yZEgx3Qbs
@kayleighmcenany @Ocasio2018 But it’s all #FakeNews, right?
@KellyannePolls @realDonaldTrump Because Trump plays the most important role in preserving our national security. What, we should talk about football, but ignore Goodell?
@RoderickThreats @MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @ChelseaClinton @POTUS No doubt the Feds are liars. Fortunately we have plenty of reputable health organizations that do not work for the government and whose primary goal is protecting the health of our citizens.
@parscale @Paduch “Since Paul Manafort was imprisoned, @parscale has assumed the full-time role of cheerleader-in-chief for @realDonaldTrump” - Me
@RoderickThreats @MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Yes, and fluoride in high doses is poisonous, but billions of people drink it every day in their water with no adverse effects.
@RoderickThreats @MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @ChelseaClinton @POTUS My family is doctors and veterinarians. One of my undergraduate degrees is in biochemistry. While evidence has proven SOME people have adverse reactions to vaccines, the vast majority face life without the threat of many potentially fatal diseases.
These are your @GOP candidates... https://t.co/Jrkv4fXv6x
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Seriously? I tried to ask for information to support your position and you give me a quote about how science is flawed? Goodbye.
@whatsyourtheory @RoderickThreats What blows my mind is how people are just figuring this out now. Growing up on the farm, my mom always said to be careful with the RoundUp, it’ll give you cancer. Hell, it gives plants cancer in a day or two, it can’t be good to get on your skin. #CommonSenseNotSoCommon
@Twither407 @RoderickThreats Bitching about it doesn’t fix the problem. Nobody is doing anything to help. The current plan is to make it worse just to try and repeal the ACA with no feasible replacement.
@realDonaldTrump We were great. We might be great again once you’re out of office. It’s going to take a lot of work to repair the damage you’ve done.
@dvorakoelling He’s 100% reactionary and has no foresight whatsoever. He plays for short-term results to keep his supporters happy. The long-term effects of his policies are going to be devastating. I think the plan this whole time was just to increase his family wealth as much as possible.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Medical results are facts. Manipulating statistics to fit your narrative is not. Why don’t you provide me a link to your data and I’ll have a look at it? I’d be interested to see their methodology and where they draw their data from.
@EricTrump So you hate your dad? Sad.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS I’m well aware of what safety data is (besides a buzz word anti-vac advocates use). As I said before, the facts are that mortality rates for numerous deadly diseases dropped to almost zero post widespread vaccine use. But feel free to not vaccinate YOUR kids and homeschool them.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS The “safety data” is, after the use of vaccines became standardized, millions of people stopped dying from preventable disease. It’s not some conspiracy. I’ve seen these vaccines safe lives firsthand in third world countries. Go see a child dying of smallpox and then come preach.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS You’re going to try to say that there’s more evidence to harmful effects of vaccines than benefits? I may be sarcastic, but at least I’m grounded in reality. Take care.
@DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Polio can present as transverse myelitis. Polio is a disease, transverse myelitis is a symptom. There have been no cases of polio originating in the US since the early 1980s due 100% to...vaccines.
@MissyDemeanour @DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS If vaccines killed anyone, that would be a sad thing. However, vaccines safe exponentially more lives than they harm. That is a fact.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity So he’s admitting the truth about your Administration? I’m surprised he was able to handle the transition back into reality.
@DailyDaily22 @RoderickThreats @ChelseaClinton @POTUS Yeah, wouldn’t it be sweet if polio became a thing again? Or measles? Measles were awesome! Let’s get back to the days when 1 out of 10 babies died from preventable disease.
@GOP So was she not a “dog” when these recordings happened? Or was she lying and tricked a gullible President? Or did the President knowingly hire someone who was untrustworthy? Your options here are not great @realDonaldTrump

@Madmike_v40 @NRA @DiamondandSilk You are obviously undereducated. Stating an opinion about someone’s education and capabilities has nothing to do with race. Donald Trump is misinformed and a side show. The 14th Amendment was adopted in 1868. Many things, including political platforms, have changed drastically.

@RoderickThreats If I remember correctly, Sec 4 of the Voting Rights Act states (paraphrasing): You can’t deny a citizen the right to vote based on a state test or device. Meaning, the act of obtaining an ID could be construed as a barrier to voting rights. That’s one argument that’s been used.
@realDonaldTrump Do you ever actually do your job?
@KatrinaPierson So she tricked @realDonaldTrump into hiring her? Seems like that would make him an idiot. Or...he knew she was a “liar” and “#unhinged” but hired her anyway...making him an idiot.
@parscale Lets see your bank statements then. If not, then you can’t prove it’s #FakeNews. Considering who you cheerlead for, it’s statistically more plausible that you’re lying.
@RoderickThreats Poor choice of words, but Nazis and Antifa both need their asses kicked publicly.
@PressSec So are you going to go back and correct ALL of your lies? I’m not sure we’ll have time...

@RoderickThreats @washingtonpost No worries, just keep in’ it real 👍
@realBeshaneBans @AntonioSabatoJr @RealCandaceO Why “should” they? Encouraging the free exchange of ideas does not mean it’s a free for all, even if this were a government sponsored platform. Numerous SCOTUS decisions have held that restrictions on certain kinds of speech are necessary and constitutional. Try reading a bit.
@GOP So why did he hire her? #OnlyTheBest

@realBeshaneBans @AntonioSabatoJr @RealCandaceO The last words in your comment are “freedom of speech”. If you don’t think those words are first and foremost associated with the First Amendment, I don’t know what to tell you.
@realBeshaneBans @AntonioSabatoJr @RealCandaceO Everyone should quit lying about “freedom of speech”. This is NOT a 1st Amendment issue. To classify it as such is an insult to the Constitution. If you don’t like their business practices, don’t support their company. You have no “right” to their service.
@Nurse4freedom Sure. Still legal. If you’re dumb enough to think your right to free speech is being suppressed by a private company on their free platform, you’ve probably got bigger problems than being kicked of Twitter or Facebook.

@realDonaldTrump So they’re not “good people” anymore?
@staceydash But don’t you Trumpers claim the WaPo is #FakeNews? Not saying Ocasio-Cortez was right, just pointing out your ignorance.

@realDonaldTrump  https://t.co/RfZCMNqLQd
@nobelpatriot @RoderickThreats 1) It’s the Constitution, you don’t just “change it”. 2) It’s been a major legal debate for years, not a recent development. 3) Every President has enjoyed that power, not just the Democrats. Try reading the whole thread and following the logic of a conversation.
@newtgingrich @realDonaldTrump Really? Please elaborate.
@staceydash So it’s #FakeNews to make assumptions about Spicer’s book if it’s the MSM, but your predictions are accurate?
@GOPChairwoman Merrick Garland https://t.co/TJBwX5erwH
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Good to know our POTUS has a promising career with QVC after this debacle wraps up.
@ToddRokita @POTUS The Heritage Foundation? Really? And you really want to put it out there that you expect average take home pay to increase by 20%-40% in most cases over 10 years? Good luck.
@RoderickThreats Who can ignore them out of fear of retribution from a childish POTUS. Unfortunately, we have an imperfect system, but it’s been better than anything else out there (although I’d say we’re moving in the wrong direction these days).
@RoderickThreats Is it right that 150+ million people vote for the POTUS, but have no say in who serves on the SCOTUS? It’s the countermajoritarian dilemma.
@RoderickThreats 10th Amendment.
@JoeStGeorge @cologop Ewww! No https://t.co/6PmRkG8RNR
RT @AP_Politics: AP FACT CHECK: Trump is mischaracterizing newly released FBI documents on the agency's wiretapping of Carter Page, falsely…
@GOP No, they absolutely are not. Unless you mean that they’re allowing the wealthy to buy back their companies. Wages are stagnant and with near full employment, we’re likely going to start seeing inflation. Plus, national debt is going to blow up even further.
@RoderickThreats The city followed the democratic process and their representatives voted on the issue. That’s as democratic as it gets.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Are you going to keep playing dumb? My comment was in regards to President Trump and his disrespect for the constitution. You then asked about President Obama which has no bearing on President Trump’s actions. I’m done with you. Take care.
@RoderickThreats Voting in local elections Falls to municipalities and states. I strongly believe in states rights, so I support their ability to make this decision. I would not support it at the federal level.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO What question did I not answer? I stated that I believe that all presidents have disrespected the constitution. You try to deflect from President Trump to President Obama. President Obama is no longer in power. Please make relevant comments or go away.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Please stop trying to deflect, it’s pathetic. But to be clear, I believe every president has pushed the bounds of their powers with regard to the constitution. In my mind, that constitutes disrespect.
@RoderickThreats Who has outwardly advocated to allow illegal immigrants to vote?
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO I studied constitutional law, how about you? The powers of the president have always been highly debated and are not clearly delineated in the constitution. Executive powers have generally been unquestioned in areas regarded as “national security“. I trust no president completely
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Lol. Cute. You’re mistaken if you think anyone is safe under a POTUS who has no respect for the rule of law or the Constitution. Also, simply attacking ALL liberals is not a debate, it’s propaganda. If you want to attack an idea or certain people, call it/them out directly.
@GaviShapiro @RealCandaceO Ridiculous attempts to vilify entire populations typically result in punitive actions against the minority.
@RoderickThreats So not really much of an issue then. Illegal immigrants try to avoid detection. Trying to vote illegally would probably not help with that.
@RoderickThreats And how many confirmed cases of voter fraud were there in the last election? Of those, how many were illegal immigrants attempting to vote?
@RealCandaceO @GaviShapiro Right. You should make them wear something that distinguishes them from the true #MAGA patriots and make them all live in the same place so they’re easier to track.
@realDonaldTrump You know it’s a bad sign when @realDonaldTrump uses the word “merely” when discussing something he participated in.

@ConspiracyFcast @phxfloaz @realDonaldTrump It’s “schill” and I am home here in Colorado. Leading with the offer of peace does not ring true as a threat.
@ConspiracyFcast @phxfloaz @realDonaldTrump “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars.” - Rouhani. Pretty stupid response by @realDonaldTrump when peace is/was still on the table.
Have you ever noticed that anyone who ends their Tweet with #MAGA is an idiot?
@charliekirk11 Right. Because “the people” control the government. Sure, we elect our representatives, but they act solely in their own interest. Hell, the SCOTUS Justices are appointed, no vote at all.
@realDonaldTrump I keep clicking the handle to make sure this is actually our POTUS’ Twitter account. And I’m disappointed every time to see it is. This person and his followers revel in their ignorance. It’s pathetic and horrific. America has disappeared.
@staceydash Is it hard to be irrelevant?
@AntonioSabatoJr Well, we won’t be voting for you based on your grammar.

@SarahPalinUSA Grow up. Anyone on the SCOTUS is 1000x more intelligent and useful than you.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are an entitled brat.
@parscale Right. Because the best place to start a business means the state has the best economy. Stick to campaigning and leave the economics to people who actually understand it.
@JudgeJeanine @usminority Maybe if you say “actually” a few more time, people will ACTUALLY believe you.
@parscale Really? Because consumers are the ones who lose in this trade war. Pretty much cancels out any gains we received from tax reform. Low unemployment and a trade war is going to lead to major inflation.

@tedcruz @BetoORourke Because we let Israel run amok in an unstable region and support their aggressive actions when the rest of the world doesn’t. I support helping Israel maintain their sovereignty and safety of their citizens, not helping them wage a religious war.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you not understand that they’re doing this because the @GOP knows they’re losing their majorities in November?
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are a moron to even think that is somehow humorous. If you truly think she would make an even passable Justice, you’re brain-dead.
@kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump You realize this is because the @GOP knows it’s losing the midterms, right?
@DonaldJTrumpJr The Republican Party of Ronald Reagan has been dead for a long time. But your father definitely put the nail in the coffin.
@parscale “Trump Campaign Manager”. That title says exactly why you’re not a political analyst.
@realDonaldTrump It’s disgusting when a man who has never done a day’s worth of physical labor in his life and has a history of cheating men and women who worked for him struts around bragging about an anti-union ruling.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I guess it’s hard not to hang out with a prick and a bully when he’s your father.
@kayleighmcenany Who is freaking out? Stop being #FakeNews. Most people are excited about @Ocasio2018 winning in November. We need more young, innovative activists like her in office.
