@joerogan I am a long time fan. Recently, I began listening to your podcasts, and they are always quality guests &amp; content. Looking forward to #UFC fight night Philly on my birthday. 💪
I wish @instagram would separate live and stories posts. Live posts hold up the flow, but I do like to check in with them occasionally. Maybe group them with channels?
@BBCSport I chuckled at this.
@TimeIess_ Too funny
To whom it may concern: please stop using the internet to communicate with me if you can just talk to me in person with eye contact. I have one personality. Push through until I am comfortable with you if you want my personality to emerge.
I like the idea of a biometric combination lock for phone/tablet/computer, so even if someone (or some organization) has your fingerprints they still need to enter them in the right order.

"Things could be worse" is not a valid argument. Things can be better. Stop using past human tragedies like the holocaust, slavery, and various wars to justify and/or excuse modern day lesser human rights violations.

@TopKekTV Also, I did not proofread. I meant conversation not conservation. My mistake.
@TopKekTV I do understand both. I am not saying Twitter is a decentralized, cryptographic network. I am referring to Twitter being a time-stamped network of conversations, where (with proper access) someone can trace conversations over time and make seemingly coincidental connections.

One person can be silenced; millions cannot.
Discuss corruption and unscrupulous behavior you witness in real time via public forum (like Twitter), so others around you can connect patterns of behavior, empathize, and combat these behaviors as a group. More time that passes = more time to modify/erase the truth.

I wish people would just tell me in person what they have heard or assume about me so the truth can finally be revealed.
Everything I post on Twitter is legitimate, even if I deleted it after. If you disagree, then you do not have the correct version of events. The onslaught of misinformation I have dealt with in the last 5 years is enough to break most men.
I don't even know what to say for sex anymore. The rules all changed, and I have been lied to too many times. I only know how to have sex. So skip the semantics and just tell me you want me in person. Most athletic females from teen and up are attractive, for real.

I like when people talk to me in public.
The longer you wait to make me a public figure, the more time you give others to steal all my ideas and modify them to suit their own needs.
Ideally, I travel the country with as many families as possible hosting my stay. We exchange ideas, stories, indoor/outdoor activities, media, business goals, gifts. I make money at events, or performing labor. Offer me a bed for the night, a female as well.
Plus, food is an important part of everyone's life, giving me valuable information about your family. Break bread with me. I will understand better your growth, habits, culture, chemical makeup, moral fitness, movement of resources, language, evolution..
You really need to start talking to me in public and inviting me over your house. The best way for me to analyze society is by breaking down millions of individuals into family systems.

Marriage before sex makes no sense to me. Sex is the marriage. You are blending cultures, resources, time, affecting families, economies, potentially starting a family. When displays of love, affection, and romance cease you are divorced in the mind, altering those entanglements.

@ShafUnlimited What are your thoughts?
@ShafUnlimited Then addiction can become wreckless behavior because you are so far from center, so stressed from manipulation, incapable of entering new relationships and supporting yourself financially that you turn to narcotics as a means to feel some semblance of happiness. Trust is broken.
@ShafUnlimited Then you alter the supply of drugs to change their behavior, ruin their social relationships because noone around them wants to get busted or be a snitch. You slowly mess with their financial means to purchase drugs and pay bills that they normally would afford. Downward spiral..
@ShafUnlimited This is how our society operates, because it is a profitable enterprise to involve so many people and then gain a bonus from a bust. The person is likely too use again, because narcotics do have a medicinal aspect if used correctly, so the profits continue.
@ShafUnlimited Then you speak to their family, friends, coworkers, and neighbors behind their back about their performance, and encourage them to participate in the quest to bring this person down by any means as a lesson. Blame it on the drugs, but leave them alone when they do not use.
@ShafUnlimited I think it is too easy to abuse mass surveillance, using circumstantial evidence to fake abuse; especially when you know when someone is using on a work night and can apply extra pressure on them the next day while 'investigating' for potential crimes.

When are vehicles, especially electric cars, going to start using solar roof panels to maintain battery charge, or supplement interior electronics like the radio? Put a rechargeable lithium ion behind that in-dash on trickle charge and tailgating just became an all nighter.
Pay me if you figure out how to make this work. Hard part is making the electromagnet powerful enough in a small size. Magnets fascinate me; maybe there is a chance. A turbocharger can be utilized with this design to increase efficiency of forced air induction. No detonation.
The idea is that every time the electromagnet fires it repels the piston into the power stroke. This negates the need for a fuel system so valves stay clean, weight is reduced, maintenance is reduced. It is essentially a zero emission electromagnet air pump.
I have an engine concept in my head where you start with an internal combustion engine, then replace the spark plugs with an electromagnet that fires in time with compression stroke. Next, replace pistons with a similar design piston that has a permanent magnet crown.
@basultotommy Is that James Corden and Sarah Silverman? #CarpoolKaraoke takes a detour.
Pay attention to the flow of money. Money is a medium to value every action. Commonly accepted sins have a price, but less acceptable sins earn a higher price. Which is driving the economy more?
Everyone sins. You are being punished for your sins. It is built into our culture, because this is big business. That is why our mainstream promotes irrational behaviors. The question is, who is profiting the most from this? Look around you.
Stop this nonsense of testing everyone repeatedly to determine if they deserve heaven or hell. Life is enough of a test. Manifest heaven on Earth.

We stress the importance of college education, but our nation would be nowhere without welders, technicians, medical assistants, contractors, etc. Education does not stop after high school.
I feel it is important for all Americans to have easily accessible opportunities for free and low cost college/University education. Similarly, those same opportunities are to be extended to technical/skilled labor work as well.
If you see me in public, introduce yourself. I am not shy; I am reserved with people I do not know well. That goes whether I have headphones in or not.

If we wish to improve the treatment of women in our society, we can begin with the way sexual relationships are portrayed in the porn industry. Next, stop insinuating that alcohol is a prerequisite to sex in the majority of tv/movie sex scenes.
Being single is the worst when horny. I normally just give females their space out of respect. Literally any girl that talks to me has advantage over any other girl, because others are waiting for me to say something, I guess? Who knows anymore.
Now that I am settled in from my non-vacation for the past few months, I definitely need some love making asap.

I've had a lot of time in my headspace lately. Carry on.
If computers resemble the human brain, I'd say it is time for a quantum leap. Processing all the intricacies of the infantecimal decimals between 0 and 1. Humans don't have time to wait on shitty, slow politics anymore. The planet is dying. Wake the fuck up. Turn off your ego.
Gravitate towards the center of the spectrum, instead of choosing between polar opposites. Choose between multiple individuals, not only one party or the other. Decide based on human progress as a species, instead of arguing who deserves blame. Too many clowns causing friction.
Binary no longer works for human interaction. Just look at Democrat vs. Republican, cop vs. criminal, capitalism vs. socialism, war vs. peace. Life is never that simple. It is time we start thinking in 3's or 6's; more options than the lesser of two evils.
