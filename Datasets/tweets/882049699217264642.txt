Not sure how you know what videos I’ve watched or listened to. I definitely saw the video where the black Israelites were literally calling one of their black schoolmates the N word repeatedly and they were defending their classmate.
Wow, even with the MSM backing down and admitting they were wrong, we STILL have crazy lefties calling for complete condemnation of these kids. The truth does not matter to them, only the narrative. #CovingtonCatholicSchool #StandwithConvington

He was obviously intent on making some kind of point.
@nowhoppers @MorningBluberry @OldSchoolfan12 @ChasmCzar @iluvmydevin @I_Li_Li_I @kn_iden @kml423 @kamin4 @HoarseWisperer @scryptkitty @jaketapper Why did they have to move if he approached them, never says a word and just bangs on a drum?

Adults can’t act right half the damn time but these kids are being judged for standing there when it got weird. And it did. Did you watch the 2 hour video??
@MorningBluberry @OldSchoolfan12 @ChasmCzar @iluvmydevin @I_Li_Li_I @kn_iden @kml423 @kamin4 @HoarseWisperer @scryptkitty @jaketapper I genuinely see that at first they thought it was it was kind of cool and a different experience. They were going along and having fun. They’re clapping along at times. Then it got weird when the elder wouldn’t back up and get out of their space.
@I_Li_Li_I @MorningBluberry @iluvmydevin @kn_iden @kml423 @kamin4 @HoarseWisperer @scryptkitty @jaketapper It genuinely looked to me like the kids thought it was kind of cool at first and we’re going along with it, then they started to realize that it wasn’t meant to be a friendly encounter. You can tell when they start to look uncomfortable.
@susanbhalpern @howellsuzy @acceleratingJoe @Damania_lolley @smickball @jaketapper The kids were waiting at their designated pick up spot waiting for their buses. Also, that is a public place, they had every right to be there. The adults were the instigators. Try to keep up
