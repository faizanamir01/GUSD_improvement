@AaronWorthing @brianstovall Democrats used to cultivate racists for votes and now Republicans do it. Just ask Lee Atwater.
@AaronWorthing @brianstovall Racism doesn't belong to the small government or big government camp but it does belong to the party that chooses to harness it for votes.
@AaronWorthing @brianstovall Ideologically speaking the Dems today are definitely more the party of FDR than today's GOP is the party of Lincoln.

@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL Obviously some people are ridiculous with what they label racist but that's a minority and not cause to ignore the rest.
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL Listen to PoC when they tell you something you're saying or thinking is racist. Learn from it. Don't retreat and mock the "snowflake" or w/e
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL It sets up a second class of citizens that need to be tamed or watched closely, furthering a cycle of mass incarceration and injustice.
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL So...what's the inevitable outcome of describing a group of people with crime statistics? Does it paint a full picture? Does it help or hurt
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL This thinking strips the ~90% of blacks who vote D of their agency. Maybe listen to PoC instead of dismissing them as exploited sheep.
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL So what does citing crime statistics do to address that? Is the solution to the problem you described more aggressive policing?
@CadeMarshFL @KarlsJohansson @EliseYost Or is it due to deindustrialization? The same force that's leading more white people to drugs and crime now that it's spread to their towns?
@CadeMarshFL @KarlsJohansson @EliseYost It doesn't matter? We all want less crime, so shouldn't we look at root causes? Are black people inherently violent? Genetics? Culture?
@CadeMarshFL Does that change the fact that Google was in a lose-lose situation? It's an HR issue, not a free speech issue.
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL Why do you think that's the case?
@CadeMarshFL @KarlsJohansson @EliseYost You can either learn and engage with people who experience racism or you can retreat to your bubble and pretend you're not aligned w/ Nazis.
@CadeMarshFL If you're a replaceable employee who puts your company in a lose-lose situation on the national stage, expect to be fired.
@DLoesch Lots of people open carrying today. None of them looked like Philando Castile though.
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL It's the answer to that followup that matters.
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL Like, when people say something like "90% of violent crime is committed by blacks." I might counter with "why do you think that's the case?"
@KarlsJohansson @EliseYost @CadeMarshFL White nationalists and Nazis are explicit racists but the majority, and who I'm talking about, are implicit and private racists.

@regwag2003 @scribejones @Spartacussin @neeratanden Sick of watching the Democrats play bad politics for good things while the Republicans play good politics for legitimately evil shit and win
@regwag2003 @scribejones @Spartacussin @neeratanden That's not good politics. Good politics is aspirational. What've you seen lately that makes you believe voters care about facts and figures?
Then why are we stuck with the ACA and why are the solutions from the favorite Dem think tank still trying to manage healthcare w/ markets? https://t.co/7uUPkul7RR
#cardinalburke if you're listening, do an antipope. Come on. Do one.
The reactionaries are too square to do this today but I know they think about it. https://t.co/bZRf6cmlbG
@regwag2003 @Spartacussin @neeratanden They'd still rather cater to Rs who don't exist instead of the Left. White Suburban Rs just want low taxes and no POC in their neighborhood.
@regwag2003 @Spartacussin @neeratanden It's absolute garbage and the only explanation for it is that CAP has learned nothing from the past 8 years.
@regwag2003 @Spartacussin @neeratanden Then explain this:		https://t.co/y4v4O323uc
@Spartacussin You are the worst type of person in the Democratic Party.		I don't want to defend white men but you're straight up intolerant.
@Spartacussin They're not very offensive. Unless you're a part of the pundit class.
@cushbomb Or how the Greyjoys managed to build a fleet and sail it to Slaver's Bay over a couple of scenes. Where are all the trees on Iron Islands?
On one side we have people who believe franchising women was a wrong and on the other are people who were critical of HRC. All misogynists?
I think the Right is right about how liberals calling everything [demographic]ist is suffocating. Shame it isn't reserved for literal Nazis. https://t.co/MAGfHUMMxx
@eonge1 Are you referring to something specific?
@Spartacussin Again, I don't know what you're talking about but I'm pretty sure you'll recover. Sounds traumatic.
@Spartacussin Nobody is telling anybody what to do. Politics is a conversation.
@Spartacussin @neeratanden If the Dems aren't willing to listen to outside ideas that aren't cooked up by the Heritage Foundation, we're all screwed.
@Spartacussin @neeratanden I don't know what you're referring to but their perspective is definitely fresh. People like Neera are trapped in a groupthink nightmare.
"Chapo has no influence. Also, Chapo is why the Democrats have been losing nationwide for 8 years." https://t.co/RqooHAXpY1
@MacEnvy @neeratanden Yeah, blame a podcast that's just over a year old and not the people with entrenched power like CAP and the DNC. Give Chapo a try.
@Spartacussin @neeratanden Literally the only fresh perspective in the game.
@Spartacussin @neeratanden I just started paying and the most recent premium episode was fantastic and worth the $5 alone. They might be immature but they're brilliant
@RyanAFournier Your ideas are sadistic. Come at us with something that will help people for a change.
@neeratanden Underestimate Chapo's popularity and influence at your own peril. Worth listening to them instead of reflexively dismissing them.
