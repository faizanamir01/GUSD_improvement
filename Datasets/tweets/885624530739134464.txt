@Chuck_Nazty @psaundersdp @Rockies @MLB Awesome!!
@Avalanche Love the new lineups. Seems to spread the scoring around and generate more goals!  D is playing great and our goalies look fantastic right now!  Keep it going. Love this team. #GoAvsGo

@Kevin_Lytle @coloradoan Fantastic!  Now we need him to sign.
@1043TheFan @cfbhall Very Cool!  Easy to be a fan of @BigAlRadio!  Congrats to big guy!!
@PredsNHL As an Avs fan it’s the first time I have cheered for Rinne!  He is a fantastic goalie!  So good.
@Avalanche Not injured then?
@Avalanche Why is he not playing?
@Shapalicious Did most if the demo work prior to the auction. My company built the new venue. Had so many fun nights there in college. I have to say when we got work lights on in the basement it was nasty!  The old antiques so dirty throughout. Did get some cool signs for the man cave.

@psaundersdp Would love to see him back. Does he command too much $?  Seems he just really came into his own last year.

@dmac1043 I don’t think enough can be said about the Manning effect to get great players who want to come play here. Elway did get him though so credit there. I think getting FA players an easy sell with Manning, not so much these days. Players came to play with Manning not for Elway.
@RadioMoser Get Daniel Jones.
@CecilLammey @dmac1043 https://t.co/qskinbGM7p
@dmac1043 @CecilLammey Sweet!  I say let’s get this kid!  We have to do something in the draft. Bring in a coach who can develop him.
@CecilLammey @dmac1043 Seems worth a shot. Only QB I watched who would go through progressions on his reads. Who would you have ahead of him?

@Broncos_1and10 @dmac1043 He is a great coach, possibly COTY!  Having Wilson helps a lot also, but he is great.
@hawksrule317 @VicLombardi To have a coach and QB on that level would be awesome!  We are so far off right now. He should be coach of the year if they go 10-6. Lost their starting RB in preseason also. Baldwin been injured all year. Great coach/QB combo.
@LloydLegalist First Gunp, Tin Cup, Kingpin, Old School
@purpledinocast Not homophobic from what I read, just disagrees with the lifestyle. Doesn’t seem like a view point where one would call him a dick?
@LoganH1421 Bailed out is a good take as we got outplayed overall. Good win!
@dmac1043 Still would like to see effort level of the Stars game each time at hone. Better tonight then Monday at home but overall felt like they got out worked. Great win though. Grub is our best goalie.
@Kevin_Lytle Do you think we lack talent on D or just bad coordination?  I was pretty excited to get a new D coordinator last year but results were very poor.
@HelbigKyle11 Welcome to #RamNation
@Kevin_Lytle Any real chance of landing Deon’s son?
@RadioMoser Why do the Avs always come out so flat against bad teams but flying against good teams. No energy like they had last game. Frustrating. They should bury this team early.
@Avalanche Everyone at hone also...amazing.
@Avalanche Why can’t I get the Avs logo behind my #?
@Avalanche Let’s roll!!  #GoAvsGo
@AllbrightNFL I think Broncos fans would have patience with a young QB learning the ropes but to have to deal with a young HC mistakes...so frustrating. At this point I say just ride it out. Otherwise last two seasons for nothing. Unless Harbaugh is available.
@AltitudeTV Get em!  #GoAvsGo

@purpledinocast Love to see him back in purple next y ear. Really commanding. So good.
@purpledinocast Why can’t we resign this guy. He is filthy!!  Makes no sense.
@therealNFLguru Neither look like franchise players. My Broncos suck with Keenum so glad we didn’t overpay for a slight upgrade.
Keenum is barely an upgrade over last year. So hard to watch this team. I also still think VJ needs to go. Start fresh with a new QB OC DC. I would take a year or two of sucking if our QB had promise but not a year or two of sucking to see if our HC has promise.
Look at the faith Sea and Ind have based solely on QB play. D is inspired. Team believes. Tired of Den talking about QB situation. Let’s shoot the moon to get our guy. #AllIn
We need a QB the team believes in more than anything else. Glad we didn’t overpay for Cousins. Keenum inspires no one. At some point D tired of working hard. Von for 3 straight years. Get a young QB the base can get excited about. Dmac was right. @dmac1043

@roxchatter Tacos!  Tacos!!
@YesMrGilbert @Kevin_Lytle Went down to Avos a Saturday ago to watch a good friend in a band. Caught the end of the Arkansas game on the TV and was really fired up. Bar was filled with people from the game before the 4th quarter. Sad when you see the stadium at the end of the game. No one there.
@PurpleRow kind of sad when you are just happy Desi doesn’t hit into a DP.
@Kevin_Lytle We have never really been good other the the Sonny years. That dude was a great coach and we ran him off. Building that big new stadium was a mistake and I know lots of friends that don’t go to games anymore as it used to be fun. Bobo reminds me of Fairchild. Not good.
@psaundersdp @KyleNewmanDP We need to get the bats going!  Playing too tight it seems, just need to have some fun.  Any update on when Story will be back?
@RadioMoser That moment walking up 18 today was historic. Never seen  anything like that. Amazing TV!

@VicLombardi I told my son he needs to have a night. Great first at bat and SB. Have a game kid!!
@psaundersdp Let’s do this!!!
@VicLombardi Why can’t we have a clean 1st inning?  Always playing from behind. Always. Let’s fucking go!!!!!
@psaundersdp @KyleNewmanDP @ken_ That’s fantastic news Patrick!!
@Rockies I’m all in but man could we just have a game where we don’t give up runs in the first inning. Let’s get it back!!
@psaundersdp Such a big moment for Freeland!  Let’s go Rox!  Can’t wait.
@TheFFBallers Traded D Jackson for K Drake. Needed RB. Still have A Brown, M Thomas, T Hill, and W Fuller. Need to move another WR for a good RB.
We seriously have no other option?  He has been a liability and put so much pressure on out other starters to be great. They have been but OMG if we split first two games and roll him out I can’t watch.
@dmac @Rockies @psaundersdp Feels like we need to win with Gray tonight and Freeland tomorrow. I call Wednesday a loss. Two huge games that will define our whole season. My question is if they miss the division title, why continue to roll out Anderson.
@Kevin_Lytle Good to know. I think they should reverse that trend. I get tradition as an alumn but always hated the orange infusion into our usual look. Tradition!  Respect!!
@Kevin_Lytle My least favorite uni combo.  That orange/green...no thanks.  Will they be wearing their CO state flag unis this season?  Love those!
@psaundersdp Indeed!!
@TrevorJudge Our SB50 team wasn't built to win by a lot of points.  D was better then, I think our O is a little better now.
@1RickLewis Good thing we won!  The losing video could have been weird. 😂😂

@psaundersdp I swear if we don’t win the division the thought to keep rolling out Anderson will be the biggest question. To start a road series with him is scary.
@roxchatter Another game we have to score a lot. Anderson...
@psaundersdp @DJLeMahieu Feels like another one where our pen gives up 1-2 and we lose by 1-2. We have had our chances with RISP and can’t quite get it done.
@psaundersdp Still a fan and praying we find a way to that title.
@psaundersdp Not that stat line that carries a team to a title. Plus our hitting with RISP esp with 2 outs has been so bad. We have runners on in all our losses and just can’t push them across the plate.
@DeHuff If it bleeds we can kill it.

@dmac1043 Agreed!  You take it in stride!  I always like your takes and you make me laugh I just didn’t think it was fair to claim Trump went after her without stating why. All good brother!
@dmac1043 I don’t like that he lowers himself in his tweets but at the same time so much hate from the media it’s mind boggling.
@dmac1043 He probably did after he was attacked!  She was suspended for two weeks. Another ESPN reporter recently called him a f’ing idiot on TV. Why would he give them an interview. Hill called him a Nazi.
@dmac1043 Also, to say the protests don’t affect NFL ratings is ridiculous. Last year you hated Kap for taking a knee and this year you said would probably kneel during the anthem with the team. What changed besides the president?  Man has to have morals and stick with them.
@dmac1043 I think you need to look at the comments ESPN anchors have made about our sitting president esp Hill. Very disrespectful. To make it sound as though Trump went after her shows a bias or misunderstanding.

@dmac1043 This article kind of sums up what I was trying to say.  We are not that far away.  https://t.co/EhbiiTyIWO
@dmac1043 Not meaning best in baseball but best well rounded play by play guy.
Joe Buck is a great baseball play by play guy. Very informative without being distractive. Good in FB also. Maybe best in the biz @dmac1043?
@BRKLYN48 @MikeKlis @AdamSchefter @RapSheet I so agree. Feel like we have no QB so play the rookie and chalk the season up to see what we have.
@ZaBlanc @dmac1043 Yeah, my point is get Verlander and how different do we look. I get it’s about pitching...&lt;yawn&gt;
@CoachBobo_CSU @Zack_Golditch60 @JDBennett78 @Moxley6zero @BuysJakob91 @CSUFootball #TearEmAsunder #StatePride  Stay with the program!!  Go state!!!
@dmac1043 Understood. But we can add arms in FA and hopefully our young guys mature some. I guess my point was war are not that far away.
@TroyRenck Paying for it also. Go Stros!!
What's the difference between the Rockies and Astros minus their better pitching staff. Just as good O and better D I say.  @dmac1043
@ScottMillerBbl @psaundersdp He pitched great!  Great for a first game in a WS or any game. Let the BP finish like any team would do. Give him credit.
@Chuck_Nazty @SportsCenter You sir are rock star status!!  Would love to have you out fishing on Horsetooth.  Fall smallie fishing is insane. Let’s go!!

@VicLombardi @CSURams They are so much fun to watch. Should have beat CU if not jobbed by officials.
@VicLombardi @CSURams The whole reason I felt for the new stadium was to get us into a power conference. I think if Bobo sticks around we can do that.
@VicLombardi @CSURams They are fun to watch under coach Bobo. My team for life. Think he stays as he builds the program or exits for a bigger program?

@SoCalAvsFan @dmac1043 LMAO
@chadbrown94 Please NO!  So sick of the QB talk. If we have to hear about it this much means we don’t have one. https://t.co/MnuCKBofLg
@MikeKlis Looked more like left forearm. Either way that’s twice in his career injured chasing down an Int and didn’t even make a tackle.
@CecilLammey @1043TheFan Not that Brock is really an upgrade...ugghhhh
@CecilLammey @1043TheFan Quite possibly the only QB in history to suffer injury twice chasing down an interception and not even make the tackle.
@CecilLammey @1043TheFan Another pick 6. This O is awful. Bring in Brock!

@chadbrown94 We just had a black president for 8 yrs who came from nothing. Raised by a single mom. Is opportunity not out there?
@SixZeroStrength They suck. Only beat CSU because we got jobbed by officials!
@chadbrown94 What are they about?  Still seems vague.
@chadbrown94 What about the disrespect of our flag and anthem?  I guess that’s okay?  So stupid. Oppressed millionaires.

@cjandersonb22 Nothing but love here brother!!
@BKDenverSports @SixZeroStrength Was it an anthem protest...Trump protest...police protest...sad either option.
@dmac1043 So sad a man has to apoligize for standing for the anthem.  This is so wrong.  Free speech only works one way I guess...
@dmac1043 Hate saying we need 2 of 3 against Marlins as it sounds like a loss tonight okay. Want this one so bad. Seems like we need.
@psaundersdp Living...and...dying...watching though as I believe!!!!
@cjandersonb22 You do you!  Your a good man. Never get into an argument with an idiot, they drag you down to their level and win with experience.
@mg4dontplay You the man!  Watching all year!  Love your game brother!  State!!  Let’s get the conference title!!!
@kcsnedah @BMarshh54 America is still about opportunity and opportunity. To deny that fact is ridiculous. One must just have a desire to improve their standing.
@kcsnedah @BMarshh54 What would?  I am all about equality. Just giving you an example of one man who found opportunity. What is stopping folks from greatness?
@SteveBannen “What Happened?”
@kcsnedah @BMarshh54 Or what is this all about besides a disrespect for our flag and inability to accept the results of an election. Grow up.
@kcsnedah @BMarshh54 We just had a black president who came from a single family for 8 years. What rights do minority’s not have?  Do they not have opportunity?
@VicLombardi Right!  Chatwood back to being a reliever. Ugh...
@1RickLewis @Broncos @Cowboys I thought Alfred Williams break down of how to beat them was great. Plus he predicted we would bury them. Smart NFL guy.
@chadbrown94 The presidents response I find really in poor taste but find the disrespect to the flag that has afforded people so much opportunity worse.
@chadbrown94 I am also the son of a marine and served myself. My dad would have kicked my ass if I ever did that. Your right, agree to disagree.
@VicLombardi Stink would have been suspended then...

@dmac1043 @1RickLewis Just don't pan the players keep the camera on the flag!  Simple, done. It's like the cameras sweep the teams now looking for controversy.
@dmac1043 @1RickLewis Solution to national anthem protests would be to focus cameras on the flag during the anthem. Really what it's about.

@CecilLammey I am leaning Hunt and McCaffery if they are both there.  Then like Crowell, Fournette and last Miller.  My thoughts at least.
@CecilLammey 1st pick 12 team ppr. Looking at RB on turn 23,24. Can you rank these backs. Hunt, Miller, Crowell, Fournette, McCaffery?
@1RickLewis It's bad in Ft Collins. Sun looked like a pale orange all day. I bet air quality is really bad. Feel bad for MT.
@JordanSpieth @JustinThomas34 @PresidentsCup Love the future of the game. You, DJ, Jason, and JT so much fun to watch.
