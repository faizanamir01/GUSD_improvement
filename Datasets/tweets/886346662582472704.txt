@Clive__Webb I found you through KevinKruse. Love your timeline! &lt;3
@RepKatiePorter @docrocktex26 This is why I adore you. You're representing the 45th so well already and it's fun to watch.
@PoxNewsCEO 🤔 Mebbe
@PoxNewsCEO Wish they coulda met 🙂
@PoxNewsCEO I love it so much. Thanks for the giggle. 😁
@PoxNewsCEO "Too much month at the end of my money"
@PoxNewsCEO Love the sentiment, but, you sound like my Grammy. 😂
@PoxNewsCEO Thanks. It's mostly an end of the month sort of thing.
@PoxNewsCEO Shocking.
@PoxNewsCEO Basically I'm broke so I'm making do 😂
@PoxNewsCEO Look, I'm willing to enjoy my popcorn and hot chocolate with sad testimony. Don't judge me.
@B52Malmet @VossLily I mean, an asshole serves a purpose. Does he?
@perlmutations Was he *ever* quietly stiffing just a few of us?
@omz_music @RhymesRadical A monkey on a coke binge would at least be able to communicate half coherently. Just sayin 😁
@brianklaas @realDonaldTrump Thank you https://t.co/HsL1FnSIhD
@realDonaldTrump For sweet baby Jesus' and Lincoln's sake: fuck off. You are an unmitigated and disastrous asshat.

@DenThought @AlJean @wkamaubell @TheSimpsons He responded to a nearly 7 month old tweet without actually responding to the *relevant* portion of the content. He comes across as saying "she's on here now so she's wrong and so are you" and it's incredibly childish. I could be wrong though. 🤷
@realDonaldTrump By whom, pray tell?

@BillKristol If the last month is any indication: yes.
@doris_zacco @linecook He deserves respect for his service but that is all. He's a grifter who has dealt in *actual* fake news for a few years now.
@tonyschwartz McTurtle didn't "fiercely" criticize anything. He'll be back in a couple of hours telling us how right drumpf is.
@realDonaldTrump You already owned this shutdown. #trumpshutdown
@TGSRPM @MollyJongFast It would be easier to give him a break if he hadn't had so many years, on record, of being an asshat. I mourn for his losses, and applaud his service, but I'd still like to see him lose his ready access to fleecing people.

@ScottMStedman I'm sorry to hear that you believe/d your vote doesn't/didn't count but I do hope the midterm house flips in CA changed that view. I appreciate that you acknowledged the way propaganda played a role in your non-top-of-ticket vote and hope that you'll forego that in the future. 🙂

@margaretcox2299 @locoribo @Hayabusa_19 @thejollycrank @BravenakBlog Look, Marcia, your patron saint of post offices is a hack. He never marched *with* Dr. King, he's hidden himself in Vermont for 40 years, and his whole platform in 2016 was HRCs platform in 199freaking4. Nobody with half a brain will vote for that jackass, dem or indie.

@joanwalsh @charles_gaba @neeratanden Gosh, this makes me sad about gerrymandering.
@BookSafety So my safety, and everyone else's, rests on using your inserts as shields? That sounds defeatist at best. I prefer sensible gun control (I'm a gun enthusiast so, bite me). Maybe try not to be such heartless dicks when you respond to people. That's why ratios happen.
@sudhaachararts I'm shocked. This is the equivalent of my shocked face: 🙄
@marcorubio You're being roasted because you don't understand what counting is, not because you don't understand sports.
@nowthisnews It isn't an *exact replica* if it has been updated. You're better than this.
@allanbrauer 100% agreed. If he had run while I still lived in his district I'd have voted for him in a heartbeat.
@allanbrauer I like him too, I just don't get to vote for him.
@allanbrauer My parents are probably very happy about that. They've voted for him each time he's run.
@allanbrauer I mean, I was always going to vote for Matsui but you're definitely right. 😁
@NathanLerner It only counts if he finally follows through on his sad/outraged grandstanding.
@chefjoseandres @cryborg @WCKitchen Thank you, Chef. You and your team are wonderful humans.

@CHURCHLADY320 @mikeyoranje88 @JustSomeDude899 @sensen2011 @marcushjohnson All right, I just wasn't sure if the person who posted was trying to conflate Zwerg with BS. Intent is sometimes difficult to tell through this medium. 🙂

@BTSonyeo @PerezHilton Guess I should have chosen another word instead of using ultimately again. Sorry.
@BTSonyeo @PerezHilton I'm a huge fan of hers. 🙂		That's part and parcel to why I accepted your original premise and wanted to have this conversation.		She may hear how well she is adored but how many of us really accept praise at face value? I admit my judgement is skewed. But, ultimately, why judge?
@BTSonyeo @PerezHilton I understand your argument, and it is sensible. I just worry that people are too ready to meme and use stills to make people look...unbecoming. She's a human. Why not treat her like one?
@PerezHilton Celebrities have, ultimately, so little control over their public portrayals that I can't find fault with her request. She isn't asking for people not to photograph her, she is asking for respect. Why is that wrong?

@pinouye50 @AmySings0 @chaddiedabaddie Background checks would be a start for Florida, as that's where this travesty took place, a repeal of "must issue" laws could help as well. Please don't try to misdirect. Illinois isn't Florida and this is an issue we, as a nation, should have addressed long ago.
@pinouye50 @AmySings0 @chaddiedabaddie Again: she placed no blame. She is asking for action. All of us should be mad. This is unacceptable; unconscionable. We should all be asking our representatives to do their part to make things better.
@pinouye50 @AmySings0 @chaddiedabaddie She didn't blame anyone; she said she doesn't want platitudes but preventative action. Those things are entirely different. She's also handled disagreement with remarkable aplomb so, please, don't paint with such a broad brush.
@DebbieLemieux @Dreama1963 @RacingChic1919 @Janice11nj @RealJamesWoods The argument is based on the fact that every trip to a hotel or property owned by Trump increases his wealth. Taxpayers like you and me are footing the bill for his unprecedented number of golf weekends. Despite his assurances that he'd abstain from leisure.
@LibreVerdad1 @realDonaldTrump What can you expect from someone who doesn't know which territories he's president of?
