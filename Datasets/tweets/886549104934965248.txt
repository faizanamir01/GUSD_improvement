But why not make it as difficult as possible for people to get hold of guns? Yes, people can use knives etc but chances are they’ll do a lot less damage. Look at the recent incident in Melbourne and consider how many more people could’ve been killed if the guy had a gun?
Am I the only one that seems to understand that people try to kill each other no matter what if you remove guns they’re going to kill each other with knives and bricks or whatever they can get their hands on, and you can see it in Europe and Australia there’s mass stabbings
Its easier to say we have a "gun problem"...as humans we will blame anyone and anything before we blame ourselves. We don't have a "gun problem"...we have a people problem.
Regardless if you make it easier or harder, if someone with bad intentions has enough motivation they'll get a weapon and hurt as many people as possible. Like I said we have a PEOPLE problem NOT a gun problem.
No I never said that, in certain states and certain instances yes guns are to easy to obtain. Yes gun laws should be a little more strict, I think more mental health checks should be implemented.
In Canada we’ve had 15 mass shootings	Since 1885. 	We have very tough gun regulations. 		In the US	One mass shooting per day. 		Maybe I’m bias b/c I’m Canadian but isn’t it worth sacrificing a few guns to save thousands of children. 		Who will otherwise be killed, each day
