One more mathematical question, how to solve a variant due to multiple factors? I mean how to calculate an object crashed by Newton force and thermal. Time space maybe..for example, t1 Newton force calculation, t2 thermal calculation..repeat  Iterative method... 3/3
Now, the question is what a powerful computer can do if this computer has many core cpu and much more addressing bus?	Galaxy calculation is similar to smart grid. I think weather and airplane traffic are a dynamic system requiring powerful computer for risk simulation. 2/3
At beginning, computer scientist think Power Grid is most complex system, however, such complex system can be solved by cloud server because most of data are static and the math problem(linear equations,Power) can use lookup table.1/3

We can use tiny copper wire to be address bus, but this design requires cooling system. It's too hot. Optic fiber is very tiny and can contain two signal inside(read/write,Red ray/Blue ray). There is no space limitation on mother board if  light will propel along the optic fiber.
Unix Data Center system has a limitation problem. It is about addressing capability. In fact, we can use many CPU to increase computation power, but we need more bus to increase memory address. The number of bus limits multi-core CPU on board. Physical problem(space,thermal).
We can install Unix AI forecast Data Center(priority) in Power Company, MS OS monitoring system in substations(polling), sensor network on equipment(interrupt). It is Smart Grid !!
Unix is passive OS but MS OS is active. Unix will response you only when you give commands. However, MS OS will always polling you what has to do. Unix data center is much cool. Unix will start calculation only when it receives new data input.
Microsoft OS is very good at multi-thread performance so that it is suitable for monitoring industrial system(Smart Grid).  However, it's API is difficult for scientist / academic researcher who actually need to process huge data. UNIX and MS are different applications. https://t.co/0BHBTXfqnV
I think if you want to create a program like "Star Citizen", Oracle shall have Borland C++/OWL(AI class,3D Ray Trace class , Math/Physical simulation class library..etc). The virtual world of Star Citizen needs Oracle database management system when system is complex and bigger.
IBM: "Well class define, Well machine code to multiple core, Well exception handling." I++ is for Military and Spacecraft usage.

Trump: "Taiwan GO Fund" as well, please.	Hsinchu Science Park can initiate photonic manufacturing process, but it may need empty offices for international consultant companies. Please transfer some IT companies to Taoyuan.
Trump: I don't mind "China Green Fund" just similar to "America Great Fund". US officers please recommend a portfolio for China Government's "China Green Fund". Moreover,please bring higher standards of Corporate Governance to Chinese companies. Maybe "2025 China Green".
Trump: Jack told me that China can develop 4.5G which remains 4G frequency but longer emission capability. 4.5G technology looks like repeater for 2G,3G or 4G mobile phone. Please focus on "one belt one road" business development.
Trump: to deal with money which is tied up in stocks, some instructions will make sure return 80% principal at least in the mentioned protocol. For example, increase issues in stocks with average price. Stock options without premium is compensation for the early investor.
Trump: Technical terms are under processing, would everybody mind "America Great Fund"? In my opinion, government will provide a protocol for company's applicant if they meet the protocol which is stricter than government regulation. We provide a portfolio for America Great Fund

Jack: Government shall ask telecom company to charge low fee for voice mail and text service which can protect the basic communication requirement of the human right.
Jack: GSM can not carry out huge messages among cell phones in duplex mode. However, we still can keep GSM system for voice mail and text service with single mode function so that base station can process huge messages with memory buffer but it works like Radio intercom.
Jack: These days, I read about Mobile Phone theory, and was happy that it was worth to having course of communication lessons during master program. I realized why GSM would be replaced by 4G,5G. GSM has large coverage but narrow frequency band.

Trump: It is not a good idea, let spaceman to become free fall. US shall create a critical basic rules to design,test, operation,evaluation of new type of traffic. We shall pass this bill.
Because Taiwan is "under" developed country.....But I'll learn one thing, never take any new design traffic.
Maybe, Dr. Lo (my teacher,ever) will help to setup a series rules to receive a new train. How to judge people if we don't have a standard? Even we know IEEE and IEC have good examples for their reference. But I am not surprised, Germany happened once, US spaceship happened once.

Oh, maybe, they did make many money........................on it??
One more thing, if the train speed is up, risk is up,too. Will they evaluate earning model? If risk is up, management system is more expensive, Is't it? Did they calculate financial problem. We learn from book? 2/2
As a conclusion, they shall treat such new type train as a NASA spaceship for their management system. It is very very very different from a regular train management system (old type but accumulate many skills and instructions).1/2

You can refer to test rules of power company standard. Car crashed test is needed in Car industrial. About management system, can ask Japanese company. Many industrial experiences can provide to the new design equipment. As much data you get as much security you have. 4/4
In power company, any new power equipment shall be done a type test. It is a standard rule for power company. Furthermore, a train is a moving part carrying many people, it is more critical than power company standards(not allowed to change part design if type test is done). 3/4
The train company shall use much more ways as possible as they can to prevent the accident and learn the math model for it's reliability. Cost down, later on. Unfortunately, they cost down first without any reliability reports or approval from Japanese company. 2/4
David: This train accident was 80% caused by human(management system) according to my view. It is a new type train that we did not have enough information to design a cost down management system.1/4 https://t.co/lpQEIGnE9k

Therefore, Michael puts lot of money into this place, God learn many skills to hurt good people, because bad guys want money. After 70 years, Michael thinks time is up, he needs to get money back and make a list to God. 2/4
One day, God feel evil on the earth. God want to clear a little space for good people. God ask Gabriel(CIA) to visit this place and get a list of bad guys. However, Michael(FBI) don't think so. He has a fast way to get bad guys. 1/4

After my explanation, you can understand why Japan has this boring show. It very like somebody's nightmare and it may provide some message from ghost. I got two nightmares similar to this terrible nostalgic vibe.
竹生島(宝生流) https://t.co/RI0iPOuU4O 來自 @YouTube
You can find it's story on internet !!
It really scare me that my nephew (1-2 years old), she showed me a card with a cute ghost mark after couple days. It is the same in my nightmare. When I saw the picture on the internet.... It scared me a lot.....looks like my nephew... https://t.co/2WhmB1PrIe
In contrast, I can feel the evil of this angel's enemy. sometimes, I don't understand what my family talked about, maybe the ghost want to say something to me via my family(Jewish people). That is why people believe Religion. Maybe I have Jewish's bloodline. 2/
According my experience, we may lose your soul in some way, and get it back when a baby birth. Maybe the dream show you where it goes and lives with somebody for a time. Well, I have ever felt a angel as a girl child murmur after my pray for my father. 1/
In my nightmare, I was sitting in the bus originally, suddenly, I was standing in front of the bus, the bus almost crashed me. The first word "男" appeared to stop th bus, then "Boy", "保怡","報應", I got buffer time and said "HalleluYah" three times. I waked up and feared. 4/
When I was junior high school(16), my relatives drove me to see the movie. On the way back home after the movie, A car hit our motorcycle, I fell down on the ground and broke my hand. It is close to my nightmare in 5 years ago(36). 3/
I slept at night and I felt wake up but I can not move my body. I was sleeping under a hanging fan in the living room. I just though that I was pushed by the ghost. I can see the fan on the roof, but I saw a big red spider,too. Did I loose my part of soul and came back again? 2/
When I am a primary student(11~12) , I jumped from a high wall and falling down to the ground. I lost my conscious around 1 second. I think that I shall get hurt but I didn't. It is very close to the dream happened to me in 20 years old.  1/

Bingo, holy spirit is no limitation about time and space. I got spirit response earlier than baby was born. We can not kill evil, but just get them away. May be put them in a container. Mum Mum My Ya.....: P . That actually is what religion do.
I got special experience when my father was sick heavily. I was so sad about my family, a weak feeling touched me and comforted me. In a argument, I hear something, anyway, it connects us together. In other words, evil can detect us in spirit way, they attack so strongly.
Several years ago, I saw this dragon mark on an old man face(Mr. Lee). They are family? Or this dragon will find a new master when a old masters life will be terminated? Your behavior will show up a spirit image and impact someone?
In Chinese, we believe reading can help "face upgrade". Well, don't plan evil things, people can detect it from your face. Be honest, people can find your lies from your eyes. Be Good or Be Bad may gather Ghost or Holy Spirit on you? She got an dragon mark on her face.

Pence draws somebody's attention whatever their age. especially a 8 years old child. I got Pence more than that. Obama is under law due to a penny but I never complained their crime for not telling me what it is in advance. I even do't know who is God, that time.

Basically, C++ design is very like math language. Class is like a set theory. Operator as x,/,+,-."System Class" will provide tools to build a mathematical model. At least, we need a "Fuzzy System Class". C++ with System Class will provide tools for scientists and mathematicians.
It is hard to find a student like this. "Mathematical body and nature". In this paper, we will introduce current mathematical works and finally indicate the future Mathematical development. Mostly, it is about measuring tools. How Mathematicians cooperate with Scientists.
Set Theory,  points out factors of a event.  Signal, provides a math to simulate real world signal like fourier series. Fuzzy system is very important to combine all of system in universe. It provides a "cheap" way to calculate the interact of system in universe. https://t.co/ubXG2s0U83
Peter V. O'Neil, The Math Model can be divided into 1)Set Theory, 2) Signal, 3) System(linear, fuzzy ...so on).There are many system math models of universe which we still don't know. But personally, I like to introduce math with a brief overall picture of math to readers first.

If we can improve poverty of the world, The GOD economic model shall be developed. It is a future economic model from Earth to Moon &amp; Mars. Detect what rock materials on Moon &amp; Mars to be energy resources.
Therefore , we can improve some poor towns from 1.5 to become 4. For developed countries from life quality 9 to 7, this reduction can be called "Climate Change Improvement". (2
We learn that we can not use modern economic theory to improve the third world countries. It is simple to evaluate the area economy with the life quality. A developed country with Life Quality 9(1-10) can reduce it's index (GDP) to become 7. (1

Church member is close to priest's function(Abel). Believer looks like Christian fighter(Cain). It is very difficult to make alive in our society if you act according to Bible standard. Unless, you are very smart and humble. We hope our church members are smart and humble.
Two kind of believers : Poor people looking for immigration, Smart people study knowledge of Bible. So, we may have a president believes in God but he is not Christian. Is that OK.
Church member : Provide service to Church. (High personality requirement,register) Believer : agree with Christian belief and Bible.(No crime, no register)

Trump: Of course, hard workers want this company but they do not know math to share benefit. Why not build church to teach math? Smart workers insist on having mayor's children studying math in the church for their benefit. Due to a good mayor, this town becomes a great city.(3)
Trump: Most people like this idea because each family need women to pump water everyday and it is a long trip to the river. This town will have more manpower to produce goods.This water storage company issue a question. How to share the benefit? It is a complex math (2)
Trump: Yale students asked me why not fund a stock company? Yes, probably...Because citizens have many soy so that they can live for months without working. A young man proposed to build a water storage. They can hire workers and horse for pumping water.(1)
Trump: Not every mayor is good. So Chinese has "靈" this word. 品(瓶) 巫(屋) This word reminds how to be a good mayor. https://t.co/9ovoN7qjSC
Trump: Very long time ago, Mayor use ropes and ties to show price, Originally, he used actual things but raining day....so Chinese use the word "需". https://t.co/YbtvJRcPLi
Trump: One smart guy provides mobile service for Bitcoin in African small town........Why should I tell so many details........(9)
Trump: Mayor's warehouse looks like WTO. Blacksmith's horseshoe is Blockchain. Business in a small town of Africa looks like Blockchain due to poor traffic and poor education. People trade goods in soy.(8)
Trump: How many soy is needed for a blacksmith's service? Are you sure blacksmith just has one horseshoe for you? If he does not, he shall make 10 pieces at the same time and keep 9 pieces for the next customer,right? There is only one blacksmith in town. Exclusive business?(7)
Trump: The father knows when to buy cheap food according to the weather. It is Futures. In this town, nobody uses coin, they use soy to exchange goods. There are trade formulas in Mayor's warehouse but others are not. The bargain of other goods are more complex. Why? (6)
Trump: In Chinese, "供需" means public demand. "需" looks like a price board. The warehouse provides public demand(food) to people. Those products can use  formulas for fair trade. A father find the math of trade, he asked his son to remember the price board everyday.(5)
Trump: According to Mayor's experience, he writes down formulas:	3x+2y+z=C1, 2x+3y+2z=C2, 4x+y+z=C3  	if sausage=x,cookie=y,dried fish=z, so citizens only can buy under those conditions. However, Mayor modifies the formula sometimes due to weather.(4)
Trump: Pork,Fish, Flour are rot easily. Mayor will make sausage,cookie,dried fish and store them in the warehouse. Citizen can use soy to exchange them. Question is that the Mayor hope citizens exchange 3 kinds of things at the same time. So the mayor have a table for trade.
Trump: The Mayor have two calendars, one is raining day, one is sunny day. It shows schedule of farming and manufacturing food. Demand in Chinese is 需(雨而). Mayor will pay soy to each workers but keep soy in the warehouse. The workers just take how much they needs.(2)
Trump: so sad, Stanford students asked me what is blockchain? Fine, I am a business man and I can explain it in a simple way. In west cowboy movies, Mayor will build a warehouse in the small town. This warehouse will store sausage,cookie,dried fish.(1)

Trump: Department of Economy and Energy, electricity is the bone of country economy. Negotiate technology transfer to win Tariff. Promise to put money into green medium industrial. Green products (6%)with green transport(2%) shall be lower import tariffs(6%+2% or 6% ,deduction).

It is a long story and deep theory about my explanation, I think people will discuss "Unquantified Economic Theory" including military force, political effect, natural power since well known economic theory lost it's attraction and does not dominate economic market anymore.
Accordingly, it is a great chance for China easing the impact of economic transition. We learned from the past, every country will encounter economic problem like what happened to America. Why not join it and make a big step progress? If US solves it alone, US will get arrogant.

I hope Trump understands how to make a little mouse become an elephant, good is not enough for him, He wants to make America Great. Once, he loses the best timing than ever before, great will never happen.	Any project manager will agree with my suggestion about timing.
When our candidates cannot propose right country vision, even, they can not fulfill their promise, that is not democracy. We shall follow American mainstream, finally it will benefit us like IT industrial in the past.(US gives up IT hardware, transfer it to Taiwan/OEM)
In fact, there are many complex considerations involved the strategy decision. Personally, I agree that Obama and Trump are the right candidates for those missions. So, America design country vision first, then pick the right president. That is why democracy.

公主中看不中用，困難職務一來，能閃則閃，不能閃就用眼淚攻勢，央求主管或拜託臨座同事。然而等你費了功夫幫忙了她，下次輪到你有難，希望她伸出援手，她卻閃得比誰都快。這類人自尊心脆弱，稍有成就便吹噓，見別人成功就雞蛋裡挑骨頭，在背後批評得一文不值。
公主病用心理學術語來說，這類人通常綜合了自戀、邊緣、戲劇、與倚賴等個性特質，這種人非常難剃頭，你若跟她坐在同一個辦公室，通常是你前世做惡多端。
怎樣特質的人喜歡當公主？同理心比較薄弱，不會為別人著想；需求延緩困難，肚子一餓就哭到剉青屎；衝動控制不佳，一氣起來就哭喊踢打；喜歡得到注目，人家一稱讚鼓掌就開心到飛上天。
例如時常不經思考就衝動購物、時常發生一夜情等；此外，也可能患有「間歇性暴怒症」，平時看來正常，但觸碰到他的「怒點」，脾氣就會一觸即發，一般人不會生氣的事，他卻反應很大，例如店員找錯錢就痛毆他一頓等。
衛福部雙和醫院精神科主治醫師林佳霈指出，性格易怒可能患有「衝動控制異常」，正常人的大腦反應流程為接收訊息→處理訊息→思考→輸出反應，但衝動控制異常的患者在處理訊息時，直接跳過「思考」階段。也就是說，他常常以「直覺」作反應，
衛福部雙和醫院精神科主治醫師李耀東指出，一般常見的精神疾病，幾乎都有「易怒」、「暴怒」的特質，但原因與表現方式都不太相同，包含躁鬱症、憂鬱症、反社會人格等。患者除了「容易暴怒」，通常還伴有其他合併症狀。
我的直覺這不只是恐怖情人的問題, 而是對方背後有黑社會或某勢力介入單純的兩人感情, 藉由感情控制對方行動思想以達到配合某政治或利害團體意圖, 希政府提供申訴管道, 及早調解雙方結束關係, 避免歹徒得逞...
只怪我從小就生長在家暴家庭, 習以為常, 我小時候看到我媽拿菜刀恐嚇我爸, 還是我跑出來制止...希望學校要好好教導情緒管理..........😂😂😂
太...太...太...太可怕了!!😂😂😂
https://t.co/zi8g9pkHsl
當然對方會抗拒會拒絕，而你則需要說：「如果你不覺得有問題，我還是無法待在讓我害怕又受傷的關係裡，如果你不接受幫助，那我會選擇離開不再跟你生活！等到你情緒好轉了我們在說。
千萬不要用自己的力量去承接和安撫對方的情緒，施暴的伴侶通常都需要專業的幫助，他們在情緒控管已經出現障礙，因此最適合的設限語言則是：「我很在乎你，但我不能接受你這樣對待我，也無法過總是害怕你會爆炸的生活，讓我們一起去尋求協助好嗎？我害怕繼續在這樣我會走不下去。」
