@plambeckery @DrJenGunter @andizeisler You’re ok now? That’s what counts. On a positive note, the hospital that creeped my out the most was torn down and turned into a really cool student union building. Sen. Warren was the first speaker after it opened and I got her signature. ULowell has come a long way:-).
@plambeckery @DrJenGunter @andizeisler I vowed to never use such a hospital, read the fine print and never let someone control my body that way. My body, my baby, my family, my choice, shame on anyone who thinks they know more about what you go through. I hope all is well now. The NICU is one hard test for parents.
@plambeckery @DrJenGunter @andizeisler Thank you, so true. Such decisions are so personal and so private. One of the most shocking things I learned as an Undergrad student was about how a Catholic hospital could with policy, make that choice. To save the baby over the Mother if she was under anesthesia. Scared me.

@chocolatetarte @nowin2613 Oh yeah, shame on me for having less than a 1/4 of a tank of diesel today. I didn’t dare drive until the needle on the temp gauge moved. Steady as she goes. Squalls tonight too, those are pretty. Did you have ice? I hate the damage ice does. Cheers!
@davidmweissman You shouldn’t have too. I also support ranked choice voting.
@punkscience8 @Nataya @SlenderSherbet @nowin2613 @DOfaquarius @SageHillfarms @rini6 Fun. I was just complimenting my parents new lifestyle tonight. They have been avid curlers for years now.

@phylogenomics @CNN I take my account name seriously.

@chocolatetarte @nowin2613 Yes, this.
@nowin2613 Something warm, it’s cold here lol! I had to run my diesel for a good 10 minutes before I dared to drive away today. One of those nights that the local school buses may just run all night. BTW Happy belated, I hope it was a wonderful time yesterday.
