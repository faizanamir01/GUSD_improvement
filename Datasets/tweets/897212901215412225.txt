@_____Adrian_ @freespokenvoice @NancyPelosi 3.7mil. Households that they know about receives 54.4 billion in subsidies. The actual total is 11.1mi. Illegal immigrants in this country
@_____Adrian_ @freespokenvoice @NancyPelosi I'll go research it and come back and check pen with you
@NancyPelosi I know it's off subject but it is truly mean and ungrateful what these non-citizens did to you. They can't see how much are helping them.
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Well basically Tucker, people are just starting to realize that they're not smart it was a script
@SteveBannen That sounds more enjoyable than what the Emmys would have been anyway
@SenSanders Right and it's nothing like your plan is going to throw 320 million people in the poverty
Paying federal taxes is what u.s. citizens do. This is why we expect our representatives to represent us. Paying local taxes don't count
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I say we should start our border wall in Oregon
@repmarkpocan Ok, but why?
@terrymendozer @lovingmykids65 The definition of the word boob is a foolish or stupid person
@LJRusso @DougLaMalfa @FoxNews @ffweekend @JenKernsUSA @HillaryClinton they did she refused entry
@RepAdamSchiff You do understand that it's called the executive branch for a reason right? He is doing his job. You're in legislation right? Do yours....
RT @PatrickMcHenry: On this day 230 years ago our founding fathers signed the document that laid the foundations for this great nation. Hap…
@SteveBannen I think we should start the construction Texas. The West Coast plans might be revised to stop in Oregon
One out of three Americans in Philadelphia Pennsylvania can't name one of the three branches of government. Very very very sad
@ACLU_SoCal @RepJimmyGomez @sdACLU @ACLU_NorCal Thank you, this is what is truly needed, it's someone to help interpret the standing laws so these fine upstanding ppls can become citizens
@realDonaldTrump @GenJohnKelly Very sad,
Just got blocked by someone trying to debate something they know nothing about. Score! My work for today is done.
@RepJimCosta I would love to participate. Can you please list a few of the contributions? I'm eager to learn
@realDonaldTrump Thank you mr. President for all you do.
@RepAdamSchiff So true. No form of Supremacy, hate groups, for violent protesting should be tolerated. It's the true to Heart Americans that suffers
@repmarkpocan @realDonaldTrump This is so very true. Since we look on the Senate as our leaders, they should lead by example in all get behind our commander in chief
@jasondaye Right he feels that way about Trump too
@newtgingrich You know Trump. The GOP let him down so he's going to get the other side to help. &amp; if that don't work, the deplorable party will arise.
@DessypeerT Because Gene Simmons is awesome
@MotherJones @JoaquinCastrotx We shouldn't have private prisons
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Apparently not if you follow the Democratic Party.
@AllenWest Isn't this a black supremacist group? I guess research is required B4 we name them a hate group. Sounds like one of those white guilt things
@TuckerCarlson @replouiegohmert @FoxNews Yep, I say we started in Oregon
@TuckerCarlson @AlanDersh @FoxNews Do what Reagan did. Send in the Guard &amp; when the parents come to get the kids from jail or the morgue. Prosecute them for child endangerment
@i0xooo @lovingmykids65 Although some of the issues that must be addressed by legislation Representatives is inhumane, a level of diplomatic protocol is required
@lovingmykids65 Yep the serpent is showing its head.
@GenJohnKelly This is correct. All of them start their statements of propaganda with the ppl have requested. My question is what ppl &amp; are they citizens?
@mitchellvii Well it's like all forms of artistic creation, you either have it or you don't. If you don't you're in wrong lot of work
@BetsyDeVosED @MandelaElem But it was the low road to the approach. Instead of enhancing the educational practices for Underachievers, they subdued the lateral
@realDonaldTrump @GenJohnKelly Thank you mr. President for all you do have a wonderful day at the office
@GenJohnKelly I don't believe President Trump is a Rep. or a Dem. He is an American and that is why he won. A actual bipartisan agenda is what we voted 4
@LeroyGillam1 If the DREAM Act only covered DACA recipients and the parents of children born in the US. But it includes 10.3 m. Identity theft suspects
@RosLehtinen @POTUS We already have the laws needed.  What we need is a program to help assist them in the process. Social worker jobs. Two birds one stone.
@realDonaldTrump @GenJohnKelly The wall needs to be an actual wall. The money we'll save in health care, housing, and our education system alone will pay for it
@GenJohnKelly Nothing against DACA, seems like they actually want 2 be citizens. Build a wall &amp; get rid of the other 10.3 million identity theft criminals
@KamVTV @lovingmykids65 @cnnbrk @NBCNews @LVNancy @advocatingasd @redthunder31 @TrumpGirlStrong Here it's comes, and they come out of the wood work sooner or later.
@AD_WHITMAN @lovingmykids65 Right, we have been concerned about not being offensive for so long that now this can happen and you can bet it happens often. Terrible
@RepDanKildee @HouseDemocrats I have not personally met one American or illegal immigrant that has this opinion in my area. Polling data as trustworthy as the pollster..
@RepSusanDavis Aquire funding to hire social workers to help them through the existing process. That's how, and you will also crate a few hundred jobs
@WiredSources This sounds like LGBT is promoting Heterosexual Supremacy
@WiredSources So they're going to deny Commerce and hold his livelihood at gunpoint. Who would do such a thing. I know, LGBT now is hate group.
Apparently having a moral compass is not one of the required qualifications to become a member of Congress.
@DPPodcasts @RepTedLieu @bpshow @NiallStanage Would love to, but not really a fan of talking to close minded people whose only knowledge of the issues come from media-driven propaganda
@RepTedLieu @HouseGOP The program has reached its cut off date. Our commander in chief actually gave it an extension. It's a matter 4 the legislative branch.
@nytimes WoW! Really? He did just that on his first denouncement on Saturday about the charlotteville incident. I would like to see this resolution
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats Okay real talk. Here's the deal, I'm an American, what doesn't kill me makes me stronger, All are created equal, united we stand
@RepJaredPolis @realDonaldTrump Trump addressed it because the Obama PO had an expiration date on it. In fact, it was congress's job to take care of this in the 1st place
@RepRobinKelly @MadisonSiriusXM @HouseGOP One more, and I'm sure you remember this. Give someone a fish and they eat today, teach him how to fish and I'll never go hungry.
@RepRobinKelly @MadisonSiriusXM @HouseGOP I said I believe you were above This type of rhetoric agitation. Don't let them make you a party mule, be the Good Shepherd that you are.
@RepRobinKelly @MadisonSiriusXM @HouseGOP In fact the benefit amount is substantially gracious. Which is also one of the contributing factors on why people try to stay on them
@RepRobinKelly @MadisonSiriusXM @HouseGOP Madam Congresswoman, I believe you are above this. As a parent and a former recipient of the program, the benefit amount is acceptable as is
@RepRobinKelly @MadisonSiriusXM @HouseGOP WOW, REALLY? Madame Congresswoman, are you making an accusation that members of Congress are literally taking food from children? Bad form.
@rejecttrump123 @NBCPolitics We need the wall. We're gaining in population faster than what we can subsidize for it. We won't be able to help anyone if we are diluted
@RepMikeQuigley @HouseGOP Polling data can never be trusted, just ask Hillary.
@repjoecrowley What are the easiest ways is too enforce some of the laws we already have. The removal of 11.3 illegal immigrants might open a position or 2
@worldnetdaily One of the biggest reasons why Hillary lost was she doesn't mention is the internet. People were actually able to research the candidates
@RepJeffDuncan I would say it's long overdue.
@CB618444 @lovingmykids65 Yep or wasting too much money just keeping them in prison. The penalty for treason is death and bullets only cost like $0.87 a piece
@JVER1 @RIndivisualist @Chairmnoomowmow @espn @jemelehill What they fail to realize is that they have awakened the silent majority of which  contains only true Americans. The Free Ride stops here
@RepStevenSmith @lovingmykids65 All true, they're also the reason why the silent majority became silent. It was nothing but a big shameful embarrassment
@SteveBannen @HillaryClinton Yep I'd say that about covers it.
@WiredSources These expenditures are only the tip of the iceberg. It will also diminish treatment research and prompt mandatory physicals and vaccinations
@RexTilllerson I thought they were classified as a domestic terrorist group. So if that's the case, it be like fishing a stock pond 4 the FBI. openseason
@davidcicilline Yeah, it's sad but at least all of us will be there together. Here's 1, you can't defeat bad with bad. Only good can defeat bad.
@TeamPelosi @RepTedLieu Some of the biggest problem with hard line issues threatening our communities is the lack of clear tangible information &amp; filing assistance
@TeamPelosi @RepTedLieu Most DACA recipients that registered in 2012 already possess the qualifications required for citizenship. Some paths required no sponsorship
@TeamPelosi @RepTedLieu we need Outreach programs actually help these people establishes citizenship. There are many ways for this to happen already. New staff req.
@allinwithchris @brianschatz It is a falsehood to statr we never had a Strom like this, because we have not been able to record data as we do today sense time began
@RepMikeQuigley What a irresponsible thing to say. Appointments in this field should not be based on religious beliefs, race, gender, or party affiliation.
@CNNPolitics Not an easy position 2 be vetted 4. Most attorneys make way more money in the private District. &amp; I know that several of them turned it down
@g_ribreau @reppittenger @POTUS @The_Robesonian The wall is for the other 10.3 million illegal immigrants so we have in this country so that number doesn't grow as fast
@g_ribreau @reppittenger @POTUS @The_Robesonian No the wall doesn't deal with dreamer and it wasn't supposed to. The 800,000 DACA recipients or at least somewhat document.
@reppittenger @POTUS @The_Robesonian I definitely concur.
@RepCummings Okay voter fraud is not a myth. Both sides the aisle has been guilty of this one way or another but I agree it needs to be simpler..
@RexTilllerson Right, I thought that was understood. Apparently mr. Johnson has never worked in sales
@mitchellvii @lovingmykids65 Most definitely
Sometimes doing the smart thing to appeal to the masses completely remove the ability for future generations to gain wisdom from it
@DonaldJTrumpJr @JudgeJeanine There are words to describe this. Sad is the only plate when I can think of to
Would like to thank Congress for the absence of partisan rhetoric at this time of both past and present catastrophic events. Honorable
@RexTilllerson Timing off a little? Todays objective is honor the Fallen, support rescue efforts, and promote Unity. We can always laugh at Mitt tomorrow
@SteveBannen Timing off a little? Todays objective is honor the Fallen, support rescue efforts, and promote Unity. We can always bash bill tomorrow
@SteveBannen At least there's a possibility it could be useful there, now if we can just get the Publisher to print it on parchment inbeded with lotion
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED I believe that's exactly what she's doing. This issue should not be blanketed under an outdated Equal Rights Act..
@BreitbartNews @lovingmykids65 WOW! She's just upset because they found about OneUnited. &amp; she is also on record promoting violent protests. This person is evil.
@dougducey Thank you governor for all that you do. I wish all governors would take this type of action in their own States. Keep up the good fight
@GenJohnKelly @Kaepernick7 Matter fact, if you receive any type of government Aid, you should display your patriotism and gratification by flying a flag at home.
@GenJohnKelly @Kaepernick7 I concur, I bet if flag burning was a disqualifier for receiving government Aid(and so it should be), there would never be another one
Counting DACA, there are over 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country. Over 89% of them are Latin American.
Congress is trying to bundle immigration laws. They tell U about the success of DACA and hide the criminal actions of the other 10.2 million
@repdinatitus @HouseDemocrats @GOP Well I would like 2 help Victor out &amp; those that have done well. But what about the 10,200,000 other illegal immigrants this bill will cover
All this talk about the 800,000 dreamers, no talk about the other 10.2 million illegal immigrants that would rather stay criminals.
@SenatorMenendez Once-in-a-generation is a very short time compared to the life of the planet. Category 5 hurricanes are not new. Work on Healthcare
And we also need to build the wall to someone help keep us and all of our new citizens safe.
We do need to work on a legal path for good, eager, caring PPL to be US citizens and embrace the American way.
And although there's only 934,872 DACA recipients. The other 10.3 million illegal immigrants are still draining our country.
You have to be 18 years of age to apply for DACA. So no DACA recipients are children.
If you are an illegal immigrant working in the United States, you are probably guilty of identity theft &amp; tax evasion.
@RepJoeKennedy @HouseDemocrats You are the exact definition of a snake in the garden. Stop disgracing yourself by attacking our commander in chief and do your job. Fix it.
@GenDaveGoldfein @TeamCharleston @AirMobilityCmd @NoradNorthcom @southcomwatch Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Thank you sir for your service to our country and fellow Americans. Godspeed
@PoliticalShort Going through you is quite easy. When was the last time you carry the 250 lb steel beam up 3 flights of stairs? Right, get back in your hole
@SenatorDurbin I know right? What a hopeless scenario for your inevitable faith to be in the hands of Congress. My heart goes out to them I know their pain
@NicholeHale29 Sticks and stones, I get it too, but we have to call it as we see it. Keep doing what you do, the world will always need truth.
@SenSchumer No, this will only happen if Congress allows it to. Address the immigration problems in the legislative where it belongs. Go to work
@SpeakerRyan Fund the wall project. This will slow down the projected growth of several of our social programs. Healthcare, housing, gov assistance,exe..
@SenSchumer Yes I can feel their pain, now that Congress is responsible for their future. They too will now lose all hope due 2 legislative shortcomings
@SenThomTillis We have one. I think all of y'all should review the laws that are already in place. Before you speak out on the subject to the public.
@SteveBannen Not sure she's even from this planet. Don't you find she has a weird type alien aura about her?
@GenJohnKelly The American people expected A fair and just response. Now it's up to Congress to fix it. I would make a joke but that's funny all by itself
@SteveBannen Yep isn't it great, president Trump got the populace to put Congress on trial
@SenSchumer Great, wouldn't this money stimulate the economy and their area? Not to mention the burden it would relieve from housing and food stamp prog
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump Thank you! As Americans we want to help those in need, but if I Foundation crumbles, we will have no support system and can't help anyone
@mitchellvii Yep, people forget that Trump wasn't going to back the GOP nominee if it wasn't him. So just because he's not Democrat, he's Republican?
@GenJohnKelly Thank you sir for all that you do. It's the honorable people that serve makes me proud to be an American
@SenBlumenthal Really you see all of them even the ones that lurk in the shadows behind the cover of a few of them that are actually want to be American
@SteveBannen Right, believe me there's little that I will forget, and more than happy to remind them
@davidcicilline I think it should be mandatory to become a citizen if you want to stay in this country. And if you can't follow the rules. You should leave
@GenJohnKelly Damn it, I have a group of sugarcane Farmers that we're looking to purchase those books for fertilizer
@SenFeinstein Sure did you mention anything about the 120,000+ of them involved in criminal activity. Or the 2332+ involved in Gang Related crimes?
@MarkWarner Wake up. He condemned all hate groups. That includes those that you listed and also antifa, BLM, and radical violent religious orders. .
@PattyMurray Yeah he's kind of forcing y'all to actually go to work. What a terrible person.
@SenFeinstein Yeah so was Healthcare &amp; tax reform. Matter of fact, by removing DACA it will take a lot of the strain off of healthcare. Just might work.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS Sorry but you represent Americans. Not illegal immigrants. You're not vetting these people like you're supposed to. Just a false paper trail
@HeyTammyBruce @lovingmykids65 Yeah he pretty much changes position as he goes. Bipolar political agenda.
@USNJack @lovingmykids65 @realDonaldTrump That is just sad.
@seanhannity No I'm afraid most of Americans been calling her crooked for way before Bernie gained a Following.
@realDonaldTrump This is the correct way to handle this issue. &amp; should be adequate time.for the legislative branch to do their job. MAGA
@SenFeinstein Well go to work Madam Senator. The President should not just make a law he's allowed to veto it or pass it. Legislative act, not Executive.
@RepLouCorrea @HouseDemocrats No, there not. They are potential Americans, that is the good ones who qualify, and the bad ones that hide in shadows are criminals
@TheLastWord @KamalaHarris @Lawrence @MSNBC WOW, another uninformed simpleton will address the public on a issue they have not carefully researched? I can hardly wait.
@RightlyNews @jessebwatters Right, if they were actually trying to become citizens, they would know this.
Over 2 million acres of forestry is on fire in the country with only 22 thousand firefighters. They need our help. Please re-tweet
@repjoecrowley @HouseDemocrats @POTUS So you stand with the 120,000+ involved in criminal activities and the 2334+ gang related offenders. That makes you an accessory. Right?
@realDonaldTrump @SheriffClarke If they continue not doing there job, can we get a refund? I'm sure we can find another purpose for the $148,000,000.00+
@RepJoseSerrano @HouseDemocrats I would invite any immigrants that wishes to become a law abiding citizen the chance to. All unlawful acting immigrants should be deported.
@seanhannity Sooner or later we're going to have to make an example out of someone. Why not the fat kid?
@Clyburn @NancyPelosi So what you're saying is that we should defeat bad with bad? Dr king would differ. DACA allows the bad to hide in the shadows of the good.
@WalshFreedom @lovingmykids65 Yep, I believe it fall in his job description. Awesome right?
I find it amazing that some people will simply spu falsehood statements for ratings without researching the topics. Like popping a giant zit
@greenhousenyt @SenatorLeahy Do a little research, over 120,000 of these dreamers have been involved in criminal activity in which 3500 Weir gang related. There's more.
@SenRonJohnson I'm a professional problem solver, the basic problem is we are using the wrong tools for the job. We need to elect some different tools
@AbigailCBN @LindseyGrahamSC Research this carefully, most recipients are children, 22% have been involved in criminal activities with 3200+being gang related, exe..
The DACA program has some good people in it, but also has plenty of bad people as well. Let the good stay &amp; deport the bad. Build the wall
@lisamurkowski Please do what you can for the ones who deserve it. Also though, help make the guide lines to separate the bad ones so they can go.
@votevets @RepDonBeyer @realDonaldTrump Most likely not, but the 112,500 found to be involved in Criminal related activities &amp; the additional 4500+ involved in gang activities will
@SenSchumer The average DACA recipient is 25+ yrs. Old it takes roughly about 6 to 7 years to acquire citizenship. Why hasn't any of them done this?
@SenSchumer Well a lot of them has had the time to become citizens or at least start the process and because of DACA have avoided it to evade taxes.
@GenJohnKelly The coast of Michigan?
@LeroyGillam1 And can you imagine how broke they would be if we stop giving them all of our government subsidies?
I try to follow every elected representative hoping to find one who is truly deserving to hold such an distinguishing office. Still looking https://t.co/AV7QZEp2cD
@SteveBannen Turncoat politics seems to be the big trend these days. How can you be a leader if you ride on the coattails of the opposition? Sad
@WiredSources Yep this is standard, you have to remove the inner wall and insulation, sterilizes existing materials, and then rebuild
Any kind of anti-American propaganda should not be allowed in government-funded organizations. This includes our educational system
DACA effects 800,000 non US citizens, Heathcare effects over 300,000,000 US citizens. Does anyone else have a problem with this
@SteveBannen I have been a first responder in more than 6 natural disasters and know firsthand of how this organization functions. Sad
@SteveBannen Please look into the Red Cross and make sure they actually use more than 17% of the money donated this time around.
@SenGillibrand Really? So you and your snap personally interviewed all 800,000 of them. OK how many have applied for citizenship? Just wondering.
@AMike4761 @lovingmykids65 Right, he so use the following McCain he's going to follow him right out of the office
@mitchellvii @lovingmykids65 They will start up again soon. People remember if you criticize someone who's helping the masses in a natural disaster. It's Political death
@TimothyBair @lovingmykids65 @President1Trump Well I believe that is because they better paying jobs that way. Most of the women are seeking employment that doesn't require papers.
@SenGillibrand Yes it did. And now because of lack of action by our legislative branch over the last 5 years, they might lose everything.
@WalshFreedom I know, cool right? it kinda makes you wonder how long they have gone on unchecked and what damage to our lives they're responsible for.
@NILC_org @RepBarbaraLee Sure, start donating to all the Congress reps you know. If you donate enough, they might do something.
@U_Got_Trumped @NolteNC @woodseysmith Sure, if you can't appeal to the registered voters simply make more.
@StarChamberMaid @NolteNC Because they're lazy gas bags that only work to look good on camera. Sad, but in most cases, true
@President1Trump @POTUS Right, it's like forcing children to eat their greens. If you don't do your chores then no Xbox
@mitchellvii @lovingmykids65 Wow, and they almost put him in the WH.
@GovInslee If it's not cruel are you going 2 apologize? Of course not. How about let's wait &amp; see what is actually says, innocent until proven guilty
@GovInslee It is the removal of an unconstitutional executive order. You can't appeal it. Tell your federal representatives to go to work
@senorrinhatch What? I know that Congress moves slow but you have had 5 years to do this. Stop Promenade and go to work. What a dog and pony show.
@GovInslee No, we need to strengthen our borders so the vary things that our dreamers' families were fleeing won't follow. No snakes in the garden.
@GovInslee I concur
@GovInslee Yes, tell them  to do their job
@PattyMurray How many DACA participants became citizens? How many actually have had the chance but refuse to because of disqualification of free stuff?
I will always praise honorable intent as long as it doesn't promote disarray or division.
@PattyMurray Thank you Madame Senator. A true inspirational gratifying post. Keep up the great work
If you can't get voters to vote for your parties agenda, simply make new voters.
How can you call yourself a representative of the people if you only represent political party agenda and personal gain?	#truncoatrep.
All politician concerned with #DACA outcome, if you have done nothing for immigration reform in the past 5 years, don't start milking it now
@clayfeathers She doesn't have time for this, she still owes about 7 million Hillary voters thier BJob
@SteveBannen Can I make a suggestion to name one of the bombs?	We can call 1 deplorable diplomacy
@SenFeinstein Congress must work on our Healthcare, tax relief, and the safety of our country. You represent Americans first. If not resign.
@SteveBannen I concur, but sad to say not everybody possesses the same belief
@AMike4761 @lovingmykids65 If you're against the American way of life you need to leave.
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS It's not an attack it's more like an i-told-you-so. This is a time when our country needs our support. You are better than that.
@SteveBannen Should we start a taking a collection for her travel expenses?
@realDonaldTrump I love it when you tweet like this. It gives me the opportunity to block all the idiots
@realDonaldTrump No, it won't, even the majority of the North Korean population wants somebody to remove this tyrant.
@realDonaldTrump We will have to do something to ensure the safety of our children and future generations of all World citizens.
Thank you O lord for giving us a strength and courage to help our fellow man in need &amp; allow Comfort &amp; guidance to those you've called home
If we devoted as much energy into fixing the problems instead of crucifying each other. All of our problems would already be solved
@LisaCha17384243 @larryelder @FightandDebate Teachers need support from the educational system. And should be allowed to teach courses that are actually useful. Like Parenting 101
@larryelder @SheriffClarke Well it's because the  education system is outdated for any grade above the 6th grade. Students lose interest in generic curriculums. E-M me
@WiredSources Yeah, they've already made it quite clear that when it comes they'll be no warning. But I'm sure in the back of his mind he is expecting it
@KamalaHarris The situation must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. If we continue 2 group the whole situation as 1,then the good will suffer 4 the bad
@mmmparker3 @PattyMurray It was a temporary executive order so Congress would have time to revamp the immigration laws. Your beef is with congress not with Trump
@KPRC2 @JudgeTedPoe Yeah but the mayor said that schools would be reopen last Tuesday. You know when he was smiling on TV wild visiting a shelter for a photo op
@SenFeinstein I don't think we should generalize them as a group, those that have follow the program as intended should stay. Those that did not should go
@ReadyHarris @SenTedCruz @hcphtx Yes please try to do this it is very important when the flood waters come up they mixed with the sewage water. You have to kill the bacteria
@SteveBannen @WiredSources Most definitely will. Bipartisan I hope.
@SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP Our legislative branch should be paying close attention to this and learn from its example. This is what working together looks like.
@FWD_us @KamalaHarris @HallieJackson @NBCNightlyNews DACA was a temporary solution until Congress had enough time to fix the problem. Jesus and those like him have nothing to worry about.
@SteveBannen jim bridenstine seems to be someone who is good fit 4 the position. If this is what we're talking about, Rubio does things that are wrong
@SteveBannen Need more info, will be right back.
@mikebwonder @lovingmykids65 Sad.
@BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @usedgov Our education system is outdated. I'm looking 4 an open forum on revamping &amp; creating more opportunities 4 students &amp; teachers. suggestions?
@HollyHenderson9 Yeah, most of them are like that. Propaganda has an effect on the weak-minded.
@SenGillibrand It should be used in the early stages of the diagnostic process. You would most likely find out that it will eliminate the need for other Rx
@KidRockSenator @lovingmykids65 And after the conflict he did more than any other political figure to start the healing process and help integrate black people into society
@SparkleSoup45 @lovingmykids65 No, in any crisis situation, you first have to build a good foundation by taking care of your own, then you can help everyone else.
Smart people learn from their mistakes. Wise people learn from others mistakes. Buy erasing history your removing the ability to be wise.
@SenSchumer @USTreasury Is it there something more important we could be doing? Why don't we just print a $25 bill and put her on that. Problem solved.
@SenThomTillis It has been, 44 change some things &amp; 45 simply put them back. But yes there should be a few changes made.
@michaelkeyes @lovingmykids65 Yeah!!!, you just got love them boys.
@SteveBannen Yeah I thought the first address the president made on Saturday pretty much covered it.
@SenSchumer Yep, already know, my health insurance cost went up, and then no one would take it.Then they wanted to penalize me on my taxes. In 2016.
@SenSchumer Most definitely, we all know that some ppl in the Senate are more concerned about their party's political agenda than helping our citizens
@SheriffClarke Yep, just when you start putting down a Fondation, you find a little swamp land hidden in the survey.
@GenJohnKelly Sad but apparent.
@SenFeinstein That might be stretching it a bit. But I believe that we should review the issue on an individual bases
@SenFeinstein Your beating a dead horse, you're above this, so I hope. How about fighting the good fight for a change. United we stand divided we fall.
RT @DailyCaller: "What the f**k," @CNN? https://t.co/oPGzVg2zNv
@DailyCaller @CNN There you go, another bad judgement call. People who just been through a life-altering traumatic event don't want 2 B interviewed, psych 101
@HoustonTX @GenJohnKelly And so you shouldn't, we don't have too many issues with illegal immigration. What we have issues with our immigrants doing things illegal.
@pastormarkburns Have a safe trip, may God be with you on your travels
Local Beaumont news organization denied trapped victims outreach story because location not in there viewing area

@RealAlexJones @lovingmykids65 After all of the new NFL rulings and how they're treating this, I choose America. I never watch NFL again.
@James101376 @lovingmykids65 What we got to put up signs now, in my neck of the woods that practice is redundant.
@kwilli1046 Because they condone it. If you want to know how the left feels about hate, research there involvement n Germany in the 30s Adolf like them.
@nancymilholland @lisamurkowski @USCG I imagine it could for personnel but usually the US Navy doesn't handle Inland water issues they're just not equipped.
@lisamurkowski @USCG It would have had literally tens of thousands more if they would have had more than just five lines. Took 3 hours to get through.
@DTexasgal @tammiedortch @sean_spicier Of course 140 is not enough to list all the bad and illegal things that happened during Katrina. Most was due to delayed fed involvement
@tammiedortch @DTexasgal @sean_spicier This happened two days after the storm hit, I was here and I'm still here. Why do you think we have the Cajun Navy now
@DTexasgal @tammiedortch @sean_spicier Wow! And y'all thought with Sheriff Joe did was a crime.
@DTexasgal @tammiedortch @sean_spicier Please for the love of God y'all sue the hell out of him
@DTexasgal @sean_spicier Well the difference in New Orleans was Obama was on vacation at Martha's Vineyard and simply waited to address the issue when he returned.
@sean_spicier @lovingmykids65 I believe that u.s. citizens in  Houston Tx. can sue him for gross negligence because he put political hatred of POTUS  B4 their safety.
@hrtablaze @lovingmykids65 This is the same thing they were doing in the 30s, the only difference is they were doing it in Germany
@RealJamesWoods Wow it's like she just condone slavery.
@GenJohnKelly Most people don't know that the far left in the 1930s was supporting Hitler in Germany with political tactics to take over the government
@GenJohnKelly I don't believe that either, listen to this kind of rhetoric is like watching a storm drain, you never know what's coming out of it next
If you're in the Houston area and you are in need of help with evacuating please callCALL 2815171300, THEY NEED A physical address
Need evacuation assist phone numbers for Harrison County
@donna_heinrich @lovingmykids65 Trying to get threw to someone. Thier is 45 victims at Valley flag and Mesa in Harris County
@fema @SecretaryPerry Yes, but I have only been able to find six working phone numbers for hundreds of thousands of people and all have been busy for hours..
@GenJohnKelly @HillaryClinton @TheDemocrats They're just trying every option. It's past time that we all should Rise Above This. Right now SE Texas needs us all to be Americans.
@seanhannity Maybe you can do something about this, They're already price gouging. Please try to mention this in one of your broadcast. Un  humane https://t.co/fQdOmrExM4
@GenJohnKelly There's been a lot of that going around. I believe like all of my known veteran ancestors believed, we're all brothers and sisters.
@billoreilly One of the true blessings about being American is that you can have your own opinion Any group that represents hate should be abolished.
@realDonaldTrump Yep you can do that, they're going to pay for that wall one way or another. We support you all the way mr. President fight the good fight
@SheriffClarke That is Sheriff spell check in talk-to-text are not my friends. Nice hat
@SheriffClarke Keep them straight their share Clark.

@SenTedCruz @FoxNews They're price gouging.  Please address this Mr Senator, this is a true hate crime https://t.co/tRk9gaij4t
@HCSOTexas @SenTedCruz Please address this if ya'll can. It is illegal in my state to do this during a natural disaster. 300% markup https://t.co/j7xL5NAuSb
In ST TEXAS, some stores are changing almost $20.00 for a $6.00 case of water due to the life-threatening demands.
This is a real crime people. They are over charging by 300% for life essential requirements. They are holding Humanity hostage https://t.co/SsIgIx24Ds
@GenJohnKelly Please attend to this. This is a real crime https://t.co/xDUYEFiPrF
@mikemikovich @GenJohnKelly They might be, but due to our gender equality laws, we can't call him that anymore
@GenJohnKelly And their next targets are,	Religion	Family Values	Patriotism	Nobility	Pride	Honor	Oh and let's not forget common sense. There's more....
@SenBlumenthal Presidential pardons apply in all levels of law in the United States.
@KamalaHarris It shouldn't be an issue, you only have to stay the physical gender that you are while serving. Do what you want on your own time &amp; dime
@GenJohnKelly I believe that this will be the absolute best candidate for the job go Sheriff Joe
@p1nkobs3ssion @thehill Thank you, I was trying to find a polite way of of stating just that
@GenJohnKelly @GeorgeTakei Not quite sure General but I'll look into it for you,
@KamalaHarris That is an accurate, the sheriff was doing his job following protocol set for by ICE. I hope this is accurate, you're better than this?
@GenJohnKelly Wow I believe dr. King would be so proud
@RealJamesWoods @AnnCoulter The parents should sue the school.
The people of SE Texas needs your support &amp; prayers. It is time for Unity. It's time to be a true American. #1blood
@unclescorpie @GenJohnKelly No, we don't want our tax dollars to pay for sex changes.
@GenJohnKelly I concur on the transgender issue. And I don't believe that the hurricane reach a category 4 level.
@SenFeinstein Prosecutors &amp; judges are there to follow the letter of the law. Not for their own political advancement or party agenda. You are above this
@SenFeinstein So he was doing his job as a public servant following guidelines set forth by ice. Not trying to promote a political agenda. How's your job?
@SenFeinstein He is being incarcerated because of the manipulation of law. He was following Federal protocol (laws). He was a public servant doing his job
@GenJohnKelly Isn't she a card, she'll be the first one trying to get a FEMA check and also will be the last one to help anyone. Sad
@AnnCoulter I want to believe it, but so far lawmakers aren't really impressive right now. The swap has a slightly clogged drain.
@DeMarko_Gage @RepMaxineWaters Sure he does, he just might not care about the same parts of America way of life that you do.
@DeMarko_Gage @RepMaxineWaters What does that mean? We all know there's a problem. But if you offer no way to fix it, then you two were just part of the problem. #1blood
@RepMaxineWaters I believe you based your career speaking up for those he truly need help. Too bad it was only for your political and economical gain. 1blood
@sean_spicier @GenJohnKelly Although this is an apprising solution to some of our problems, we will already have plenty of trash to clean up after this.
@SenBlumenthal Since the laws are to protect our citizens, and he was following the rules of one of our Federal enforcement agencies, what's the issue?
@SenSchumer @POTUS What? How can you link these 2 events? I really thought you were better than that. Turns out they were right. Stop being part of the problem
@ByronYork @AnnCoulter Should have used the money allocated for the pumps to fix the pumps. Wait till the people of New Orleans find out they can sue the city.
@FoxNews @KellyannePolls Right, they only seem to put out the propaganda it supports their agenda of division. Sounds like a bunch of Nazis to me
@occdissent @AnnCoulter I believe it's time we put an end to this. Vandalism of federal property is a felony. No matter what your political opinion is.
Here's one,He or She who is not guilty of personal gain through  political appointment can throw first stone. As expected no flying stones.
@SenatorDurbin @RepGutierrez If their cities not following the rules like my city, then they shouldn't give my tax dollar. That would be taxation without representation.
@SenatorDurbin Your right, they shouldn't. So when they upper hand someone who's illegal, they should contact ice and they'll Deport them. Any questions?
@Stump4TrumpPAC What an idiot! It was a police officer that shot you in the no no, not a Nazi. Look for a positive take away, oh! Unable to spawn hopefully
@Stump4TrumpPAC I know right, good shot! Some people just don't know how to accessorize to match the event.
@lovingmykids65 The wall will reduce School enrollment, present more unskilled work opportunities reduce where to infrastructure. Build the wall
@hughhewitt @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I concur. Haven't watched the cable TV program of any sort since 2014
A panel of bipartisan constitutional Scholars should address the voting issues. Not elected officials.  let's keep it honest.
More than half of our Representatives are millionaires, they all make over $174,000 a year, and get health care cost reduction credit
@GOP @POTUS Though it will probably receive very little press, it is actions such as this that makes him honorable. Thank you Mr. President
Some of the greatest Scholars of humanity possesses no formal education. And most of our biggest threats derives from the best of the latter
@WhiteHouse Which is exactly what a commander-in-chief should do. Most critics have no true understanding of the responsibilities of the office.
@joshdcaplan @lovingmykids65 This is a disrespectful media practice. Elected officials should not be treated in this manner. Try contacting her office as instructed.
@ArmyChiefStaff @FightingFirst Keep up the great work. All of us Real Americans support all of your efforts.
Encouraging others by falsehoods to elevate your political agenda goes against the core principles of being an American. Grow up
@NancyPelosi Right so it's all their fault. If you support your political agenda and put it before the people. Then you two are part of the problem.
@SenatorCarper @POTUS And save billions in healthcare, government assistance programs, and our carbon footprint
@SenatorCarper @POTUS Building a wall through the desert where nothing grows already would offer some type of shading and release two indigenous species
@SenatorCarper @POTUS Please elaborate. For starters if they can climb a wall. So just the physical health of the illegal aliens would save us on Healthcare
@LindseyGrahamSC Thank you this is one of the first post I've read this morning that was positive. Keep up the great work and fight the good fight
@SkeptiCatz @realDonaldTrump Yeah, that will never happen have a nice day
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump I feel that you fall under the category of one of those whiners. Try doing something positive that promotes Unity. You'll feel better for it
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump I'm not sure he actually types, I believe most of his response or talk to text and which has no perimeters for proper grammar
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump Not really feeling it, oh that's because I basically don't care.
@realDonaldTrump What is really sad is that you have to explain yourself like you're talking to children which is understandable because they are.
@realDonaldTrump It's such a pitiful thing. Anyone who knows anything about public speaking would see this as self-explanatory. They're causing the division
@pawliticks @marinafang @HuffPostPol The government disperses Stevens to fund all salaries and projects quarterly. It doesn't happen at the president don't sign. Get the picture
@MageeWyvette @marinafang @SenatorLeahy We're simply going to deduct it from the 50 billion dollar Staffing they get every year from us. Believe me they will still accept the check
@SidneyTucker666 @marinafang @HuffPostPol Even if we do pay for the construction, the economical losses to Mexico will endure far greater. No more freebies
@spartasteven @marinafang @SenatorLeahy All good things come in time. And you can expect this one to take a little while due to the opposition.
@LomanGinyard @marinafang @SenatorLeahy @realDonaldTrump @EPN It would be smarter for them to pay for the wall instead of receiving all the new deficiencies their economy will suffer because they didn't
@Glsantangelo @marinafang @HuffPostPol The blow to their economy because of such a thing will be ten times fold whatever any wall would cost
@Glsantangelo @marinafang @HuffPostPol Well it will prevent their criminal element from being deposited on our soil, removal of free trade agreements, and U.S. companies departing
@bonobobarbie @marinafang @HuffPostPol Did you think of this one all by yourself? Way more people has had horrible life-changing events due to this then what has been reported
@UcheNwakudu @marinafang @HuffPostPol Not sure where you're going with this. Try posting before you take your medication next time.
@marinafang @SenatorLeahy They will, one way or another. I trust whatever the wall cost will be far less then the losses on their economic future then if they don't.
@davis1988will @lovingmykids65 Although a little vague, the first response was the right one. As president his must not represents segregation in any way shape or form
@RaheemKassam Well yes because they are. The definitions or Code buried in the immigration Act States clearly the behaviors of a terrorist. Spot on
@perfectsliders @lovingmykids65 Okay so I get to pick from a guy who sabotage Ben Carson, a defender of a rapist, a socialist, or a successful businessman. Real no-brainer
@GenJohnKelly Still in all, great shot. Anyway we can arrange some kind of accommodation for the guy with the launcher?
@GenJohnKelly I always say you should dress appropriately for the occasion. See what happens when you're ill equipped. You end up with smoked oysters
Howard Dean, you are now part of the problem. You don't have the True Life Experiences to speak on this subject. Crawl back in your hole.
@GenJohnKelly Right it's like their constitution looks like a redacted X-File. They follow only amendment sections that supports their actions
@lovingmykids65 Thank God I finally found another human.
@GenJohnKelly As a self-proclaimed speaker of the people yes we definitely loved it.
@GenJohnKelly Their agenda is pretty clear isn't it.
@invisibleman_17 @HoldMyBeerGif Well what did he expect you had a gas mask on. Who brings a gas mask to a peaceful protest? They don't do crap for a gut-check though
@Tess_Holliday Because when you're mad you make bad decisions. By promoting such actions you are also promoted chaos. Are you trying to be a terrorist?
@Rosie1618 Having fun supporting hatred? So who did you want to be president?
It's easy to look for opportunities to hate. It's even easier to justify the hatred within oneself. Righteousness never takes the low road
@GenJohnKelly All the storefronts down the Avenue right there would appreciate that. Eventually an example will have to be made to violent protesters.
@sparky16726 @4853_254 @WaltMD @seanhannity @POTUS Elementary, vocalization surpassing commoners comprehension equates and revise opportunities four oxen feces. Any questions
@seanhannity @POTUS Not sure, are the signs going to be an English this time? But you should film it so you will have a video record of the illegal aliens here
@zizorn @PrisonPlanet @CNN No I believe in Texas they have the right to shoot him. Sometimes you got to love Texas
@PrisonPlanet @AnnCoulter @CNN In a public park, so now they're putting children In Harm's Way.Hurt one of my kids, &amp; I will show you the true definition of a hate crime.
@MAGANIFICENT @JackPosobiec @MicroChunkyChip @Cernovich @bakedalaska These are my only options?
@AnnCoulter Yes it was. But he did not added to his agenda until Trump started commenting on immigration issues and building the wall.
@GOP What? Where I'm from normal people take the bus
@AnnCoulter The biggest problems with Afghanistan is that there's not enough flat land to build a Walmart, a really good bowling alley, or a Holiday Inn
@AnnCoulter The coverage of this has been somewhat diluted over the past 8 years. But basically it is to suppress Jihad tendencies. Only my thoughts
@IJaegermeister @SpeakerRyan I've been trying to think of a very polite way to comment on your statement. Still nothing
@SpeakerRyan Thank you Mr Speaker, this is the message that the silent majority is behind keep up the good work and fight the good fight God bless
@marcorubio Yep and boy how they whine, kick, and scream when this happens
@GenJohnKelly Awesome, got to love it. Anything better simply would not do.
@BetsyDeVos Where would be the best place to offer some reform ideas for our outdated education system
@brucebarbet2 @SenatorTimScott Yes our school systems are broken and are teaching ideologies are extremely outdated. Thank you for being a true teacher of Truth
@SenatorTimScott I know you don't represent my state at the moment, but I am proud of your efforts. Continue the great work Mr. Senator.
We all have it in ourselves to be good and to do what's right. It is a shame all this hatred among ourselves. Lead by example, rise above.
@SpeakerRyan Speak the word Mr Speaker. I am totally against all forms of racism. Because of this, all groups think I'm on the other side. America first
@lynnc358 @JoshuaGreen @maddow Yep, he cares about all of us, even those who oppose him. Because that's what Presidents do.
@JoshuaGreen @maddow Who cares, what were more interested in is who is your three sources
@kwgole_kevin @GenJohnKelly @GeorgeTakei Someone had to go dark boat or something? I can't believe that this just simply happened. Usually everybody's paying attention in this area
@GenJohnKelly @GeorgeTakei Yes this is strange. International rules states that the bigger ship has the right away due to maneuverability issues. Plenty more questions
@LeroyGillam1 It's like throwing one Doubloon into a big crowd of people at Mardi Gras, they all just go for it without thinking about the consequences
@LeroyGillam1 You do realize that most people who voted 4 Trump don't belong 2 any type of group at all &amp; are entertained by those who think they do
@LeroyGillam1 In some areas, they already embrace the type of equality of life that we are fighting for. (1blood) Only One race the human race.
@MAGANIFICENT @RedPillBlack Okay that border line on perv. Sorry about that spell check and talk to text or not my friends. So back to the formal. I agree with you
@MAGANIFICENT @RedPillBlack You sound like you're from my neighborhood. But I know you're not because there's no way in the world I would have you.♡U all ready
@KamalaHarris I concur, this free markets entity truly should be reevaluated. Way to address the hard issues keep up the good fight Madam Senator
@AnnCoulter You know I love you right? Most people call this outspoken but really it's just the absence of certain filters that I deem unnecessary
@GenJohnKelly Totally agree, I believe that Saturday was the most presidential statement I ever heard from any president addressing such matters.
@GenJohnKelly Right, if you swing real hard sir the ball will slice and you have more opportunity for contact. Hope this information was helpful
@GenJohnKelly Yes sir, no doubts.Keep up the great work and continue to lead us on the path of good fight. Hope you have success in all your endeavors.
@ArmyChiefStaff @gen_lawrence And what an independence it is, and it's amazing how all religious groups and political sides pulled together behind 1 idea. Sounds familiar
@KamalaHarris No child should be treated poorly due to their skin tone. We cannot let our children down. It is one of our greatest responsibilities.
@realDonaldTrump Working on that Mr President, and I will do so to my dying breath. We are all Americans no matter our skin tone. OneBlood
@SenBobCasey @realDonaldTrump Because you have to be against all of it for any of it to apply. All forms of racial Supremacy is what he said. That means all of it
@LeroyGillam1 Sir you are rapidly becoming my hero. Doctor King himself could not have said it better. My prayers are with you in all of your endeavors
@MAGANIFICENT I find that it's a necessary move, however it won't cease the rhetoric. So many negative agendas working towards our demise. God help us all
@AnnCoulter This is ridiculous, so like No Child Left Behind, this is another attack on our school system to make our children more stupid. D- evolution
@SpeakerRyan Thank you Mr. Speaker, great work. These are actions we all desperately need. Fight the good fight and God bless
One country under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Does anybody lobby for this anymore? Stop being part of the problem. Sad
It's my one-week anniversary on Twitter. I was truly uninformed on where most of our government officials truly stand. Disgraceful.
Just a couple of things I remember growing up, sticks and stones, takes one to know one, &amp;  most important, united we stand divided we fall
@LindseyGrahamSC @votetimscott Yes &amp; N these times it is always heartfelt to hear such historical remarks stated by such a distinguished gentleman. We need more like him
@jerweber @JoeNBC Are you aware The American National Socialist Party( neo-nazis) help start the original Black Panther Party in the 60s? All racism is bad.
@JoeNBC All racism and Supremacy is wrong. Regardless the color of our skin. Oh wait I'm sorry I forgot about your ratings, say what U want. 1blood
@marcorubio Thought without understanding is a dangerous thing. Thank you  for posting this Mr Senator. Great work in fighting the good fight
@AnnCoulter Incredible really wish I was in that room.
@LeroyGillam1 Are you serious?!? they're threatening the mother? I fear it is time to make an example, sad sad day. Something will be done. Stay true Doc.
@KamalaHarris In my area people are having their homes take away because it can't afford $15,000 a year increase 4 mandatory flood insurance requirements.
Less than 3% of BC recipients are prescribed users 4 life-saving issues. All of the rest use it to prevent life.
@SenatorTimScott @vicenews By removing these statues, plaques, &amp; names of structures/thoroughfares feels as though we are trying 2 hide with these evil men have done.
@SenatorTimScott @vicenews Thank you Mr Senator 4 giving a southern perspective to this tragic topic. Your words Echo the meaning of how we see these ill-gotten items
@SenBlumenthal @senrobportman Great job Mr Senator. Keep up the great work fighting the good fight
@TuckerCarlson @Nigel_Farage @FoxNews Right it's amazing, most of these groups want the statues remove so you can forget what they represent so you won't recognize it next time
@seanhannity Please air them and air them often. Reality check is required
@SenGillibrand I concur, sad thing is when representatives of nobility use it as an opportunity to amplify shortcomings into deception.UR 1 of the great 1s
@SenDeanHeller Thank you Mr. Senator 4 your heartfelt remarks. I wish all politicians knew how to recognize moral issues &amp; refrain from promoting rhetoric
@SenSchumer President Trump has denounced his stuff now only several times this week but several times throughout his life, do what you want with Bannon
@JoeNBC All forms of Supremacy , in the big picture. I know you are above this. As president he has to represent the rights all. 1blood
@realDonaldTrump I agree, even if the statue serves as a reminder to us of what not to do. Reminds me of the book burnings.
@KamalaHarris This is so true, and is most likely the reason why the list two presidents were elected. We are all praying for guidance on your endeavors
@AnnCoulter Yes that coincides with what I believed the definition of love is to that group. Wait, has group been classified as a hate word yet?
@SenDuckworth Another awesome Mr Senator, keep up the great work and fight the good fight
@realDonaldTrump Awesome happy Hunting
@KamalaHarris That's it? They were projecting it was going to do this all by itself anyway. It's up to the legislative branch to correct this. America1st
@SenatorHeitkamp @UNDSMHS Sounds amazing, keep up the great work Madam Senator
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews I concur, go get them Tucker, fight the good fight
@SenDeanHeller @POTUS Awesome we do need to invest more in education. But I do believe that we need to work on how we go about educating our youth.
@seanhannity Every chance I get. Go get them Sean.
@amyklobuchar @JohnCornyn @SenDeanHeller @SenBennetCO Thank God we have such wonderful people such as yourself helping to write the ship of humanity. Great work Madam Senator
@CarleiAlise I would say what a sick joke you got to be at least 30 years younger than me. But you're still so adorable.
@realDonaldTrump I wish I could, but it is still not within my economical means. Stay safe Mr. President we are counting on you. Fight the good fight, 1blood
@SenatorDurbin Wow really? Sat.'so statement was spot on. It was constitutional &amp; bipartisan. Dr. King stated there is only one race the human race. 1blood
@realDonaldTrump @DeptVetAffairs @SecShulkin Great job POTUS. We must never forget or leave behind our most Nobelist Patriots especially in the times they need us the most.
@SenSchumer Allowing Americans to suffer due to lack of bipartisan on critical issues so political agendas can be achieved is beneath you. Lead us Unity
@seanhannity , yep in my neck of the woods we call that premature procrastination.
@SenGillibrand Concur once again spell check and talks to text or not my friends
@SenGillibrand I totally could curb Madam Senator. Keep up the great work.
@SenGillibrand I don't see it that way. It's a reminder of our in deferences and how we can overcome hatred diversity. By removal he is forgotten/ paroled
@seanhannity His first response on saterday was the right one according to the Constitution. The others where for the constitutional challenged. 1blood
@SenatorTimScott I concur, thank you for all the great work you do.Fight the good fight,
@bearsandgiants @SenWhitehouse Yes yes it does
@MFaraino @SenWhitehouse That's strange last public official I seen clapping like that it's a dictator in North Korea
@SenWhitehouse Wow really? He condemned all hate groups and forms of Supremacy on Saturday. You are above this Mr Senator. Fight the good fight. 1blood
@RoyBlunt I concur, It's like having a third world country inside our own. Let no American be left behind. Keep up the great work Mr	 Senator.
@PhilipMeowlowe @SenBlumenthal You can't and still Unity by lobbying for separation. Fight the good fight, you're better than that Mr Senator
@SenBlumenthal He dimmed all violence, hate groups, and forms of Supremacy. They could have just removed it quietly. You're better than that Mr Senator
@LeroyGillam1 The statement was referring to Chief Clark but I will Google you right now and I do believe in giving kudos to those who deserve. 1blood
@sbauerAP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr Senator for patriotic Gardens for our President. Keep up the great work and fight the good fight.

@Red_Maddog @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC To protect our freedoms as so he should be.
@urbanactors @Morning_Joe @JoeNBC @morningmika Yep see what ratings do
@Morning_Joe @JoeNBC Wow really? According to all pass interviews with Donald on this subject opposes your statement. Must suck to be you
@JohnKasich Thank you Sir for all that you do. Stay true and keep up the good fight
@jpodhoretz @JoeNBC Oh my God a typo my editor must be sleeping
@jpodhoretz @JoeNBC And this means what? Please clarify your meeting so the rest of us will know where you stand.
@rendale @tedcruz Please if you don't mind, what exactly is his agenda?
@tedcruz Thank you Mr Senator for all that you do. Fight the good fight
@KatTimpf Wow so your saying is that 80 of them supported you and your thoughts. Good thing you're not the president, someone might point that out
@SenCapito @SFWV All of our prayers and best intentions go with you Madam Senator have a great day
@WillieGeist @JoeNBC @NicolleDWallace @Morning_Joe And also will limit their ability to grow a spine &amp; or be part of the solution. All sicknesses are cured from within. Fight the good fight
@realDonaldTrump What's the technology on the world today there's no excuse for Amazon not applying local taxes based on the shipping address of the buyer
@ChefGibson @williamlegate @Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump I know it sucks but as president he has to defend all citizens constitutional rights. Even uninformed one. Does this make you feel fuzzy?
@williamlegate @Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump Wow is this a front of your house? That was me I apologize. See how that's done? Now you try
@Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump Please research your history! Before you can grant a title like that you should be familiar with all the presidents. Uninformed statements.
@Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump Wow really? Please research your history on the political agenda of North Korea towards the USA. I'm hoping you're better than that.
@Impeach_D_Trump @realDonaldTrump You do realize claiming The High Ground on moral statues that you don't really possess is a form of Supremacy, right?
@realDonaldTrump Thank you mr. President for all that you do. Sometimes you have to bully the bully so they will leave the the rest alone.
@SoDamnTrue Wow all summer really, I managed to work for 32 years and I'm in the same boat.
@seanhannity Awesome, it is impressive to see someone speak dignified regardless of all the rhetoric.
Nothing boost my pride &amp; patriotism to our great country more than an actual bipartisan message from our great senators God bless you all
Search your inner self for your patriotism, Humanity, &amp; the goodness of your heart. Represent the views of your constituents not your party.
@KamalaHarris Humanity, spell check and talk-to-text are not my friends
@KamalaHarris Wow I had no idea. Thank God you Manatee wins again. Thank you for the good news. Keep up the great work &amp;  fight the good fight.
@GeminijlwWilson @RepLanceNJ7 I concur, thank you. Instead of unity they're promoting division to our faces and behind our backs. They could fix it if they actually cared
@RepLanceNJ7 @JoeNBC All forms of Supremacy are evil. United we stand divided we fall. Notice how you separated the words America and the GOP. Future prediction?
Being a US senator is one of the highest honors in the land. Lead by example. Avoid opportunities to promote rhetoric. Fight the good fight
@ResistNow17 @JoshMeyerDC @xscoutie @politico Good right or were you suggesting something else.
@JoshMeyerDC @JoeNBC @politico Because like all terrorist groups they only here what they want to here to help promote their agenda. True to self, to the country
@SenatorHassan @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Can you think of one mainstream term with the word white in it that is positive? all Supremacy is considered terrorism. Fight the good fight
Dr. King said that we are all One race, the human race. Don't promote problems, offer Solutions in guidance We're All in This Together.
@SenBlumenthal Didn't he just do that? You're right it is time for all us to unite. So let's not make our way as part of problem, your are better than that
@SenBlumenthal I concur acts like this does only threaten our American way of life and principles. Should be treated as a terrorist Act. Excellent work sir
@SenBlumenthal Wow, really? No form of Supremacy is acceptable including this one. Lead by example. Dr. King said Promote Unity not division.
@SenGillibrand Thank you for all you do Madam senator
@SpeakerRyan All forms of Supremacy are not acceptable. Dr. King stated that we are all one race, the human race. Don't promote segregation. Rise above.
@JerryMoran No form of supremecy should be acceptable. Dr King stated we are all but one race. The human race. Labels only promotes division. Rise above
Anyone can identify problems with little or no effort. But if you actually have a real plausible solution to the problems, priceless...
@KamalaHarris All supremacists. Labels causes division. We are all equal. &amp; now we need to be as one #trueamerican
@WhennBoys Right here!!! Just along for the ride....lol
@JoeNBC What? Stop being part of the problem. He shouldn't of resign. Political unexperienced doesn't condemn him to your accusations #truamerican
@SoDamnTrue Me three
@SoDamnTrue That was awesome you made me smile
The only true constant in society is change. Even acceptable change may have ill consequences. True fairness doesn't come from falsehoods.
@FACEITFOTO @SenatorCollins Have you read the Constitution? There's not one thing in the Constitution that refers to healthcare #trueAmerican
@SenBlumenthal Or lack of political experience. Nobody really liked Lincoln either. Please help in fixing not creating problems. #trueAmerican

@realDonaldTrump Thanks Mr President. I'm waiting for the dims and Reps to realize that you are a true American. And not realy with any side.#trueamerican
@SenBlumenthal Good publicity &amp; bad publicity is still publicity. I can see why he didn't name them at first. Stop planting seeds of hate #trueAmerican
@SenatorCollins @CharterGov Awesome Madam senator thank you for tweeting something positive about your community you keep up the awesome job #true American
@realDonaldTrump And I just told Bernie to stop planting seeds of hate.  #trueamerican.
@realDonaldTrump Yep it's sad. How can we overcome this if they leave when it gets tough. We believe in and support you mr. president #trueamerican
@SenSanders I didn't see him actually send that message is this an assumption? Stop planning hate seeds. Stop all the name calling. #trueamerican
