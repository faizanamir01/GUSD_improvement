@robtomorrow @PoliticallyRYT @POTUS If you knew anything about the "Antifa" of 2018 in America, you'd be saying you endorse Communism! This Antifa Group is Not a group of people you should be proud of! Do some research, you'll shit your pants if you dig deep enough. I have links to their groups if you want them!
Multiple news outlets are using portions of this AP story and omitting portions that entirely change the dynamics of the story! Check comments!	https://t.co/14aBWgJ2zT https://t.co/g27luWgTCu

@realLucyAmato @PoliticallyRYT @robtomorrow @POTUS Note... this is the full AP article https://t.co/hNi91oOveY
@realLucyAmato @PoliticallyRYT @robtomorrow @POTUS She said ANTIFA, not anti-fascist, big difference between this group of mental wack jobs and being anti-fascist! If you don't know the difference do a little research!
@robtomorrow @PoliticallyRYT @POTUS Either, way no matter your political views they both are bad!
