Let’s start the impeachment process!! Let Mueller do his thing! All the other prosecutors do their investigation and charges, but congress MUST START IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS ! He has to be REMOVED ASAP!!😡🔥

@jenbeccyRN IKR?!?! 😡🔥
@jenbeccyRN I know! I am worried! I agree with some people who have been calling for impeachment proceedings to start! I AGREE 100 percent!!!
RT @jenbeccyRN: @trigg_christine I don’t think Mueller will indict Trump. I think we’re gonna have to Impeach him.
RT @jenbeccyRN: @trigg_christine He’s committed a long list of Impeachable Offenses
I for one am going to start reporting his tweets!! We ALL need to put pressure on Twitter!! Listen to the fat fuck comment about the coast guard terrorist! Trump thinks his language is “ NICE”!!🔥😡🔥😡 ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!😡🔥😡🔥
@jenbeccyRN As far as trump, I think it’s time for TWITTER to step up and ban his hate speech!! I get put in Twitter jail for calling a MAGA moron a name, but trump is constantly attacking people, name calling, Lying and inciting, encouraging VIOLENCE!! Why is he not banned?!?!😡🔥😡🔥
@jenbeccyRN I am Sick and tired of these Lowlife, white trash MAGA MORONS!! The FBI Is investigating the idiots and you know that the intelligence community is pretty pissed by being constantly attacked by trump! I hope they are making it their top priority ( besides RUSSIA) to handle this

As far as Joe MANCHIN, Doug Jones and Kristen Sinema voting WITH THE REPUBLICANS, to confirm Barr, WE WILL REMEMBER THIS VOTE!!🔥🔥 MANCHIN , as usual, voted against his own party 🔥🤬😡 Doug Jones and Kristen Sinema have shown us that they have no progressive values!!🔥🔥
Every republican voted for BARR , never demanding that he protect Mueller and the investigation into the INSTALLATION OF AN ACTIVE RUSSIAN ASSET IN OUR WHITE HOUSE!🔥All Republicans are totally and completely invested in keeping power, even at the expense of our Democracy!🔥
The sacred oath they ALL took, to DEFEND OUR COUNTRY , AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC, is meaningless!!🔥We MUST vote every single republican out of power ! We MUST cleanse this country of ALL these republican traitors! No more chances for Susan Collins!🔥🔥 ENOUGH!
This man should NEVER have been confirmed as Attorney General! NEVER! He refused to recuse from the trump/ Russia investigation! This alone should have been enough to disqualify him, but republicans have NO honor, decency or respect for our constitution!!🔥🔥
William Barr is NOW the Attorney General , with the power to shut down the Mueller probe!🔥 The evil, maniacal positioning of corrupt and partisan toadies is breathtaking!! Barr was the A.G. who told George H. Bush to pardon ALL the crooks involved in the Iran- Contra crime’s!🔥
