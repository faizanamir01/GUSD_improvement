.@realDonaldTrump has called me crazy once again for supporting the #GreenNewDeal. His incoherent criticism is on par with other climate change deniers who also seem scared silly to face the facts of climate change.
Republicans hurt women. Now they're condemning women who  face the agonizing decision of needing a late term abortion. Compassion and understanding are called for in this situation - it is not the time for the heavy hand of government to reach into our wombs. #HowDareYou
The hard truth is that the Republican Party hurts women. They demonize them for their medical needs, cut off crucial health care, and they create loopholes to allow businesses to exclude coverage. To make sure these efforts stick, they pack the courts. https://t.co/Lno1ikqojP
.@realDonaldTrump thinks that the same kind of flattery that works on him works on everyone else. Outcome at #HanoiSummit proves otherwise. Diplomacy through narcissism, rather than extensive preparation, doesn't work.
Let me be clear: infanticide is already illegal. This bill continues Republicans' ceaseless efforts to push a false narrative to achieve their goals of shaming women, criminalizing doctors, and ending a woman's right to a safe, legal abortion. https://t.co/JHgMCFK1F4

Confronting the challenge of climate change requires a comprehensive approach to transforming our country in a way that prioritizes environmental health and wellness, while also expanding opportunity and creating good-paying jobs as we transition to a low carbon economy.
From committing to 100 percent renewable energy, to embracing a carbon neutral economy, Hawaii has taken aggressive action to combat climate change because of the threat it poses to our way of life.

Donald Trump needs to face the reality that he won’t get $5 billion for his wall and accept responsibility for keeping the government running.
But at the 11th hour, Donald Trump succumbed to pressure from his far right-wing base and chose to shut down the government for a $5 billion down payment on his vanity wall. This shutdown is totally unfair, completely unnecessary, and entirely the President’s fault.
Two nights ago, the Senate did its job by passing a bill to keep the government open with the expectation that the House would pass it and that the President would sign it into law.

It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible and I believe her.

No one should forget that @SenateMajLdr changed Senate rules for the expressed purpose of confirming Donald Trump’s ideologically-driven nominees with the barest majority rather than the 60 votes required for previous Supreme Court nominees.
Kavanaugh has advocated that Congress legislate to exempt U.S. presidents from civil and criminal actions while in office. This is of deep concern at a time when Donald Trump is a defendant in numerous civil lawsuits and is the subject of a significant criminal investigation.
As a federal appellate court Judge, Kavanaugh’s record is replete with decisions favoring the privileged and powerful. His writings &amp; rulings show a determination to restrict reproductive freedom &amp; strip federal agencies of their power to protect our water, air, and safety.

Andrew Wheeler is a former fossil fuel industry lobbyist and shares Mr. Pruitt’s hostility to the EPA’s core mission of protecting the air we breathe &amp; the water we drink. He is another wrong choice to lead this critically important agency on either an interim or permanent basis.
Scott Pruitt exemplified the toxic mixture of corruption and hostility to government we’ve come to expect from the Trump administration. I joined 38 other Democratic Senators in calling for his resignation in April, and I certainly welcome his long-overdue resignation today.

I’m calling on everyone to make sure that the next person who sits on the Supreme Court bases their decisions on law, the facts, precedent, and overall upholding the Constitution and American values we all share. https://t.co/2Etq2BU1fI
Should there be hearings, I will exercise my Constitutional duty to determine whether any nominee appointed will respect the law, the Constitution, and American values.
Donald Trump has vowed that the Supreme Court should always remain Republican. The Supreme Court should be above politics, qualified, and exercise fair and independent judgment.
A nominee that is intent on carrying out the right-wing ideology of the President and his most extreme supporters.
If the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court is anything like the nominees he’s been sending to the lower federal court, I expect that we will see a nominee hand-picked by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.
The Court’s decision continues an assault funded by far-right groups on working people. We must fight back. Joined by my Senate and House colleagues, I’ll be introducing a bill to establish the right of every public sector employee to join a union and bargain collectively.
The partisan, political decision from the Supreme Court in #Janus will undermine public sector unions’ ability to fight for these basic protections for the 17.3 million public employees they represent.
America’s public sector workers teach and nurture our children, keep us safe, and care for our families. As #union members, they are empowered through collective action to fight for fair wages and work conditions.

I will continue to fight against this president’s reprehensible actions that dehumanize immigrants, tear families apart, and undermine our country’s moral leadership.
What’s happening to these children feels personal to me. Like so many people, I’ve found that my anger and emotions about this issue aren’t far below the surface.
Congress has a responsibility to repair our broken immigration system – and we tried hard in 2013 with months of hard work and bipartisan compromise.	We cannot and should not enact a patchwork solution that enshrines Donald Trump’s hatred and fear of immigrants into law.
There is nothing in the law that requires a zero-tolerance approach at the border – it was a choice that Donald Trump and his administration made. And these children are suffering the consequences. The President’s actions are unnecessary and cruel – but they aren’t surprising.
The President of the United States and his administration are playing games with the lives of innocent children. Tonight, my colleagues and I are on the floor opposing family separation and detention. Watch live here: https://t.co/u0FNiF4gpT		#HandcuffsForAll

The President chose to end DACA. The President chose to torpedo a bipartisan compromise to protect Dreamers. He created this mess. https://t.co/R9rSeN1x8g
With this threat, the President made it clear that he wanted all of us to stand with him against the Rounds-King amendment. That, I would not do.
President Trump created this crisis when he cancelled DACA and threw 800,000 young people under the bus. And with his recent veto threat, he has made it abundantly clear that protecting Dreamers is the farthest thing from his mind.
The Rounds-King amendment included a number of provisions I strongly oppose, including $25 billion for Trump’s wall. The Republicans also sought to dismantle our legal, family-based immigration system. Democrats fought hard to limit the damage.
Unfortunately, we were left with only one option to protect the 800,000 current DACA recipients and an additional one million Dreamers who the President has threatened with deportation. It’s for them that I voted for the Rounds-King amendment.
I have consistently supported a clean DREAM Act, and voted in favor of the Coons-McCain amendment today that came very close to it. And while it earned the support of a bipartisan group of 52 senators, the vast majority of Republicans blocked this effort.

There is no question that an open debate on immigration will be a knock-down, drag-out fight. There is an urgent need to protect DREAMers, and we can’t lose sight of this in the upcoming debate.
At the same time, Mitch McConnell promised on the Senate floor today that he would hold an open debate on DACA and immigration if no compromise is reached by the time this CR ends on February 8. We should all expect the Majority Leader to honor this promise.
My consistent position has been to oppose any continuing resolution that did not include these priorities. I voted against this CR for this reason.
I’m confident that we can reach bipartisan agreement on these issues and it was completely unnecessary for the President and Congressional Republicans to force a shutdown on them.
There are battles worth fighting. Protecting DREAMers, reauthorizing CHIP, funding Community Health Centers, and providing parity between funding for defense and domestic priorities – without pitting one against the other – were battles worth fighting.

Republicans are in charge of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. They are in charge of setting the time table and the agenda, and now they’re blaming the Democrats for their own misplaced priorities.
At the same time, they’ve ignored reauthorizing CHIP, funding Community Health Centers, protecting DREAMers, and providing parity between defense and non-defense programs. All of these issues have bipartisan support and should have gotten done months ago.

But no longer. We can only create a culture where women are respected as equals if we all step forward and be part of the change by holding everyone, especially our leaders, accountable.
My hope is that this moment for a cultural change will result in women no longer being viewed as objects or toys, but recognized for their abilities and achievements. As regular human beings. Women have endured this behavior, which for too long has been ignored and tolerated.
We are, all of us, speaking out, naming names and demanding that the harassers take responsibility for their behavior. I am proud of each of the women who has come forward, and heartened by the changing climate that has received their stories with acceptance and compassion.
TIME Magazine, by naming ‘The Silence Breakers’ as their ‘People of the Year,’ is recognizing what women have always known: there are men among us who use their positions of power and influence to manipulate, harass, and assault women. What is new here is the women.
Today, I am calling on my colleague Al Franken to step aside. I’ve struggled with this decision because he’s been a good Senator and I consider him a friend. But that cannot excuse his behavior and his mistreatment of women. (thread)

Will we be just?  Will we be fair?  Will America be a land of exclusivity for the few – or the land of opportunity for the many? #SCOTUS

Never ever be deterred by someone like @realdonaldtrump who doesn’t realize American ideals are bigger than any one man, any one President
To all of you who have spoken out- never, ever be deterred by those whose smallness incites them to label you "Sad!"
The patience to understand change rarely comes quickly, yet with the urgency to never stop standing up, never stop speaking out
All an activist needs is an undying, unrelenting passion for America, faith in our shared ideals and what I call "patient urgency"
But you do not need to go to law school or serve in the Senate to be an activist.
Today, I am a US Senator. An activist passionate as ever about America &amp; the ideals @realDonaldTrump does not understand
We decided the best way to make change was to have a voice at the table. I went to law school &amp; got involved in @YoungDemsHI
Protesting the Vietnam War ignited my activism. Nixon's policies were wrong. But it wasn't enough to protest.

What’s disappointing is counterproductive and politically-driven legislation when we should be working for #balanced #sequestration deal.

#Hawaii knows that key to #sustainable economy is renewable energy, respecting environment, and managing natural resources responsibly.

A strong economic foundation depends on a world class American #education system that prepares our country to compete in the STEM fields.
As an immigrant, I know the promise America offers and the hopes of those who come to our shores seeking a better life.
we don’t need to do it at the expense of the Diversity Visa Program.
While I believe we should be looking for ways to encourage the best and brightest to come to our shores and create American jobs...
Democrats and Republicans agree that we should establish a STEM visa program, but unfortunately Republicans inserted a poison pill.
Diversity visas provide a legal path for people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.
It follows the pattern of the Republicans’ approach of giving with one hand while taking with the other.
Unfortunately, the #STEMjobsAct isn’t the change we need.
in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields become victims of a broken visa system.
and the success of American businesses large and small. However, many foreign students who graduate from our best universities
The ability our nation to attract the world’s best and brightest has contributed greatly to the creation of American jobs...
