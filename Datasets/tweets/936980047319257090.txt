We need to de-criminalize narcotics. People can't kill each other with drugs, yet they remain a public health threat. Guns, on the other hand, are just fine and only pose a threat bc of the person using it. Same can be said for drugs. We know govt has good acid- time to share!
@NRA Guns and heroin seem to be having the same effect on society. Not all heroin users are "junkies", and not all gun owners are psychopaths. Both work to destroy communities why abused. Freedom to purchase guns and heroin freely = basic human  right?

Is it just me, or is the word “artisan” unbearably pretentious?
Watching The Devil Wears Prada, and want to know what was in that punch Andy is told not to drink. Sounds like good stuff.
@Deborahwestgat2 @VP Can't blame our infrastructure mess on Obama, when it takes many years to degrade. I'm also not blaming Trump for the current state of infrastructure. Waiting for him to make good on a campaign promise.
@nomadjames that image is not a meme, it's a piece of art. gotta go, the 700 club is on and pat robertson's guest is "tingling with excitement"

@VP @POTUS What about the people being sold into slavery in Libya?
@PressSec WHO CARES?! I want to know what the White House has to say about slave auctions in Libya? Tell us what America the Great is doing about serious problems? Or must we constantly be subjected to infantile finger pointing from the White House?
