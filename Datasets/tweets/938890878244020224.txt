@JackPosobiec https://t.co/R5pTpMvNCO

@RealSaavedra There are lots of Trump supporters in Chicago, despite the mayor suggesting they are a "Trump Free Zone!!!". But just because there was a racially charged hate crime, doesn't mean that it was some MAGA man. Not surprising that the left acts like they know exactly who it is.
It is easy to suggest that any hate crime against people of color was by some "MAGA loving white Trumpboy". People who make these claims create a bad perception about all Trump supporters. My thoughts and prayers are with Jussie Smollett. Wishing a speedy recovery for him!

@w_terrence It's just another double standard from democrats.
Democrats bring in hate groups (KKK, Antifa, BLM, Islam) and then blame it on Republicans as if they brought these terrorist organizations in. Radical Dimms do this for the sole purpose of gaining power, and then to do nothing to help minorities and blame that on Republicans.
@jamie_nix @dcexaminer So if Kavanaugh has been accused, he is guilty but a Muslim like Ellison is accused, he's innocent? I see an obvious double standard here.

@KashJackson2018 you should run for governor again in 2022, but you should do it as a Republican. Four years of Pritzker is going to suck, so its up to Republicans to win back voters. Unlike Rauner, you a true conservative, something that would go well with Illinois voters.

As much as I advocate for a red wave, there is one democrat that I believe should win. @RepLipinski is the only democrat that I support, and I only support him because his opponent is a neo-nazi that has 0 support from fellow republicans.

@MnM_012 @KashJackson2018 Well said! Four years of failure with Rauner is enough, and four years of Pritzker is just totally not worth it. Kash is the only candidate out of the four that is not corrupt. He's by far the youngest and he has a bright political career ahead of him!

@Gobbles78 @TomPelissero You should know better. You should know that this team was only going to win 5-6 with Mack anyways, so the trade basically seemed pointless and moronic. We just gave the Raiders 2 top 5 picks in 2019 and 2020 for practically nothing!

@theMMQB @AlbertBreer We should NOT have traded for Mack! We're gonna lose top 5 picks in 2019 and 2020! Mack will play on a team that is nowhere close to being a contender anytime soon, so he must be wondering why he wanted to come to Chicago. We do not deserve him. He should have been a Packer.
@MAYHEM_Bandit @SInow @AlbertBreer Bears got totally fleeced in the trade. Khalil Mack can have 25 sacks this year, and the Bears will still have the worst record in the NFC. That means the Bears gave the Raiders 2 top 5 picks in 2019 and 20. The Bears will not be competitive any time soon!

@TheJeffSchlegel He won't be the WR1 or WR2 to start the season. Kevin White has already been slated to start, and there is no chance Miller starts until White inevitably tears both acls and shatters his shoulder blade simultaneously. Even in that case, I think they'd choose Bellamy over Miller.

@TheBearsWire  https://t.co/XFhzD9enwS
@AaronLemingNFL I personally think that we had one of the most overrated offseasons this year. I believe Robinson will be on IR, Burton and Gabriel will be non-factors. I'm too concerned about Roquan and the defense. We'll have too many injuries again, and we'll be 3-13 but I hope I'm wrong.
@AaronLemingNFL I'm sorry Aaron, but I think you're working yourself up over nothing. A lot of the guys they'll play tomorrow won't make the team. Plus we are only going to win 3 or 4 games this year. I wouldn't realistically get this hyped until 2020, which is when the playoff window opens.

NBA ALERT: After signing Lebron, the Lakers are reportedly finalizing a trade with the Spurs that would send Lonzo, Kuzma and future picks to SA in exchange for Kawhi Leonard. Will have more details later.
BREAKING NEWS: LeBron is officially heading to LA. Deal is reportedly for 4 years/$154 mil.
@NickFriedell The Bulls won't match any offers that are more than $60 MIL because the Bulls are cheap and LaVine is not even worth $10 MIL in my opinion!
@ZachLaVine @NickFriedell Come on bro, you should know deep down inside that you are not worth that big of an investment!
@Blackhawk_Up In fact, Toews and Kane will both be gone after the season! Trading Toews and Kane is the ONLY way in hell to be able to terminate the bad contracts of Seabrook and Keith. The long-term rebuild is pretty much underway!
@MitchellWinkelm Honestly, all three guys never had a prime, so it appears the Hawks will settle for status quo. Depending on how they start, they will eventually either go all-in on trying to win the cup or they will tank and begin a 5-10 year rebuild.

@davidhogg111 @realDonaldTrump @NRA Very disrespectful to attack the president like that! If you really want change so badly, then why don't you actually make change instead of going off like this?
@realDonaldTrump John Cox is unqualified and does not give a damn about Californians! Travis Allen gets my vote! A true republican candidate California needs! He is prepared to stop crime, crazy taxes, poverty and much more! Vote for Allen on June 5th and he'll truly make California Great Again!

@king3JBM @UCF_Football it's how the national champion wanna-be's celebrate
@DJSeanHaley I can pretty much guarantee you that more than half of their picks will be from very small schools.
@AllProNation @jacobinfante24 @BearsPodcast As much as I don't want Edmunds at 8, multiple sources have said that the #Bears have told Edmunds that they will draft him at 8. It's a done deal. I think passing up on Smith will haunt them.
@AllProNation @jacobinfante24 @BearsPodcast He might have a high ceiling, but he also has perhaps the lowest floor of any prospect in this draft. Plus he's not quite the leader Roquan Smith is. Smith is a leader on and off the field, which should be a trait the Bears covet. Much safer pick than Edmunds.
@AllProNation @jacobinfante24 @BearsPodcast Why is everyone so high on Edmunds?
@ucf_problems @AlabamaFTBL The real national champs vs national champ wanna-be. Advantage goes to the real national champs! #WeWillCrushUCF #RollTide
@TheJeffSchlegel Are the Bears even going to draft a WR at all?
@TheJeffSchlegel @sammiebee20 Shouldn't they teach these guys to not be racist before they even get the job?
@ChicagoBears @SIRIUSXM I'm sorry, but the Bears will be no better than 4-12 this year. This team will have to have historically good drafts for each of the next 3-4 years if they even want to be close to being .500 at any point in the next 3-4 seasons. #facts #ItsTheTruth #justsayin
@ChicagoBears @SIRIUSXM It's time for me to shut down the delusional Bears fans! Bears fans need to pay close attention to what I'm gonna say. The Bears are almost certainly going to have one of the worst offenses in the league and the defense will regress badly. This team doesn't have a bright future!
@TurboNeoGeo @thekapman @ESPN1000 @ChicagoBears Agreed! Our offense is going to be one of the worst in the NFL, and our defense will regress mightily.

@modeloman14 People who do should be banned from twitter!
@mhill_22 @ChicagoBearPaws he can catch, but he can't step foot on soldier field without a bone shattering into 5000 pieces.
@ChicagoBearPaws First of all, White will be on IR during training camp, and second of all John Fox needs to keep his dry-ass mouth shut! He knows nothing about football, and is just annoying as hell!
@DavidHaugh Nagy coaches to win, and will inspire his players to hit harder, run faster, and just do everything execution-wise better than the opponent, something that John Fox did not bring to the table.
@ChicagoSports @ChiTribKane Martez Carter
@GavinoBorquez Exactly why they're reuniting in Chicago (Parker and Cohen)
@DrunkTrubisky @Mtrubisky10 Go home, you're drunk.
@thetroopsNFL @ChicagoBears Delete your account 😂😂😂
@ChicagoBears **SPOILER ALERT** The #Bears are opening their 2018 season against the #Rams at Soldier Field. Game will televised at 1:00 (Eastern Time) on FOX. Announcers are Kevin Burkhardt and Charles Davis.
@black_42 @DaBearsk35 @martinez3507 Considering I know more football than you, I can pretty much tell you exactly what they are going to do in this draft! 😂😂
@DaBearsk35 @black_42 @martinez3507 They are actually going to trade up to 5 and take their only target which is Nelson.
@ChiBearsHistory wheres the touchdown pass?
@TimmeToThe @cfrelund @nflnetwork prove it
@TimmeToThe @cfrelund @nflnetwork Come on Bears fan! Get some brain matter in your head! I'm also a Bears fan, but I know that this team is nowhere close to being a playoff team. I'm prepared to take some criticism for it, but I feel confident that I will be the one telling everyone "I told you so!"
@TimmeToThe @cfrelund @nflnetwork What the fuck do you know about football?
@DenotsM @ChicagoBears A live look-in at Kevin White at the half way point of the season... https://t.co/yfVQScPbJM
@ChicagoToLondon @ChicagoBears  https://t.co/SndLTtPh8L
@cfrelund @nflnetwork The Jets Bears and Browns don't even belong on this list. Texans have best shot imo
@QuinnsterX @Bear_Down_4Life @fthemilenials @MySportsUpdate @ChicagoBears nah that was your defense lmfao
@SenorMysterious Fuck the 49ers
@JoshRob_dynasty Too high for McGlinchey, and Hurst
@BearsFGSN Personally, I think it would be best to just tank and get the highest pick we can in the 2019 draft. Real Bears fans like me should know that this is not a playoff team, and still at least 3-4 years away from being a contender! #justsaying #facts
@BearsFGSN I highly dought it. Too much talent in that division, and the fact that the Bears have no future pro bowlers on the roster, yeah playoffs is a no go.
@JoshRob_dynasty Terrible mock

@OliverMcGee Trump needs to stop rejecting God!
@JayTeeTheOG When you're the natl champs, you can do whatever the fuck you want! It would have been foolish for them to pass up a potentially once in a lifetime opportunity.
@kencraig999 @Ezra__Brooks @IngrahamAngle @AlabamaFTBL @realDonaldTrump Who are our bitches who have only 1 natty 🤔😕😎

@VicLombardi He won't be a free agent for long. From what I'm hearing, the #Dolphins are expected to sign him in the next few days. The fit is just way too obvious.

I feel confident that @bakermayfield will be a great QB, and the best in the 2018 class! Teams that pass up on him will someday face the consequences! #DraftBakerMayfield #CantMissQB #NFLDraft2018
@Grindin_59 @Beanzz16 @ChicagoBears I think this is a good signing for the short term. Bennie is for sure an above average 4th/5th receiver.
@Grindin_59 @DezBryant Can you follow me plzzzz?
@TheJeffSchlegel What are your thoughts on the Dez-to-Chicago rumors?
@Grindin_59 @DezBryant Seriously Danny, what the fuck is wrong with you? https://t.co/E4Xjb1lFIY
@Osric26 @Grindin_59 @DezBryant Uuhhhhh... no we don't actually
@JDTiberi  https://t.co/mPoRkKnrTh
@chasehughes__97 Why? He's washed up and well past his prime! He wants to join a playoff team!
@Shaquemgriffin Can't wait to see you in navy and orange! #BearsNation #BearsGang #BearDown https://t.co/67Y8nvXFZ6
@chasehughes__97 😂😂🤣🤣 https://t.co/wtZwD1i52z
@WCGridiron Definitely no need to worry, cuz we just signed Bennie Fowler!
@swagfly92 he's not really a replacement. He's more of a depth guy. Meredith should be replaced by 1-2 WRs the #Bears draft.
@iLLiPin0 @AdamSchefter I'd be shocked if they didn't
@charlespattersn @CHIBears247 Ridley's WAY faster than Sutton. #facts #ThatsNotAnOpinion
@IanRapereport  https://t.co/LfaZyu3GTL
@TRUTHbisky @DezBryant @ChicagoBears  https://t.co/vyqMGS9lkX
@TheMustardTig3r @TRUTHbisky @DezBryant @ChicagoBears Stay off the weed
@ErikLambert1 IMO, I think the Bears are kind of the Rams from 1-2 years ago today. After the Rams had their breakout season, they were able to bring in some big personalities (similar to Dez). The Bears can bring in big personalities when they start winning, which is why signing Dez is a nogo
@ErikLambert1 Don't worry about it Erik! Dez is going to join a team that has had success recently (probably signs with Rams)
@theotherdeefish Not really worth signing a guy who is well past his prime. It would make more sense if the Bears were already contending, but they are not contenders for at least another 3 years.
@charlespattersn @CHIBears247 Sutton's trash. I'd rather go with a guy like Ridley, Gallup, Moore or Kirk.
@MrT I pity the fool who argues with Mr T!
@Ckwal1126 Fuck you too. Your goddamn team aint shit! We got more talent than you. We better than you! We gonna crush your asses! 😂😂🤣🤣

@DaWindyCityFS lol
@DBZDoll Stay off the weed mothafucka! 😂😂
@ZackZerndt @AaronLemingNFL I'd take neither. I'd rather just draft a guy late first/early second round (DJ Moore, Michael Gallup, Christian Kirk etc.)
@Bears__Nation Hell mothafucking no 😂
@DeriWells @NFLUK @49ers Fuck the 49ers 😂💪🔥
@BearsNationCHI 4 years ago, I would break the bank for him. Today, he is simply way past is prime, no I wouldn't sign him.
@Covers Rams
@JacobSamp17 Hell no
@TheJeffSchlegel @dallascowboys I'm thinking Rams
@Ckwal1126 Nah we drafting Roquan all day! 😂😂😂 #RoquanToChicago #BearDown #NinersStillSuck
@ChicagoBears Roquan Smith
HAPPY FUCKING #FridayThe13th!
I'm so fucking tired
@ChicagoBears I pity the fool who is not obsessed!
@BullsNationBR_ Mas John Paxson é um pomo, então ele provavelmente vai foder essa reconstrução de qualquer maneira!
@RapSheet I hope this man can get some help! Would hate to see him behind bars for 11 years!
#FreeMeekMillNow
@NotGarForman Fuck you too!
@Nephew_Joey @BullsSource Nope. Bridges is their top prospect, and quite possibly the only guy they are really gonna take a close look at.
@BullsSource I can tell you Michael Porter is for damn sure off their board, and they also said that they really think Bridges is the best player in this draft! Gar/Pax don't give a shit about their fans or the organization! #WhatAFuckingJoke #FireGarPax
@BullsNationBR_ Com John Paxson no comando, estou preocupado que esta reconstrução seja um fracasso total
@BullsNationBR_ Me incomoda tanto que esse filho da puta ainda tem um emprego!
