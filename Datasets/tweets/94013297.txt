As Public Advocate, I will make sure we finish the job and close Rikers. We must continue to drive criminal justice reforms to make our city more fair and just. And we must make sure that everyone is treated fairly under the law.
That’s why as Speaker I decriminalized low level offenses, created a bail fund, kicked ICE off #Rikers &amp; led the fight to close Rikers for good. This facility, far from prying eyes, fed a culture of violence. It was and is a blight on our city.

The attack on #JussieSmollett is nothing new to folks who are #LGBTQ and black and experience hate &amp; violence daily. It is our duty as a society to end violence against all queer people, especially queer people of color, and increase resources to support them.
We are also here to remember the at least 26 trans people who were murdered last year in the U.S. We are here for Dana Martin, a Black trans woman murdered in in Alabama last month &amp; for Candice Elease Pinky, a Black trans woman shot last week in Houston.

@GloriaPazmino How lovely. The clown decided to set up his circus on the steps of city hall.
there should be absolutely no hints or suggestions about their identities. We’ve seen this pattern all too often — women are outed as survivors without their consent, shamed, and targeted. It’s why so many choose not to report. New York City, let’s be better than this.
As this city reckons with a new report of sexual harassment, let’s please respect those who come forward as survivors, and those who choose not to. I strongly believe survivors should not be identified without their consent —

The most progressive city in the nation cannot have such a crushing racial and gender imbalance. We deserve more. We deserve representation. We deserve to lead. #electwomen @AmplifyHerNYC
But as Congress and our state move forward, our city is slipping backwards. We don’t have ANY women, or people of color, currently serving in citywide office. Only 11 out of 51 council members are women.
In NY, we are also welcoming a record number of women to the State Legislator. We have the first African American woman as majority leader, @AndreaSCousins. We have a woman as chair the Finance committee, @LizKrueger.
Congratulations to the record 102 women in Congress! Representation matters: you have to see it to be it.

This is no way to run a transit system that 5.5 million New Yorkers rely on daily.
Subway riders are sick of being lied to &amp; jerked around. After two years of being told one story, New Yorkers deserve to know what systematic failures led to a shutdown being deemed necessary before all options were explored.
Um, what? Of course everyone wants the subway fixed quickly &amp; running smoothly, but the MTA and the Governor owe New Yorkers the truth about why this new plan came so late in the game. Families moved neighborhoods, businesses suffered, &amp; suddenly the Governor says—just kidding?
We only have ONE WEEK left until our most important fundraising deadline. Will you join me in making NYC a fairer and more just city for all? With public matching funds, your contribution could be worth 6x!Donate &gt;&gt;&gt; https://t.co/W1itLsYDEB 	#VoteMelissa

Marijuana has essentially been legal for white New Yorkers for years — while young men and women of color are unfairly arrested and ensnared in the criminal justice system. Let’s get it legalized, throw out old convictions + invest in communities and in our city
4 years after I called for marijuana legalization, I’m glad @NYCMayor is finally getting on board. Just like his initial opposition to closing Rikers or funding lawyers for undocumented immigrants, legalization is a common-sense move that the Mayor should have supported years ago

#Weed4Rails no es un reemplazo para la fijación de precios de congestión, pero neoyorquinos merecen una solución YA! La marihuana puede ser una maneras más rápida de acceder a los ingresos si existe la voluntad política. Es hora de que legalicemos la marihuana y reparemos @MTA.

#Weed4Rails is not a replacement for congestion pricing, but New Yorkers deserve a solution to the transit crisis NOW. Marijuana can be one of the fastest ways to access revenue if the political will is there. It’s high time we legalized marijuana — and fixed the broken MTA.

我们的声音是我们的力量。 无论当权的人多少遍想埋没我们的声音，我们必须努力奋斗争取一个更加正义，更加平等，更加公平的纽约市。
Nuestras voces son nuestra fuerza. No importa cuántas veces los que están en el poder intenten silenciarnos, DEBEMOS seguir hablando y exigiendo una ciudad más justa, y más equitativa.
Our voices are our strength. No matter how many times those in power try to silence us, we MUST keep speaking up and demanding a more just, more equitable, more fair city. https://t.co/meESrVv99t
We now have 3 white men occupying all citywide positions of leadership. In a city as diverse, as progressive, and as fierce as New York—this cannot stand. https://t.co/UQ8FHizqng
There is a leadership vacuum in this city. Our elected officials are churning out tired excuses and defending the bureaucracy—instead of fighting for us.
I will speak up for New Yorkers who are sick and tired of the city giving billions in tax breaks to @amazon. They deserve tax breaks about as much as Donald Trump deserves a medal of honor. #HQ2
Como su Defensora del Pueblo, hablaré por los millones de usuarios del subway que están siendo ignorados * que se le está mintiendo. Es hora de que los funcionarios electos asuman la responsabilidad, cesen las disputas * y arreglen el subway descompuesto.
As your Public Advocate, I will speak up for the nearly half a million NYCHA residents whose houses are falling apart, and for the millions of renters who are being pushed out of their neighborhoods. https://t.co/zLawsGr9G4
As your Public Advocate, I’ll speak up for the millions of subway riders who are being ignored &amp; lied to. It’s time for elected officials to take responsibility, end the bickering &amp; fix the broken subway. https://t.co/ovweVxfy3C
Long before Trump arrived, when Obama refused to help undocumented immigrants stay in our country, I called him out for tearing families apart—and then led the fight to ban ICE from Rikers.
Cuando los inmigrantes indocumentados de nuestra ciudad enfrentaban la deportación, exigí abogados para todos los inmigrantes detenidos. Los reaccionarios dijeron cómo nos ATREVIAMOS a financiar esto, pero lo hicimos realidad.
When our city’s undocumented immigrants were facing deportation, I demanded lawyers for all detained immigrants. The reactionaries said, how DARE we fund this—but we made it happen. https://t.co/nTZT78aEfn
When black &amp; brown New Yorkers were being charged as criminals for staying in a park after dark, I said we must decriminalize low-level offenses. Commissioner Bratton said it was too dangerous—but we got it done.
I was the first citywide official to call for closing Rikers Island—and Mayor de Blasio said it was a “noble idea.” But we brought community activists and elected officials to the table—and now Rikers is closing for good. https://t.co/roqnXql30z
When women are told to be quiet, it’s meant to silence us. Because when we speak the truth, loudly, aggressively, we can change the world. https://t.co/HTEcyVGPaW
I’ve been told I’m too loud, too aggressive. What they mean is that as a woman, I should be calm. Should be tame. Should apologize for who I am.
Nuestros funcionarios electos siguen diciéndonos que el subway está mejorando. Siguen diciendo que las reparaciones de NYCHA se están acelerando. Pero no vemos los cambios. ¿Estamos locos o están mintiendo?
Our elected officials keep telling us the subway is getting better. They keep saying NYCHA repairs are speeding up. But we don’t see the changes. Are we crazy—or are they lying?

@Pwr4PuertoRico's position is that none of the federal funds allocated to address the devastation caused by #HurricaneMaria can go to paying the debt AND that designation of funds must have authentic community input/planning. We cannot allow #DisasterCapitalism to take hold.
And many of the proposals presented (during the rushed &amp; inadequate public comment period) would displace “historically vulnerable communities who have been unable to access any information around CDBG-DR processes or the projected plans”
"@HUDgov has set aside $20B in Community Development Block Grants–Disaster Recovery (CDBG–DR) funds to help the island recover. On July 30, HUD approved an action plan that will determine how the island will spent the first $1.5 billion in CDBG–DR funds it received."
“These are the funds that are going to determine how Puerto Rico is going to look like in the next 20 yrs,” Ariadna Godreau-Aubert Ayuda, Ayuda Legal Huracán María.		Advocates say vulnerable Puerto Ricans left out of $1.5B recovery planning process https://t.co/O4qF1zDvYJ

"Many clandestine procedures are carried out with limited medical oversight. Complications from these abortions are the leading cause of maternal deaths in the country, researchers say,accounting for 18 percent of all maternal deaths in Argentina."
"But that doesn’t mean women in Argentina are not having abortions. No official numbers are available, but Health Minister Adolfo Rubinstein has estimated there are more than 350k clandestine abortions every year. Human rights groups put the number higher, around 500,000 a year."
"Under current Argentine law, in place since 1921, abortion is legal only in cases of rape or if the pregnancy poses a risk to the woman’s health."
