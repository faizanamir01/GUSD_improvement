8,169 minutes in forced Portland VA inpatient mix-gender	MST/PTSD crisis care (5C) with aggressive males felt like mental torture, not life saving treatment. I personally don’t want my crisis care to be an 	OHSU student elective and my doctor to be their teacher. #NotConsensual
Being forced into VA inpatient care against my will as a voluntary patient who was not a high suicide risk was worse than being held captive and sexually assaulted in the military in many ways. It took me 4 hours to escape from my military attacker. Dr Cornejo held me 136. #MST

@Enviro_Mental33 @LeoShane @vets4bernie At least two federal tort cases against them right now (that I know of) for how OHSU treats MST/PTSD veterans in crisis in their 5C inpatient unit.
@Enviro_Mental33 @LeoShane @vets4bernie I’m glad you got good care ♥️
@Enviro_Mental33 @LeoShane @vets4bernie They are great, they are just not great for VA veteran MST/PTSD crisis care. They don’t follow our VA policy. Their forced treatment was illegal and so non-trauma informed and terrifying I wanted to kill myself. I was a voluntary patient, not high Suicide risk.
@suebell49 Thank you for all you do!!
