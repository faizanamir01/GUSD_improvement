@HighheelsDes @Jiorworld @MichaelAvenatti What doesn't make sense to me about the campaign violations story is President Trump isn't exactly tight for cash, if Cohen used campaign funds with the assumption that Trump would put it back from the Trump organization, it becomes a wash🤔also Obama did the same thing.

@RoPosFlo @HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti Stormy is the  new Mary Magdelene🙄
@HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti Lying about what?
@RoPosFlo @HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti Thank God!
@teelorr1954 @MichaelAvenatti @StormyDaniels Why are you protecting a sex soliciting professional?
@RoPosFlo @HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti Trump is not giving any attention to this bad actor called Stormy...I'm sure there are plenty of gold diggers out there he is also ignoring.
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti Just don't be so inclined to judge.
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti Stormy, is a fraud!
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti Why do you believe her story? You saw a pic of the both of them at a celebration?
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti Equal to her! But he denies it! I believe him!
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti Her word against his, my experience.I have had several girlfriends that call the police and say they have been abused and no abuse occurred, yet these innocent men go to jail!
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti She makes a living at enticing sexual attention! I do not believe for a moment that Trump would entertain this trashy tramp, but he could unwittingly take a photo with her and she uses it for monetary gains😂
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti She publicly declares "I'm a whore"  through her actions and feels she can take down the President of the United States! She is a declared and self admitted whore! Challenging the Winner of the Free World!🤷‍♀️
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti I'm not buying the narrative.
@RoPosFlo @HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti So why does Trump carry the morality load if Stormy agreed?
@teelorr1954 Ok...
@RoPosFlo @HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti You are assuming I believe the tramp named Stormy Daniels,  bought and paid for as per her agenda🤔
@HighheelsDes @SusanMartin2244 @MichaelAvenatti Is it criminal to f•ck? Not that I think for a moment that President Trump would do a whore, but really if that's the worst thing he's done...he has my endorsement.
@MelliRolli @HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti She's honest? On what level? If she allegedly signed a contractual agreement to be paid to stay silent, and became a fog horn for his atrocities that she co created with him. How is she superior morally?
@HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti If Stormy was moral at that time she could  have responded " Hey Donald, I know when a women is in her 3rd trimester, she's not going to want your dick in there too, so do the right thing, Go Home, my friend.
@RobG91065424 @maiuckhaemlple Not having all the information is the difference.

@HighheelsDes @MichaelAvenatti I don't respect women that make a living between a man's legs. We are much greater than that, and to misuse our energy like that debase's the intimacy between adults with love and equality. She has no respect for herself therefore she has no respect for any man.

@PatriotFries @otto_rohwedder @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Everything is outrageously prices here, very expensive to live here. We don't have a negotiater as a Leader, we have sensitive gender fluid personkind type of person.
@lacccaa @Rolling_Podium @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump Perhaps Trump may have negotiated a better deal, Obama did what he thought was in the best interest of all at that time.
Trump is confident he could have negotiated a better deal.

@26RJeremy @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump What is Uranium used for?
@lacccaa @Rolling_Podium @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump I know very little about the Iran deal, so I'm genuinely asking questions. You said "assets" not cash" but a large amount of cash was given?
@lacccaa @Rolling_Podium @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump What assets? Obama gave them a lot of cash, that can't be negated.
@lacccaa @Rolling_Podium @EdKrassen @misterbumface @realDonaldTrump With cash?

@liseski @SDDNOLE @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Dirty politics, text book trickery, to get people like you to feel the way you do, so easy to influence small minds...quit focusing on gossip. There is a coordinated scheme to take down Trump and not for anything Trump may have done personally or professionally.

@Ssmitty2929 @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Thank you!
RT @Ssmitty2929: @Kim4827 @katelovescolor @mitchellvii  https://t.co/O56WnOhxoK
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii This whole story is petty and desperate to find any morsel of wrongdoing, just like the Russian bullshit, you guys are clinging on to concocted fantasizes. Trump has no money issues, "prove intent" and does it not concern you if Hilliary's behavior's? Would you prefer that?
@katelovescolor @DubbleDave @mitchellvii Just because 19 women come forward with allegations, doesn't mean they have integrity and were not paid to convince you to hate Trump.
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii Unless you there buddy watching Stormy and Trump going at it...you don't know...
@DubbleDave @katelovescolor @mitchellvii They are alleged stories, no proof, no texts, no selfies, nothing...politics is dirty,  especially with Clintons in the arena. We are all sinners, I don't require Trump to be a Saint, I require him to restore what's been lost through Globalists agenda's.
@SDDNOLE @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Thank you!
@katelovescolor @SDDNOLE @mitchellvii How do you know she was not paid to lie by the opposition?
@katelovescolor @SDDNOLE @mitchellvii “If we had to defend this as not being a campaign contribution, I think we could do that. This was for personal reasons. The president had been hurt personally, not politically, personally so much and the first lady by the false allegations,” Giuliani said.
@MrsAJJones @ebizarch @PoliticsWhatery @bonniebailey63 @robreiner Just so you know, I don't watch any news stations, but if I had to, it certainly would be Fox, have you seen their ratings...way up there...
@MrsAJJones @ebizarch @PoliticsWhatery @bonniebailey63 @robreiner Read the newspapers? Yeah that's pure non fiction and unbiased🙄
@DubbleDave @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Evidence that pizza gate is real?
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii “If we had to defend this as not being a campaign contribution, I think we could do that. This was for personal reasons. The president had been hurt personally, not politically, personally so much and the first lady by the false allegations,” Giuliani said.	#falseallegations.
@katelovescolor @SDDNOLE @mitchellvii I personally know several women who have told bold faced lies about their men in court, men have spent time is jail for a false narrative. She is of a low moral fiber and I can not give any credibility to this it is beneath me to do so. The media knows people will eat this up.
@DubbleDave @katelovescolor @mitchellvii Trump could be that man now, but the media won't let you entertain that thought.
@katelovescolor @mitchellvii Do you realize that having consensual sex with an adult is not illegal or unheard of...I would bet that the opposition paid her to spread this rumor, and then paid again from Cohen to stop spreading the lie...she could of been paid twice? After all this is war!
