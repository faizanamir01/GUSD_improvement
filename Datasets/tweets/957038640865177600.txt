@BBSpyGuy So the reason the movie sucked (supposedly) is bc they tried to squeeze all 7 fat ass books into ONE FILM. They didn’t even bring up my favorite characters AT ALL.
Gilmore girls had mentioned Gerte, the German immigrant, Marlene Dietrich, AND Mr Bostick!! #CRUMBSCROSSOVER @BBSpyGuy
@BBSpyGuy WHHHHHAT?! I still haven’t seen the movie (I heard it was painfully bad) have you seen it?
