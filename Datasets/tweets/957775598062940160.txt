@LehrR @MsMollyRachael @DearAuntCrabby Bernie has some good points, but I have serious reservations about his judgement &amp; am not inclined to vote for him.		I’m supporting Kamala Harris, but will keep an open mind about other candidates.
@LehrR @MsMollyRachael @DearAuntCrabby Human beings are complex. To judge their character, their suitability &amp; chances as candidates requires that we perform our due diligence.		Using dismissive labels to sweep away a group of candidates as unworthy of consideration is disrespectful of both candidates &amp; voters.
@LevyPants07 @MsMollyRachael @DearAuntCrabby No, Kamala is very real.		I did my research on her when she ran for Cali AG &amp; have followed her career ever since. I support her for POTUS; she has both ability &amp; character, but as a strong challenger to DJT (&amp; as a female &amp; POC) she’s being targeted by mudslinging troll armies.

@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein Wow. I wonder if we really watched the same video.		I saw it very differently.		🌊🇺🇸🕊
@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein Some people have tweeted that the long video was “no better” than the short one, and frankly I’m baffled by that.		I thought DiFi handled the situation with patience &amp; caring, but she stood her ground &amp; didn’t cave in to thoughtless (but well-meaning) immaturity.
@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein When the Sunrise folks posted that video with a negative framing in the tweet, they were disrespecting you, maybe not on purpose, but it is always disrespectful to manipulate people.		They could have said, “We’re concerned by this. What do you think?”
@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein A life lesson for whoever might be interested:		Always beware when people tell you what you should think.		If you see, “Look at this horrible thing, (X)!”		Before you even look at (X), be -mindful- that someone was trying to bias your view before you could form your own opinion.
@RobCoffin @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein She didn’t just point her in the right direction. She told the aids to give her the internship-granting the request.		As for your characterization &amp; conclusions, all I can say is that I saw it differently than you.
@jalfd Criticizing DiFi for not doing the impossible only strengthens the very people who are preventing progress.		Dianne Feinstein is our ally. 		Let’s put our efforts into clearing away the real obstacles.		🌊🇺🇸🕊
@jalfd That’s not in dispute. DiFi has grandchildren she cares deeply about!		Reality? •We voters• let the GOP rule the Senate &amp; WH. 		DiFi is in the Dem minority in the Senate. She’s using her energy &amp; political capital to do what is possible under GOP rule.
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein When one of the visitors said ‘we voted for you’ and Dianne Feinstein stopped her, questioning whether that was true as she seemed too young, she was keeping the discourse on track. 		She gave the visitors honesty &amp; expected the same in return.		That’s not disrespect.		🕊
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Dianne Feinstein survives in that world •because• she calls out such behavior. That in itself was a lesson for the visitors. 	This is the sort of exactitude our lawmakers must have, both to craft the laws we live by &amp; to deal with those who try to move us only by force of will.
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Your objection to the voting comment missed out on something, IMHO.		In a partisan world, sloppy definitions &amp; muzzy reasoning are often used to bamboozle listeners. To survive in that environment, one must be scrupulously exact in discourse.
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein She did try to talk to them, but they didn’t absorb or process what she was saying.	When they kept insisting she support the GND, even after she’d explained why it wasn’t possible, I thought she was amazingly patient.
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein Having watched the long one, I find myself baffled at how negatively people have characterized DiFi’s words &amp; demeanor.	In some cases, there are obvious trolls pushing their divisive agenda.	In others, perhaps well-meaning folks watched the short clip 1st &amp; it colored their view?
@acmecatalyst @GhertrudeTara @e2theitheta @samirose817 @VarshPrakash @sunrisemvmt @SenFeinstein When I first became aware of the Sunrise video, &amp; found out there was a “long version,” I purposefully went straight to the long version.

She’s the real deal-a public servant who is motivated first &amp; foremost by the public good.		She’s earned my respect, &amp; my vote.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick I reject your ad hominem attack on her.		If you are genuinely trying to help the cause, then I feel sorry for your inability to recognize &amp; value an ally.		If you are a troll simply trying to stir up discontent &amp; division, then you’re doing an excellent job.		Proud of yourself?🕊
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick She tried to explain to them, but they weren’t processing what she was saying &amp; kept repeating their unrealistic demands.		There were people with appointments waiting to see her.		DiFi was as gracious as she •could• be, but she held her ground &amp; wouldn’t lie to them.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Did you watch the entire 6-part video?		She was extremely patient with people who were being unreasonable &amp; demanding. I saw no condescension at all.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Feinstein •wasn’t• dishing out any BS.	She tried to tell them the GND wouldn’t fly. She asked them to read her bill &amp; asked them for feedback.		She tried to bring them into the process. They had set themselves up with an unworkable goal &amp; were disappointed-&amp; quite unfair to DF.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick I can understand the young children not knowing any better, but the older ones &amp; adults could have/should have thought this through. They set themselves up for disappointment, &amp; unlike DJT, DiFi doesn’t pander to her constituents. She’s •honest• &amp; that’s a good thing.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick I’ve watched the entire 6-part video. She was extremely patient. She acknowledged &amp; valued their passion, but stood her ground on the facts. She tried to explain, but they didn’t process what she was saying &amp; kept repeating their talking points. Their demands were unrealistic.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Well, we see things differently, then.		I see nothing to gain in attacking people who are on your own side.		We get things done by working together, supporting each other.		🌊🇺🇸🗽🕊
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Sabotage? SMH.		Putin wants us destroying each other. His minions are doing everything they can to prod us into conflict.		We can’t win by giving our enemy exactly what he wants. We have to fix what’s wrong, do right, get back on track, unite against our real foes, and heal.	🇺🇸🕊
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick But if we want to move something more before then, Dianne Feinstein is not the one obstructing progress. The GOP are the primary obstruction, along with fossil fuel influence money. Putting pressure on DiFi accomplishes nothing-give her an environment where she can do more.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Right now the GOP hold the Senate &amp; the White House. That’s the reality we have to face. Dianne Feinstein is in the Senate. The •ONLY• way she can move anything forward is with GOP votes. It’s that or •nothing• until January 2021, assuming we take the Sen &amp; WH in 2020.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick We get the government we deserve. For too long we were collectively apathetic, &amp; now we have to roll up our sleeves &amp; shoulder some responsibility. They’re trying to goad us into turning on each other. Don’t give ‘em the satisfaction. Choose your targets carefully &amp; let’s roll.🌊
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick So instead of making unjust accusations against public servants who are doing their best in a bad situation, why don’t we ask ourselves what we can do to help.	Help our candidates, put pressure on the opposition, &amp; expose the dark money forces exploiting the situation for gain.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Last thing-for those who complain about Dems who accept fossil fuel industry 💰, remember that they wouldn’t have to if we supported them. Our Dem candidates have to compete against GOP war chests. Many candidates have pledged not to accept oil 💰, but now aren’t raising enough.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick As long as the GOP keeps “Drill, baby, drill!” as their mantra, •and• they stay in power, Dems in the minority struggle to get anything done. Don’t blame DiFi for working out a deal that can pass in a GOP-held Senate. She’s working hard to move anything in the right direction.
@mikealbeland @SueBeeHun @PeterGleick Disagree. It’s up to us voters to ditch our collective apathy &amp; support candidates who’ll do something about climate change. Not enough of us supported Al Gore in 2000. Not enough Dems voted to keep a majority in Congress for Obama.

@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist I have to speak of all of this in the past tense tho’, because we’re getting a new system in 2020. Not sure the details, ‘cuz I’m a pollworker, but don’t work at the registrar’s office. They’ll be testing it in small local special elections if any are needed in 2019. We’ll see.🤞
@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist Both the regular &amp; audio ballots would be read by optical scanners back at the registrar’s office, so info wasn’t being transmitted electronically from the polling place to any central location. Nothing to hack there.
@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist When a voter was finished using the ABB, it would print out a ballot with the numbered bubbles filled out, according to the voter’s selections. The voter could compare the finished ballot to their sample ballot to verify, so hacking really wasn’t an issue.
@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist The audio ballot booth (ABB) allowed a voter to put on headphones &amp; listen to the entire ballot being read (in 10 languages in 2018) and they could punch buttons to select (or de-select), repeat, move forward or backward.
@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist For many years, Los Angeles County has had both regular paper ballots where you fill-in-the-numbered-bubble corresponding to your chosen candidate or ballot measure, &amp; also an audio ballot booth.

@sheehanmilesk @Irish_Atheist Vision-impaired voters can find it difficult to fill out paper ballots.	People with severe arthritis, or amputees can also have difficulty.	(And people with poor literacy skills like to use audio ballot machines to listen to the selections, instead.)
@Irish_Atheist Some current voting machines either produce a barcode which the voter can only assume reflects their choices, or others tally the votes electronically with no way to verify or recount.
@Irish_Atheist Yes, but the electronic voting machine can be made to produce a paper ballot that is readable by human eyes, as opposed to a barcode. In Los Angeles County, our audio ballot booths do exactly that. You mark the ballot by punching buttons &amp; it prints out a marked paper ballot.

@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch If such a thing ever did happen, at best they’d generate a big pile of provisionals that would all be rejected—but more than that, the info handwritten on all those provisional envelopes would be hard evidence to use in any fraud investigation. /6
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch I’ve heard all those nonsensical claims of busloads of “illegals” going from one polling place to another casting many votes. Utterly bogus propaganda.	/5
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch If the voter is properly registered, cast no other ballot, &amp; their signature matches previous signatures on record, the provisional envelope is opened &amp; the ballot is processed. If not, the envelope stays sealed, the ballot uncounted. /4
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch After the election, employees of the Registrar’s Office take each envelope, verify the voter is really a registered voter, verify that they didn’t already cast a ballot at another polling place nor send in a mail-in ballot, &amp; verify the signature on the envelope matches records/3
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch Each completed provisional ballot is sealed in an envelope where the voter filled out their info-name, addy, date &amp; place of birth, if naturalized citizen they put that info down, etc. They sign the envelope. (We don’t hand ‘em a ballot till they’ve filled out all the info.) /2
@thesixthwoman @ngarmy3HH144Inf @JudicialWatch Agree. I’m a pollworker in Los Angeles County. Anyone who shows up at a polling place is allowed to cast a ballot-a regular ballot if •on our voter roster•, or provisional if not. During 30-day post-election canvas, registrar checks provisionals. /1
@stormchaser4x4 @JudicialWatch I’ve been a pollworker in Los Angeles County for years. 	Your assertions are utter nonsense.
@FDG65 @JudicialWatch I live in Rep Waters’s district &amp; am a pollworker.

Our society has reached a point where access to such videos could reach a large percentage of the population. Isn’t it time we adapt our campaigns to make use of that technology?
Such vids could also serve to humanize our Democratic candidates in the eyes of GOP supporters who have been deluded into viewing Dems through a “demon-colored” lens.
The candidates can send the link out &amp; Americans across the country could observe •what• they have to say, the •reasons• they give for saying it, and how each of them treat one another.	A series of these vids would be more enlightening than some stilted debates.
I’d love to see our leading candidates sit down together to •discuss• the issues before us. Spend an hour or more having a kitchen table talk on topic x, post it on YouTube or wherever.
After these recent years of hyper-divisiveness, one of the characteristics we desperately need is the ability to be civil with our opponents, to engage them in substantive discussion, &amp; to heal our divided nation.
Yes, we need to understand the differences between the candidates to decide which one we prefer, but do we •really• have to go into snipe/attack mode to do that?
With both foreign &amp; domestic actors seeking to exploit divisions within our country &amp; within our party, I dread the inevitable tussle of the upcoming Democratic primary race.

@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens It is on subject because a lot of the online analysis/chatter about Minor swirled around his eligibility, as is the case with the page I linked to.🕊
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens Honest question:		Do you call Ted Cruz “Rafael”?
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens If he went by Bob or Bobby would you still insist on Robert?
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens I don’t like my given name either, so I use my middle name. If someone insisted on calling me by my first name to “just be truthful,” I’d think they were just using that as an excuse to be rude.🕊
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens Obama birthers tried to use Minor, too. They were unsuccessful. This spells it out nicely, though the comments are really something.	https://t.co/Rahrj9O5gs
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens So, leaving aside “Mr. President,” would you insist on calling Jimmy Carter “James Earl Carter”?		He had to sue to be listed on the ballot as Jimmy.		Beto is the name B grew up with, is comfortable with, &amp; so he prefers it. Of course, you do have the right to be disrespectful.🕊
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams To all my fellow human beings who are working to make the world a better place for all of us, I send you my love &amp; respect.		Together, one step at a time, we will build a better future.		💕🗽🌊🕊
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams In reasoned discourse, people show each other respect. They are willing to discuss the details &amp; subtleties of a topic with the goal of reaching some mutually accepted conclusion, or else an agreement to disagree.	Constant peppering of potshots to distract &amp; confuse isn’t worthy.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams The troll’s purpose is to create an environment so toxic that their chosen target will either get fed up &amp; leave social media, or at least will lapse into silence to escape further attack, either way ceding ground to the troll. 	It’s not about the topic, it’s about domination.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams All these insulting &amp; manipulative ploys mean, of course, is that the troll isn’t trying to change the mind of their target. (If you’re trying to convince someone to see things your way, bombarding them with contempt is a poor way to do it).
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams The trolling attack-attack-attack approach is, of course, a way both to dominate &amp; to direct discourse-keep discourse on the troll’s •chosen topics•, keep the target trying to earn the troll’s concurrence, which they’ll never give no matter who’s in the right.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Another trolling tactic is to assault with many topics/accusations/sneers, to maneuver the target into defending on many fronts, or else “lose the argument.” (Such word-assaults are not reasoned argument).
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Another trolling tactic is simple whataboutism- to name any topic, especially an emotionally charged one, phrase it as sneeringly as possible, &amp; drop it, not even bothering to frame an argument. Adding lots of references to excrement makes it even more vivid.
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens I’m not familiar with any Chinese prom dress, but I don’t really have to explain that Beto’s hometown of El Paso has a significant Spanish-speaking population &amp; a kid growing up there...		I get the feeling you’re just looking for excuses to jab at the left.		Enjoy your day.🕊
@StarnesDouglas @TreasonHappens It makes no difference. 🕊	https://t.co/1nHAqOqS0k
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams One trolling tactic is to select a true fact, but take it out of context. For example, stating California has the highest homeless population in the US, (sneer), while ignoring CA also has the highest population-period. Nearly 12% of US pop is in Cali.
@JohnYeasu @Lee_Runestad @KamalaHarris @staceyabrams You’ve forked this thread so badly, I hardly know where to post my response, but perhaps that was intentional?

@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell Another agent interrupted just then, and we never did get to ask what happened with they guy who killed his wife.  Been wondering about that ever since.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell So, the agent explained to us, it doesn't matter what crime they're investigating, or what they expect to find.  They come in with force, ready to deal with anything.  Normal practice, so he told us.	When you look at it that way, it makes sense.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell He grabbed a tool off his workbench &amp; grabbed a fellow employee from the next workstation and started screaming he'd kill the guy unless the agents backed off.  The agents had come for records, not expecting any trouble, &amp; suddenly were faced with a hostage situation.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell So there he was, working at his station, playing it cool, when suddenly he looks up to see a bunch of FBI agents walking in.  He jumped to the conclusion they had come there for him.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell They weren't expecting any trouble. To get to the office, they had to walk thru the machine shop, but what none of them knew was one of the mechanics there had murdered his wife the night before.  Her body was at home, &amp; he'd gone in to work the next day as if nothing was wrong.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell "Hey dude, what's with the guns? Did you think we were gonna get into a shoot-out over the timecards?"	The agent smiled, and told us a little story.  Some years previously, FBI agents were working a case of alleged fraudulent billing &amp; went to a company to seize records.
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell This is pretty intimidating.  We were stunned, eyes wide, and we complied.  After they'd secured the area, they put their guns away and we helped them find the timecards and labor records they wanted. After a while, one of my co-workers got up the nerve to ask one of the agents,
@David_J_Koch @RepSwalwell Years ago, I worked for a company that got raided by the FBI.  We had some gov't contracts, &amp; an employee who'd been fired -for cause- decided to get revenge by claiming misdeeds with labor charging.  (Nothing came of it). The FBI agents came in with guns drawn...

@sis_boom_baaah @politvidchannel Watergate &amp; Ford’s pardon of Nixon devastated the GOP’s reputation with the electorate. When they had to plot their path back to lasting power, creating the conditions for a compliant media (or propaganda outlets, if you prefer) was put high on their To Do list.
@sis_boom_baaah @politvidchannel I agree well enough with what you’re saying, but just want to be clear that the goddess Minerva (Rush, Fox, etc) didn’t spring fully formed out of Reagan’s forehead.
@sis_boom_baaah @politvidchannel During Watergate, Nixon was angry about his press coverage &amp; insisted there •should be• press outlets that would be friendly to him to put out his message the way he wanted it to be framed, so, though it took a while, I’d say Nixon’s administration was an inflection point.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB 😄	I was just reacting to the idea that you seemed to hold it against KH that she accepted DJT’s donation, when I find it entirely plausible that she didn’t know (then) what a sleazeball he was.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Beyond that, I’m not sure what your point is. Some people were more aware of him than others, with folks in NYC likely having the greatest awareness.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I presumed you deliberately chose that article from the Guardian to show there was international interest.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB In the article you linked, it says Salaam, who was 15 at the time, didn’t know who Trump was, when Trump was calling for their execution. I don’t know if he was a native New Yorker. Of course, that article in the Guardian was a closer look at •candidate• Trump, in 2016.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Sure, people had heard the name. I was vaguely aware he’d tried to buy the old Ambassador Hotel (fell thru), &amp; something about a golf course in Palos Verdes. Heard sth about divorces &amp; a casino.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB It’s not realistic to expect lifelong Californians to be have the same awareness of New York characters as you do yourself. We have our own characters. 🤪
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB You say you didn’t need the media to tell you DJT was vile &amp; morally bankrupt. The point was-you knew who he was. Your bio says you’re in NYC, &amp; I acknowledged already that New Yorkers were aware of him. Takei’s been quoted saying he didn’t really know who DJT was. I didn’t-then.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB These are her values. To doubt that based on those contributions requires ignoring the context I described upthread.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB As she’s ascended to more powerful positions, she’s consistently followed that path-working to make things better for the ones the system has failed. And when mistakes are made, she’s quick to own up &amp; accept responsibility.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I disagree on conflating. When KH became a lawyer, family &amp; friends expected she’d be a defense atty to fight back against the system. She said no, you’ve got to be on the •inside• to make changes. She worked hard &amp; used her power to shift the juggernaut to a new course.

@It_is_NunyaDB @ccjones1013 @philosophrob Nunya muted the thread, so won’t see this, but for others-		Overly simplistic summaries are often unjust.		Fairness requires taking context into consideration.		In a world of trolls launching smear campaigns, I am a proponent of facts, context, &amp; fairness.🕊
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I don’t have much, but I signed up for a small monthly contribution. The more of us who do that willingly, the less time she has to waste on fundraising. You decide for you. 	As for me, I’m in. 	🇺🇸🌊🕊
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB By pledging off Corp 💰, she’s made herself vulnerable vs candidates who take that cash. She’s not making a cynical pledge. She’s saying “I’ve got your back if you’ve got mine.” She’s putting her trust in •us• as an act of faith.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Also, I keep coming back to •us.• Citizens United wrought havoc. Dark money must be dealt with, but to do that, we’ve got to put our own candidates in position to take action, &amp; speaking for myself, I see that in Kamala Harris.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB And where Trump’s concerned, nobody had a crystal ball. New Yorkers say they’ve known for years he was a con, but this is Cali. Trump was “that TV Guy.” Heck, even George Takei was on his show in 2012. Times have changed, context is important.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Also, I have a question I don’t know the answer to. Did these Corps &amp; Trump donate to Kamala •only•, or did they also donate to her opponents? Many times they play both sides as an insurance policy. Failure to accept that money would only have put her at a disadvantage.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB If her •opponents• had pledged off Corp money when she hadn’t, then the criticism would be fair. That’s not the case here.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Kamala began as an unknown when she ran for DA in SF, &amp; made a name for herself locally. Then for Cali AG she had to make her name known statewide. It took time to build her brand &amp; get ordinary folks excited. Once she had that support base, she pledged off Corp money.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I get what you’re saying, but again, context is important. California is a huge state geographically, with very expensive media markets. Vermont...not so much. Clearly, when running for statewide office, a Cali candidate needs way more cash.

@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB I find the rush to judgment based on sparse info, &amp; devoid of context, to be disturbing. I’m not saying don’t judge. I’m saying we need to gather a lot more facts &amp; look at them in context to reach a fair &amp; unbiased opinion.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB The bigger the office, the more campaign money you need. I don’t know which of these donors were courted by the candidate, or which ones were courting her. I don’t know whose contributions she refused to accept. Do you?
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB We can clutch our pearls &amp; decry politicians accepting money from moneyed interests, but if we just plain folks weren’t bothering to fund candidates, they had little choice. Without campaign money, they’d lose. Period.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Until recently, most ordinary Americans didn’t pay much attention to politics, and fewer bothered sending campaign contributions. So, most politicians in office spent a portion of their time regularly courting •interested parties• to plead for funds. Sad fact, but universal.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Next, simple deduction.	Imagine you’re a candidate for office, you’re not well-known, &amp; you’re not wealthy. You have to raise enough campaign funds to be competitive. If your opponents raise big $$$ for their war chests, you have to as well, otherwise you’re out of the race.
@ccjones1013 @philosophrob @It_is_NunyaDB Hmm. I see the tone of the replies this is getting, so let me add a bit.	Begin with a bit of background, since context is important when evaluating anything.	https://t.co/Cwb8DPshUY

@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I do know you’ve posted “facts” that are blatantly false, used cheap manipulative tactics, &amp; presented rudimentary arguments that are obvious  logical fallacies.		Nothing you’ve posted on •this thread• is worthy of anyone’s regard.		Do better.  Be better.		💔🗽🌊🇺🇸🕊
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I don’t know if you’re a troll working for Putin. I don’t know if you’re a troll working for the GOP. I don’t know if you’re a sincere American who’s drunk too much GOP kool-aid &amp; has been suckered into their groupthink, emulating the troll tactics you see around you.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I •have• studied logic, and I encourage everyone else to. I’m unmoved by false, manipulative nonsense. A great portion of the smears I see are ludicrously juvenile.		“(Name target), really?”		Am I supposed to be lost to doubt from that? Really? https://t.co/SYNiUTepwW
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers The troll assumes the position of the arbiter of truth, &amp; pretends that if their target cannot adequately disprove a claim to the troll’s satisfaction (i.e. never), then the target is obligated to accept the troll’s version. Pure malevolent manipulation.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Another manipulative tactic is to assault the target with myriad false claims, challenging them to prove otherwise. If they start to respond to one, the troll bombards them using any excuse. “Oh, I notice you didn’t address this other claim! Oh, MSM is all lies!...”
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers We should all be mindful of such tactics so we can withstand them, and oppose them.	If you are, yourself, a sincere American with conservative views trying to persuade others, look for honest facts &amp; reasonable arguments. No more sneers, insinuations, falsehoods or fallacies.	🕊
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers It’s pure psychological warfare to unleash armies of bots/trolls pushing such positions to overwhelm folks until they join what •appears• to be the dominant pack, or are discouraged into silence, leaving the field to the trolls.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers I don’t believe all GOP-leaning trolls are Russian, but I’m keenly aware they do exist &amp; are working hard to amplify divisions. One tactic is to create a flood of posts all agreeing with each other, hoping that undecided/uninformed or insecure folks will feel inclined to join in.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Another logical fallacy is the argument ad hominem. Ignoring reasoning altogether &amp; just launching attacks against one’s opponent. Mudslinging smear campaigns abound &amp; you’re throwing mud around yourself. I’m not impressed.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers When people challenge me with obviously false arguments, I’m left to wonder about them. Are they sincere, but naïve? Unaware of the flaw in their reasoning? Are they deliberately deceptive &amp; manipulative? Bad faith actors working for their own selfish cause? Or somewhere between?
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers We can see the same false argument with DJT’s wall. The GOP claims you’re either for the wall, or else you’re for open borders. Either black or white. It’s false &amp; insulting &amp; no one should be fooled by it.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers You posited, “abortion at full term, really?”	That’s one extreme. The other extreme is “from the moment of conception.”	There’s a whole world of shades of gray in the middle which is where reality lies.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Have you ever heard of the black &amp; white fallacy? Arguments that posit there’s a position at •this• extreme, &amp; a position at •that• extreme &amp; dismiss or refuse to acknowledge anything in the middle. When it’s black or white &amp; no shades of gray, it’s a false argument.
@mikeruhland3 @bmaygers Have you ever studied logic? (Honest question.) Some arguments can be easily identified as false by their very structure. When I listen to “news” from the right, or to GOP politicians, I hear a litany of false arguments, manipulative smears, &amp; lies that are easily fact-checked.

@Fabi88033162 @RashidaTlaib Assuming you’re not a troll (and I have serious doubts), your attempts to sow fear, to divide people based on religion, pushing for others to join you in implementing a law which would violate the very 1st right in the Bill of Rights, are unconscionable.
@Fabi88033162 @RashidaTlaib Amendment 1-Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, •or prohibiting the free exercise thereof•; (etc). It comes •before• the right to free speech.
@Fabi88033162 @RashidaTlaib Fabi, one of the hashtags you tweeted with your video upthread said to ban Islam. This is a problem, especially since lots of people came to this country fleeing religious persecution. Since you have a flag &amp; eagle in your avatar, I hope you also respect the Constitution.
@Fabi88033162 @RashidaTlaib Ah, now I see others are also tweeting the same thing.

@Ehac10 What was passive/aggressive, here?
@Ehac10 I see your article (from 2015), and I’ll raise you this one (from 2017). 😁	https://t.co/ET5eY5IytL
@Ehac10 And yes, propaganda sites do post true facts—if everything were lies they’d lose their audience. But one has to tread so carefully to discern true, balanced stories from stories spun six ways from Sunday, and the weird baseless ones. Better to avoid such sites, is my thinking. 🤭
@Ehac10 As for the other, I’m always startled when I see Americans linking to Sputnik or RT...unless they’re offering an example of what the Russ propagandists are up to.
@Ehac10 I know it’s become standard practice on the right to sneer at mainstream media, but that’s a blatantly manipulative tactic to condition people to distrust reliable news sources. When people try to use manipulative tactics on me, it instantly puts me on my guard. How ‘bout you?

@lsockett1 @davidmweissman Conservative Christians see themselves as having made this sacrifice (of their own values) for the greater good. They’ve been so manipulated to hate their countrymen, yet see themselves as heroes. (I’m generalizing, of course.)
@lsockett1 @davidmweissman We used to think of compromise as reaching across the aisle to meet the opposition halfway. Now these folks have become so convinced we’re “demoncrats,” that they’ve had to “compromise” their own Christian values as the only way to stop us in our tracks. Diff definition of word.
@lsockett1 @davidmweissman I used to be baffled at people who consider themselves as devout Christians, wondering why they’d support a guy like DJT. Then heard these folks talking about how far they’d gone to “compromise,” &amp; it became clear.
@lsockett1 @davidmweissman It’s more than that, tho’. 	We have right-wing media outlets deliberately fanning hatred, &amp; targeted social media campaigns exploiting &amp; expanding the divisions.

@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Now Russia is trying to rewrite their own history about why they invaded Afghanistan, falsely claiming it was because of terrorist attacks. Not true. But in cabinet meeting 2 days ago, DJT suddenly brought it up-Russ was right to invade ‘cuz of terrorist attacks. Parroting Putin.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom You can imagine Putin saying, “Hey Donald, Don’t let those awful Montenegrins join NATO. They’re horrible, aggressive. They’ll start WW3!” Donny hears, he says, he shoves.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Coup failed, link to Russ GRU found. Montenegro did join NATO, &amp; at meeting, DJT did a weird thing &amp; physically shoved the Montenegrin Prime Minister aside—the guy Putin tried to have murdered.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Russ GRU tried to arrange a coup in Montenegro, only foiled ‘cuz one of the local plotters got cold feet &amp; turned himself in. They would have kidnapped or killed the Prime Minister, &amp; stopped Montenegro from joining NATO.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom Trump gave an interview where he suddenly started talking about how the Montenegrin people were strong &amp; aggressive, &amp; next thing you know, they’d start WW3. Off-the-chart weird at the time. But Montenegro wanted to join NATO, &amp; Putin wanted to stop them.
@spencerwindes @parfitt_tom No, not history. Russ propaganda.	Putin spread misinfo in Belarus that Poland was going to attack, to get Belarus to move closer to Russia, politically. In first 2 wks of DJT presidency, WH aides asked US intel for info about Poland amassing forces to attack. (?) Lie, from Putin.

@JCGrant7984 @VictorKilbourn @jmcauliff1 @realDonaldTrump Any estimate you see, drill down &amp; find out what assumptions it made. A search will bring up flaws in methodology (sometimes glaringly obvious.)

@JCGrant7984 @VictorKilbourn @jmcauliff1 @realDonaldTrump As for cost, estimates vary greatly. Undocumented immigrants often pay taxes, but are reluctant to take advantage of available services for fear of discovery &amp; deportation. Partisans create outrageous estimates using suspect assumptions to “sell” their own point of view.
@JCGrant7984 @VictorKilbourn @jmcauliff1 @realDonaldTrump As for crime committed by immigrants (both documented &amp; undocumented) the fact is both groups commit less crime than native-born people.	https://t.co/Kq2K2rikiQ

@Gwenda @BillStewart415 @cmpriest Down toward the end of the article, there’s an interesting bit about a gender studies experiment showing differing perceptions of the biographies of fictional John Burr, vs equal but female Ann Burr.

@lizfones @UnholiestJedi @mdtoorder @kurteichenwald The other part is “aid and comfort” to an enemy, and judicial interpretations decided an adversary is not an enemy, legally speaking, until war has been formally declared.
@Gwenda @BillStewart415 @cmpriest I’m sceptical. Unless Ms. Petri can put forth some names of women candidates she •does like•, I’ve got to wonder if some of her negative perception isn’t based on thoroughly ingrained societal notions of powerful women.
