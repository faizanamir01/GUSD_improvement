@FoxNews Society needs "social media control" more than gun control. Snapchat, twitter and instagram are the driving forces behind these acts of violence. Kids use them to push other kids to the breaking point. Kids do not need to be bullied online or exposed to porn at 12 years old.
@NBCNews The blood is REALLY on twitter, Snapchat, instagram and the kids  themselves. Kids use these mechanisms to isolate, bully and harass others. Suicide and shootings are the result.  Regulated social media.
