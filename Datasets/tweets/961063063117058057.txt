@FoxOfWilliamSt @nicholadrummond They need to put more money in to defence, especially the UK and France. Germany just needs to spend it differently, mainly with their navy.
@FoxOfWilliamSt @nicholadrummond Thus my concern at the large amount of Russian MBTs, Europe and The USA together could stop them but it would take time for the US to move their forces over, and NATO in Europe is outnumbered by Russian MBTs
@FoxOfWilliamSt @nicholadrummond Yes so does Poland, but their tanks are of far lesser quality
