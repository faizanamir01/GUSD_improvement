@judybeansdeux @mommyinaz @ScottPresler And the areas where a physical barrier isn't possible? I'm asking you genuinely though: would you cross the Rio Grande to protect your family? 		Because I would.
@judybeansdeux @mommyinaz @ScottPresler Think for a second: They know how dangerous it is. They do it anyway.		That is how desperately they need to leave their situation, whatever that situation is.		Due to the case backlog, getting asylum is nearly impossible.		If your family was in danger... What would you do?
@mommyinaz @ScottPresler @judybeansdeux I cannot begin to put myself in their shoes, because as you said, going through that would be atrocious. 		But I fail to see how using their experiences as reasoning to build a wall logically follows.
@SubinVJ95 @ScottPresler Rape culture IS here in the US. 		Genuine question: when someone says "rape culture" what do you think they mean?
@SubinVJ95 @ScottPresler I think you misunderstand their findings. 		No one said one in five women are raped. One in five women are sexually assaulted - that includes a wide array of sexual acts, not just rape.
Dear neighbor shoveling snow in sandals: are you okay...? 		Midwest af.
@LiveFromLiz @doumindifi @ScottPresler Again, I never said we shouldn't care. 		We should - about all survivors. 		What I'm saying is it's not a justification for building a wall, and shouldn't be used as political ammunition.
@SubinVJ95 @ScottPresler Dude that article uses reported crime to attempt undermining the CDCs findings. You can't use reported crime stats to make any clear claims regarding a crime that is woefully underreported. 		That's the reason for the CDC study in the first place.
@BrendaG67213708 @doumindifi @ScottPresler That's not what I said...? 		I said actively participates in rape culture. 		But I suppose you think that's "just locker room talk". 🤷🏻‍♀️
@BrendaG67213708 @doumindifi @ScottPresler They're putting themselves and their families at risk largely because they are running from situations that are MORE dangerous than the risk they take traveling here. 		They attempt to enter illegally because it is practically impossible to get asylum status.
When people are so offended by actual facts that they strawman the fuck out of your profile. 😂😂😂 https://t.co/ck0S1T0xZF
@doumindifi @BrendaG67213708 @ScottPresler What does that have to do with the effectiveness of "strategically deployed physical barriers" to stop rapists...? 		I'm confused.
@BrendaG67213708 @doumindifi @ScottPresler To be clear, yes, we do have to start somewhere. 		But "strategically deployed physical barriers" won't stop rapists from assaulting people (women &amp; men alike).
@BrendaG67213708 @doumindifi @ScottPresler .... I'm sorry, but that doesn't make it any less hypocritical for a president who actively participates in rape culture to cite sexual assault statistics as a means of advancing a largely unrelated political agenda.
@SubinVJ95 @ScottPresler You realize the 1 in 5 stat is from the CDC right...? https://t.co/etEvYytnW3
@doumindifi @ScottPresler Yes, exactly. 		All sexual assault survivors. From everywhere. Women and men. 		I'm not saying "well it's everywhere so we shouldn't care" I'm saying "We cannot selectively care."
@judybeansdeux @ScottPresler No, not at all - I'm saying that it's important to acknowledge that this isn't a problem unique to women crossing the border. 		We cannot selectively care about survivors, whether they are American or immigrants or applying for asylum.
@ScottPresler @judybeansdeux I was pointing out that it happens everywhere, and is a problem everywhere. 		It's not fair, at all, to discuss this as if it's only a problem that applies to those crossing the border.
@judybeansdeux @ScottPresler Like I'm genuinely confused. 		Do you legitimately think immigrants are coming here to rape Americans?
@judybeansdeux @ScottPresler ... what...?
"Strategic deployment of physical barriers..." 		So... A wall? @realDonaldTrump
@ScottPresler One in five American women are sexually assaulted - this is not a problem unique to people crossing the border.

@JeffWer10378750 @JohnQNobody1 @TroutPlayz @DanielTurnerPTF @RyanAFournier Yeeeaaahhhhh that's why I asked.
@JohnQNobody1 @TroutPlayz @DanielTurnerPTF @RyanAFournier Do you mind explaining why you think a difference in population would make the system less effective?
@TroutPlayz @DanielTurnerPTF @RyanAFournier I can see how that would be concerning. What are your thoughts on borderline socialist countries - like Scandinavian nations in the EU? And... When you say "open borders", what do you mean by that? (Again, genuinely asking. ☺️)
@DanielTurnerPTF @RyanAFournier I'm genuinely curious: what makes you think the Democrats don't want to move the US forward? (Legitimately asking, to discuss. 🤗)
@SchuylerTaylor4 @delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson He definitely should. And he wants to - but the law hasn't caught up with his situation, which is why this is even a headline in the first place. 		If he were competing in the right division... It's likely this wouldn't even be news.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HIASrefugees Dear everyone criticising her choice of donation: WTF do you expect her to do?? Split the money between 7,000 people?? Give each govt employee like... A quarter (probably less)? Or host the hunger games for furloughed workers? 🤦🏻‍♀️
@SchuylerTaylor4 @fanowrestling @delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson It does, yes! I'm not arguing it doesn't. 		What I'm arguing is it doesn't give him an advantage over his peers with the same level of testosterone - those competing in the mens division. The only difference is theirs is naturally occurring, and his is prescribed by his doctor.
@SchuylerTaylor4 @delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson The terms themselves have been conflated, yeah - but the concepts of sex and gender have been separate. And regardless - now that the distinction has been clearly made, we should move forward recognizing them as different areas of identity. ☺️
@Nancidee33 @delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson That was a sarcastic question mark. Lol. Sorry if that wasn't clear. 😂		Yes, they're exceedingly dated policies.
@realDonaldTrump Oh come on. So they're like... Metaphorically paying for it now, too? 😂😂😂
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson So... Because it's always been this way, that's how it must be moving forward?
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson So we're in a trolly car scenario and you're choosing the lesser of two evils? Everyone's rights are valid here.		We don't HAVE to choose one or the other. He could just compete against other boys, and it wouldn't even be a headline for anyone to argue about. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson Okay but if the law is the problem - Mack is NOT. So, punishing him makes no sense and doesn't address the actual issue. Changing policy is the only real way to move forward.
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson So your solution is life isn't perfect, so we shouldn't do anything...?
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson I mean to me it sounds like we're on the same page - because allowing him to compete in the appropriate division solves all of those problems.
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson The competition he wants to fight already HAS those levels of testosterone. He did not choose to compete in the women's division.
@FQShav @realDonaldTrump Okay so spell it out for me - what's the bigger picture?
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson So you're saying that his testosterone, supplemented to levels that match his peers who were born male, enhance his performance so much so that the playing field isn't level?
@FQShav @realDonaldTrump You can find the demand estimate of 40-50 tons reported to the Senate in this hearing transcript from 2015 - it's likely increased a bit, but would still fit into those two 40 foot shipping containers I mentioned. https://t.co/ijjGXfrfSR
@kstraith @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson The medication isn't taken for the purpose of enhancing performance.
@FQShav @realDonaldTrump Healing US-Mexico relations on the other hand, and giving poppy growers a profitable alternative crop with which to provide for their families, would cut off the opium supply for manufacturers. 		A wall is not the answer.
@FQShav @realDonaldTrump They've calculated the amount needed to satisfy the demand in the states - and it's approximately two 40 foot shipping carriers for a year. Experts (former DEA) state it's likely a majority is entering at legal POEs, small quantities at a time. A wall won't fix that.
@delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson He's not on steroids - he's on a testosterone regimine prescribed by his physician. ☺️ Also - "biological gender" isn't a thing because gender isn't physical - "birth sex" is though. I'm assuming that's what you meant..?
@Nancidee33 @delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson Yes?
@FQShav @realDonaldTrump If we're talking specifically heroin, not illicit drugs generally, the 2018 DEA threat report states that the vast majority of heroin seizures happen at legal entry points, not from those entering illegally - a wall will not prevent drugs from coming in at legal points of entry.
@delawarenole @MattWalshBlog @EWErickson They've made it clear why they won't allow it - archaic policies regarding "gender" (by which they mean "sex") on ones birth certificate.
@FQShav @realDonaldTrump So..... It will stop cargo ships and planes? Because the heroin comes in on cargo ships &amp; planes (according to the DEA).
@MattWalshBlog @EWErickson This is a man, forced to compete against women. 		He asked for his division status to be changed - Texas will not allow it.
@ManMet80 @SocialPowerOne1 @realDonaldTrump How are that many of them fake?? 😳 I did like 10 in basically 30 seconds.

@ssholesob Whether this has happened in the past is not what this conversation is about, though. This is about the president of the United States feeling the need to claim that any organized effort not aligned with his ideology is a sensational, conspiratorial scenario. It's ludicrous.

@ssholesob I mean, a parallel example: I think the world sucks because of corporations who pollute our air - but I don't HATE them. I hate what they're doing. What they're doing can change. ❤️ Hate isn't productive. 🤷🏻‍♀️☺️ Conversation is, though.
@ssholesob And that "locker room" scenario is very, very real - and people like you (and in some situations, me) have the social position to say something, and undermine the systems that cause these problems to begin with. ✌🏻 It does suck. You're right - and it does make things harder.
@ssholesob It's not about who HAS nice cars - it's about who DOESN'T, and it's about why. 		That's a gross oversimplification, of course.
@ssholesob I see where you're coming from, I do. But here's the thing - it's NOT about physical whiteness. It's not about people who are white. It's about whiteness as a concept - whiteness as a construction of historically enforced superiority that persists in our social structures.
@ssholesob 4. I don't hate anyone (except Nazis. I definitely hate Nazis.) 		And stating that the fact that our world is organized around a particular group does not imply hate toward that group. That's not a conclusion that logically follows.
@ssholesob 3. I never said any of that? 🤷🏻‍♀️ You personally are not necessarily the problem - this is both a micro and a macro issue, and again, if you're interested, I'd love to give you some resources to read about institutionally based privilege &amp; it's impacts.
@ssholesob 2. I don't disagree that you live by the "sweat of your brow" - saying that white men have privilege isn't discounting how hard you as an individual work. Everyone has areas of their life where they experience privilege - it doesn't make us bad people.
@ssholesob 1. That's still not racist. It might be prejudiced, and you might not agree. But it's not racist.
@ssholesob Except what she's saying is emperically true.		Even the LANGUAGE OF OUR CONSTITUTION is organized around how white (cisgender, Christian) men experience life.

@ssholesob @johnpavlovitz How does that align with what John said, exactly?
@ssholesob @johnpavlovitz I disagree - just because you don't agree with something doesn't mean it's "intended" to piss people off. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 		Seems like it was intended to make a point about how unqualified and incapable of seeing the big picture our supreme leader is.
@ssholesob @johnpavlovitz I did indeed compare "ridiculously, immaturely, and nonproductively targeting global leaders on Twitter" to "nonproductively writing immature, foolish notes in middle school," because it's a fair comparison. And..... This is a different thread. So.
@ssholesob @johnpavlovitz ... are you comparing me telling one guy to fuck off to our president continuing to threaten global leaders on Twitter? Is that what's going on here? Because those two topics aren't comparable. Gym creeper results in me being annoyed, and the latter is ACTUALLY DANGEROUS.

I couldn't fucking believe it I was so stunned I just looked at the guy, with the most intense "exercising-bitch-face" I could consciously contort my face into, and got up and left. But we need to fucking talk about this.
I had headphones in, because if I'm going to bike 15 miles I wanna be pumped up, right? Like a person who exercises. SO. This guy, I shit you not, TAPS MY SHOULDER and says "You know it's scientifically proven that if you smile while you exercise you'll enjoy it more". #WTF
Literally just left the gym because THE SAME old creep who consistently uses the bike next to me did it AGAIN.
I’ve been having the worst day. #SaturdaySucks

Dear passive-aggressive neighbor,		My dog is barking because your music is loud. 		Turning the volume up is not going to help you. I promise.
Dear everyone who sits in their car for ten minutes after your gas is DONE PUMPING, 		STOP BEING HORRIBLE.
@ssholesob @akkad_sin @KamalaHarris It's not the "ability to survive without outside help". 		It's the "ability to survive without relying on the modification of another human being's body". 		That's why I'm saying it's not an effective comparison. Fetuses and toddlers need entirely different things.
@ssholesob @kashanacauley @Mikel_Jollett I'm not blaming her at all - neither was OP. What I'm saying is she's certainly not helping. 		The failures of our educational system are too far reaching to be blamed on one person.
@ssholesob @akkad_sin @KamalaHarris That's exactly what I'm saying - they're not comparable examples. ☺️
@ssholesob @akkad_sin @KamalaHarris Lol. No, I haven't. But that doesn't change the fact that a toddler's attention doesn't have to come from it's biological parents. Adoptive/Foster parents or other family members can also meet those needs. The toddler isn't physically attached to their caregivers' bodies.
@ssholesob @akkad_sin @KamalaHarris Actually that's a totally different topic entirely - a toddler isn't dependent upon anyone's body. They're dependent upon attention, but that attention can come from anyone - and it doesn't require that the person giving their attention go through bodily changes.
@kashanacauley @Mikel_Jollett She's clearly one of those people who thinks if you smile enough everyone will just believe you. 		Like... No, Betsy. Your smile doesn't make you look trustworthy, because your statements are actual gibberish.
@reductiologic Incompetent is almost too kind, given her "responses" to those questions. 		It's shameful. Just plain shameful.
@Americas_Uncle @PKaminske @KamalaHarris You do know that's not what I'm referring to, right?
I genuinely wish I was surprised. https://t.co/kc4mQ8eqXH
@babs_bsca @PKaminske @KamalaHarris Okay but which life? There are two lives in question. The life of the mother, and the life of the child.
@akkad_sin @KamalaHarris Is a bundle of cells alive? Could it thrive and continue to develop without the help of a woman's body?
@babs_bsca @PKaminske @KamalaHarris You do realize those aren't actually provided services in the US, right?
@babs_bsca @PKaminske @KamalaHarris And if the mother's life is in danger?
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris I understand - and you're exactly right, actually. Consenting to sex is totally separate from consenting to carry a child to term. They're separate bodily actions, with separate hormonal and physical involvements etc.
Is #daylightsavings a good excuse for not getting out of bed until 2pm?
@PKaminske @Americas_Uncle @KamalaHarris I think it's a matter of perspective about 90% of the time. 		I mean... I'm not a fan of dead babies either. But a small ball of cells doesn't constitute a human life. 		In short, it's a language problem. When the terms are defined differently by each side, debate is impossible.
@PKaminske @babs_bsca @KamalaHarris And also a strong foster and adoption system, paying workers a living wage, equal opportunity for education.......
@babs_bsca @PKaminske @KamalaHarris Abortion isn't a contraceptive method - abortion is a last resort. 		Using contraception isn't 100% effective. And it's not affordable or accessible for everyone.
@Americas_Uncle @PKaminske @KamalaHarris And that's great for the women you've met. I'm happy for them. Their doctors must be fantastic.		But the women you've met aren't representative of the entire US population.
@CherylBaldwin @KamalaHarris So are you saying that life begins when a ball of 16 cells exists within a uterus?
@CherylBaldwin @Mr_Universe2017 @KamalaHarris Because I was responding to your comment?
@DeepStExposer @Sage_dude @KamalaHarris On the other side of the coin, forcing a woman to go through the bodily changes that occur during pregnancy violates her rights to bodily autonomy.
@TaylorPPorter @Sage_dude @KamalaHarris Unfortunately, most men can't carry a pregnancy. If they could, that would 100% be their decision - the problem is, no one, man or woman, can interfere with "bodily autonomy" without infringing upon the rights of the person in question.
@Americas_Uncle @PKaminske @KamalaHarris When you say "not true" which part are you referring to? That women are denied tubal ligations? Because we totally are. Even in cases where a woman has #endometriosis or other medical concerns, who would likely be unable to safely carry a pregnancy to term.
@CherylBaldwin @Mr_Universe2017 @KamalaHarris Yes. When a baby is miscarried, you are 100% correct. They have died of natural causes. It is exceedingly sad. 		Here's the problem. That baby can't remain in the mother's womb. It HAS to be removed, for her safety. And that's not always prompted naturally by that mom's body.
@CherylBaldwin @KamalaHarris I hear you - completely. Abortions that late are heartbreaking. But when you actually look at the numbers, abortions beyond the first trimester are not the rule, they are the exception. Approx. 89-92% of all abortions performed occur in trimester 1. https://t.co/qSOrIvrLyi
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris It's also referred to as "bodily autonomy". It's the concept that you cannot, under ANY circumstances, be forced to do anything with your body that you haven't consented to - even if it would save a life.		A good example is organ donation - it must be totally voluntary.
@CherylBaldwin @KamalaHarris I'd love to - but I can't. 		I'm under 30 with no children. Additionally, that procedure isn't covered by my insurance. 		But that's also moot - my argument isn't about me. It's about all women having access to life saving care. I'm merely an example.
I'll take "How-to-make-absolutely-everything-political" for 400, Alex. 😂		#DaylightSavings #ComedyGold https://t.co/szYxUr76B7
@TallManShort @KamalaHarris You realize your argument ALSO supports killing a living being, right? 		And infringing on that being's bodily autonomy beforehand?
The whole #bot thing is getting a little out of control. 		Not everyone you disagree with is a bot. 		Come on, people. https://t.co/0HRtBlvZLV
@akkad_sin @KamalaHarris Again with the bot thing. 		Not everyone who disagrees with you is a bot. 		Back to the point - abortion is a lot of things. Murder is not one of them.
@landsdowne9 @DonMills33 @KamalaHarris I also don't see a flock of pro-lifers waiting to adopt children born to mothers financially incapable of supporting a child. 🤷🏻‍♀️		But maybe that's just me.
@Leahh70 @CherylBaldwin @KamalaHarris Of course that’s a fairly effective way to avoid pregnancy (not 100% though) - but you run into the same concerns about access. Not all insurance plans are required to cover birth control anymore.
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris And that’s a totally fair stance - not one I agree with, but one I can understand. 		It doesn’t, unfortunately, address the question of bodily integrity.
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris That’s dependent upon how you define “life”. And how you see “bodily integrity”. 		For example. If my sister needed a kidney, under NO circumstances could I be forced to give her a kidney - even if it would save her life.		Because it’s my body, not hers.
@PKaminske @KamalaHarris Yeah it’s super awful, actually. 		Many docs have conversations with women younger than 30 to explain they “may change their minds” and that they therefore won’t perform the procedure.
@TallManShort @KamalaHarris How many of those abortions were performed on women who WOULD HAVE died in childbirth - but who didn’t, because they had access to healthcare? 		The answer is we don’t know, because they LIVED.
@DonMills33 @KamalaHarris Okay, but that didn’t answer my question. 		How do you define life, as related to abortion? When is a “baby” no longer a “fetus”? Or are they EVER a “fetus”?
@TallManShort @KamalaHarris So can childbirth.
@akkad_sin @KamalaHarris Honesty: abortion, in certain situations, is life saving for women who wouldn’t survive childbirth.
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris I’ll be honest, I don’t think they’re referring to the constitution when they say it’s a right - I’m not, when I say it. 		But honestly... aren’t the rights to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” undermined when one lacks equal access to healthcare? I know mine are.
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris I’m not attacking - it was a genuine question. 		Do you think healthcare should be a right? I’m not asking whether it’s in the constitution (though the rights to life and liberty seem to spell it out fairly well in my opinion) I’m asking about your opinion.
@CherylBaldwin @KamalaHarris As a woman with a significant physical disability that would most likely cause me to die in childbirth, I have a question for you. 		If I became pregnant, and found out at 8 weeks, is preserving the fetus's right to life more important than mine? 		Abortion IS healthcare.
@DonMills33 @KamalaHarris How do you define "life"? What qualifies as a "baby" to you?
@CentristSM @KamalaHarris So you genuinely think we don't have a right to accessible healthcare?
@Sage_dude @KamalaHarris 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Yes. A million times yes.
@KamalaHarris And that doesn't even get into the "guidelines" surrounding women getting their tubes tied..... If you're under 30 and have less than three kids, it's nearly impossible - even if it's covered by insurance.
RT @KamalaHarris: Equal opportunity is only possible when women have safe, affordable access to reproductive health care — including aborti…
@darik_kuta Honest answer, I have a joint disorder. Makes things complicated.

@ssholesob @darik_kuta @Spanky5000 @RealJamesWoods Curious: when you say they're being played, what are you referring to? 		I've had difficulty piecing together what that's referring to, though I keep seeing it being brought up.
@ssholesob @darik_kuta @Spanky5000 @RealJamesWoods And that's super true - but I'm not necessarily referring to the impact's nature; its existence at all is astounding. How much more empowered to speak do you think Gen Z will be, knowing that a collective barrage of tweets (and other media approaches) so quickly lead to change?😅

Dear anyone-within-earshot-of-my-apartment,		I am sorry. My dog believes the sky is falling. It is actually just roofers. He does not know that. He is a dog. 		Please don't hate us. He just wants to protect you from the end of the world.
@ssholesob @darik_kuta @Spanky5000 @RealJamesWoods (Social Media Marketing &amp; analysis is actually my industry. 😅)
@ssholesob @darik_kuta @Spanky5000 @RealJamesWoods I think that may be a matter of perspective, given how people are using social media to advocate, and to hold others accountable. And gen Z (&lt;21yo) is particularly interesting - they grew up knowing the whole world could see what they say. That wasn't the case for Gen Y, or X.
@ssholesob @darik_kuta @Spanky5000 @RealJamesWoods The two are related - no doubt. But ideology and identity are still separate entities.
@darik_kuta @Spanky5000 @ssholesob @RealJamesWoods Exactly. The main reason we have such a distinctly partisan system is neither side is willing to meet in the middle. Instead we call each other names and attack each other's identities - when  99.99% of the time our ideology, not our identity, is what policy is addressing.
@HLRowe1 @darik_kuta @irishrygirl I've actually rarely had that experience - and I tend to call people out on racist claims. (Which should make sense given my position on "isms" expressed earlier. 😅)		That's neither here nor there though.
Dude. 		You can't just arbitrarily decide everyone who disagrees with you is a Russian bot. That's not how this works. https://t.co/LqbIFaLBmC
@Spanky5000 What. Part. Of. What. I'm. Saying. Do. You. Disagree. With. 		If you're not interested in having real conversation, fine. If you're not interested in compromise, fine. But standing on principles you can't describe isn't what an informed voter/citizen does......
@HLRowe1 @darik_kuta @irishrygirl The problem here is that your statement still categorizes people. 		Not all wall supporters behave that way - it's the louder, more extreme, minority that have those kinds of responses.
@HLRowe1 @darik_kuta @irishrygirl You'll catch more flies with honey than with vinegar - by which I mean, calling someone racist will automatically put them on the defense. 		Pointing out that a particular idea they ascribe to has racist underpinnings is different. Attack the argument, not the person. ☺️
@HLRowe1 @darik_kuta @irishrygirl I totally agree. 100%. Claims about taxpayer dollars and negative econ. impact are so wrong it's laughable - and honestly, you could be right. All wall supporters COULD be racist. But that's not necessarily true, and beyond that, categorizing that way is a barrier to discussion.
@darik_kuta @HLRowe1 @irishrygirl But that's more of a philosophical argument than a practical one. As a person with a physical disability, even people I care about deeply and who I know are NOT ableist have treated me in an ableist way. 		Behavior is a funny thing. By which I mean it's complex AF.
@darik_kuta @HLRowe1 @irishrygirl The wall is racist. Largely, the conversation surrounding the wall is racist. 		That does NOT mean all wall supporters are racist.		Unless you ascribe to the belief (as I do) that anyone not belonging to a particular minority group unconsciously behaves "ist-ly" to that minority.
Someone please tell me why this is happening. Please. https://t.co/VKeczDGdNi
@ssholesob @Spanky5000 @RealJamesWoods He sent that reply 10 hours ago, while I was at work. Not three days ago...?
@Spanky5000 @ssholesob @RealJamesWoods I'm asking you to actually engage in real discourse - which, last time I checked, is what America is about. 		So. Again. What part of what I'm saying do you disagree with?
@CapitaLiszt @RealJamesWoods Can it not be argued that to be "well equipped" requires more than just a tool? Also necessary is the knowledge and requisite practice to be able to effectively utilize that tool?

@incredulous_us And I definitely think social media does a lot to amplify those feelings, too! It's a lot easier to argue unceasingly with someone when you can't see or hear them. 😅
@cancunbound2022 I can see how that would be overwhelming. 🙃 A sensible conversation can't be one sided, you know?
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl And we need to do it fast. 		A bipartisan deadlock forces us to waste time, while people die.
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm not saying a ban wouldn't help. I'm not saying that staunch 2a supporters don't have a right to own firearms, either.		I'm saying there's more than one way to skin a cat. 		We need to choose the one that will be the most effective compromise.
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl And no. That doesn't mean that calculated individuals who plan intentionally to massacre people won't be able to get a gun. Arguably they could go through training and purchase their firearm - but here's the thing. 		Those aren't the people who would be impacted by a ban anyway.
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl So. The solution, is keep guns out of the hands of people who are not trained, who are not responsible, and who are not competent. 		That way, 2a supporters can have their guns - provided they're responsible, trained, and competent.
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl Many people who have decided that only one solution is the right solution - well, what's the ACTUAL problem? Not that people have guns. Not that people have mental illness. Not that the NRA is lobbying etc. etc. 		The real, true, ACTUAL problem here is people who shouldn't (...3)
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl Too much tied up in the "rights" conversation, and there are too many interpretations of archaic language to get the two groups to agree. 		That ALSO doesn't matter. What matters, is, as my grandma used to tell me, "there's more than one way to skin a cat." There are too (...2)
@gtryder2000 @darik_kuta @medium_hell @irishrygirl Okay. Personally, I agree. I don't think civilians should have those guns. 		But my personal feelings don't matter - what matters is keeping us safe. We can't get there without compromise. The left is NOT going to get the right to give up gun ownership. Period. There is (1...)
@caprityper @RealJamesWoods Definitely. ☺️		But you should also be trained - and, arguably, it doesn't say "well regulated firearms" it is referring to the militia itself when it uses that term. So... The militia's members.
@darik_kuta @Mr_Raffino @irishrygirl The guy I was responding to. He might have blocked you too. You know, the one who called you a "buffoon".
@Mr_Raffino @darik_kuta @irishrygirl He blocked me. 😂😂😂 Just so you know.
Okay. So, is it just me, or does blocking people you disagree with create an echo chamber of your own ideas...? 		Like. We're going to disagree. We're humans. That doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to people with other opinions. 😒
@Mr_Raffino @darik_kuta @irishrygirl It's reasonable to disagree with someone. 		It's unkind to call them names.
@LenairH I totally agree. 		In many cases, those who voted for him excused his actions in favor of his words (usually words denying the validity of the previously mentioned actions; example: sexual assault.)		It was irresponsible, and now we're here.
@B192Q @McCawfee @Terrikwv @irishrygirl @darik_kuta That's a reasonable position, and I'm glad you articulated it. ☺️		Honestly, my biggest concern is that we will remain in a political deadlock - without compromise from both extremes, we won't achieve meaningful change.
@B192Q @McCawfee @Terrikwv @irishrygirl @darik_kuta To call a group of people "GOP Sympathizers" illustrates that you aren't hearing my argument. 		My argument is that there aren't two distinct parties, &amp; the people you're taking about are the most vocal extremes on either end. Not the less impassioned majority, who are moderate.
@Allie_F @darik_kuta @irishrygirl Definitely not! People shouldn't be hungry. Period. I don't care who they are or where they're from. 		But I don't think he was saying that either.
@cancunbound2022 @Cara0309 @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl Only magnifies those feelings, and gives those statements reach. 		If more moderately minded individuals spent time engaging in honest discussion with one another and with those they disagree with, I think we'd reach a point that the extremes would resonate less loudly. (2/2)
@cancunbound2022 @Cara0309 @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl I totally understand what you're saying. 		And all I can say to that is commonly, those kinds of hyperbolic or blatantly illogical and inflammatory comments (you know the ones I'm talking about 😅) are fueled by fear, and they're very emotional. And a social media environment (1)
@cancunbound2022 @Cara0309 @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl I'm not suggesting there is. I'm super anti-wall.		But that doesn't make it less important to listen to the concerns of people who AREN'T super anti-wall. Even if it's just to find out that their worries can be addressed by sharing facts and data - people deserve to be heard.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl I get why that would sound impossible - but hear me out. 		None of us are ever going to reach solutions to the problems that mean the most to us without meaningfully engaging people who disagree with our stance(s). Judgment is easy. Conversation is hard. Worth it, but hard.
@Cara0309 @darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl Exactly. ☺️ "Either/Or" is super useless. Compromise is where it's at.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl If I came across as condescending, I apologize. I was just trying to make clear that my Twitter feed isn't a particularly accurate way to judge me - I was using myself as an example.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl You can't effectively, categorically decide the nature of someone's character based on retweets. 		As I've said. We're far more complex than that.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl Sigh. 		And that, right there, is why meaningful discourse between the sides of the aisle doesn't happen. 		If I decided he was a hateful person because he disagreed with my stance on an issue, and that caused me to stop valuing his opinion, then I'VE FAILED.
@darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl And that's what's supposed to be in place now. Green card status (legal residency) leads to naturalization. 		But we make it so damn hard to get there.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl Please don't define people by what they post to an imaginary wall on a social media platform. 		We are so, so much more complicated than that. And not recognizing that complexity does us ALL a disservice.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl Sigh. Have you looked at my feed?		I look like the lefty-ist left leftist that has ever walked the Earth.		I retweet #ParklandStudents because I value their voices - even if I don't agree with their specific words. 		I retweet socialists because #healthcare keeps people alive.
@McCawfee @darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl I'll say it again, louder, for the people in the back: a bipartisan stance that values party affiliation over ideological alignment misses the point of democracy. https://t.co/ATo6sKTudi
@McCawfee @Terrikwv @irishrygirl @darik_kuta I repeat: a bipartisan stance that values party affiliation over ideological alignment misses the point of democracy.
@darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl A fair point - but in my opinion that would hit the economy more than I think we expect. 		I would lean toward simplifying the immigration process itself - and even potentially, making it more affordable. It's over $1,000 to even APPLY for a green card.
@darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl And to understand that foundation, requires understanding the language being used to express it. The rift between the far left &amp; the far right does nothing to facilitate conversation because even the language they use to describe an issue is defined by their feelings toward it.
@cancunbound2022 @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl The middle ground is revised policy, based on verifiable facts.		I see no reason to build a wall without first attempting to solve this problem with sheets of paper and lengthy conversations on Capitol Hill.		If policy reform doesn't do it, we come back to physical barriers.
@darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl I retweet things all the time that I don't 100% agree with - or from people with whom I don't completely agree, who happened to make a good point. 		A bipartisan stance that values party affiliation over ideological alignment misses the point of democracy.
@cancunbound2022 @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl I totally agree! My personal feeling is that in reality, there is a moderate majority out there. And, that they're largely quiet, because (as individuals with moderate beliefs) they aren't wildly offended when one "extreme" side or the other expresses a stance.
@cancunbound2022 @darik_kuta @Terrikwv @irishrygirl It's still out there - I promise. In my work, on a daily basis, I talk to those exact conservatives. &amp; on the whole, they're brilliant &amp; open to compromise. But they're fairly moderately minded and, unfortunately, not passionate enough to take their political thoughts to Twitter.
@darik_kuta @cancunbound2022 @Terrikwv @irishrygirl And I tend to lean left, in some cases, I'm one of those dirty socialists - but, like @darik_kuta (who def isn't a bot, BTW so if people could quit with that that would be great) I believe compromise is the answer. And compromise can't be reached without concessions on each side.
@darik_kuta @mpaula8 @irishrygirl Yeah... What DOES that mean? 	🙃🙃🙃
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl With reasonable policies on legal immigration, I think the wall vs. fence conversation would be very different- and in all likelihood, not necessary.
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl Let me see if I can find some sources regarding paths to legal citizenship in the US. I think upon examining the circuitousness of the process, you may come to agree that entering illegally is only the path of least resistance because the legal path is nearly impossible.
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl But what that brings us to is a conversation about philosophy vs. finance. 		Do we alienate a nation with which we share a border, sending a global message, because it may save $$? Or is that time better spent addressing the reasons people come  here illegally in the first place?
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl Though I certainly agree that more efficient and effective means of achieving legal citizenship should be available - though, arguably, if they were, the wall wouldn't be a conversation we'd be having.
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl Where my belief differs from yours, I think, is that I don't believe a wall, given the context of the discussion that has surrounded it, can be collectively seen as anything other than a means of keeping certain people out. 		And I am not interested in keeping people out.

@johnpavlovitz The idea that they're old enough/responsible enough to own firearms, but not old enough/responsible enough to speak out about what they believe in totally blows my mind.		How is that stance not immensely hypocritical? Regardless what side someone is on... #ParklandStudentsSpeak
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl Ideologically speaking the land of opportunity shouldn't have a wall between it and other parts of the world.		(Plus borders are primarily conceptual, hinging on ownership and "othering.")
@darik_kuta @irishrygirl I'm super anti-wall, but it's ideological rather than being about the $.

Hey @uber - can you create an app ordering system for groceries? Like... I don't want them to take me to the grocery, I want them to bring the groceries to me. 		Specifically, ginger ale, chicken noodle soup, and tylenol. Also chocolate. #sick #heavilymedicated
@GailLuck9 @SaysHummingbird For me personally, when it comes to HUD, Carson knows enough to be dangerous but not enough to be useful. 😂		So, not necessarily a threat. Just not a great choice. 🙃
@GTURN66 I'm going to pretend I didn't read that. I literally just apologized for not clarifying the spending I was referring to. I'm trying to have an actual discussion.		So, to continue that actual discussion, what programs would you prefer to cut into instead?
@GTURN66 @realDonaldTrump I'm not arguing about not having a strong military. We should DEFINITELY have a strong military. 		But "strength" doesn't translate clearly into fiscal terms.
@winetast3r @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I like the liability insurance idea! I hadn't heard that yet. 		And honestly... I think demonstrating knowledge of safety, and competence should be the standard. As well as stringent BCs. But I don't think that makes it harder to get a firearm - they're steps, not barriers.
@GTURN66 That figure includes mandatory spending - I was referring to discretionary spending, which Congress directly defines each fiscal year. 		I didn't make that clear, which was my bad.
@GTURN66 @realDonaldTrump Okay - what's the flaw in my thinking?
@GTURN66 And besides - @realDonaldTrump promotes an "Americe First" approach to military engagement anyway.		Less global involvement should, logically speaking, be less expensive.
@GTURN66 Lol.		Because military spending accounts for over half of our country's expenditures. (54% in 2015)		It's not an ideological statement that I'd recommend diverting military spending, it's literally in the numbers.
@Redge1953Ricky @RealJamesWoods When exactly did I blame the gun?
@swimchick151 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I don't disagree - but that misses the point.
@deepwood4 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Thats literally what you sent me to. 		Thats why im asking what your point was - because I genuinely don’t know how telling me that “unalienable” means “inalienable” proves anything. 🙃 https://t.co/ciw1CBHY7c
@GTURN66 Providing funding = government interference? 🤔
@deepwood4 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods You realize that definition you posted literally said that "unalienable" means "inalienable" - right?
@DarrynistheKing @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Overmedicating is a problem. I think some kids diagnosed with ADHD are understimulated in classes unmatched to their skill level.		That being said, the relationship between mass shootings and psychiatric drug use could simply indicate ineffective mental health care for our youth.
@GTURN66 It can be a response necessity, but it doesn't HAVE to be. Innovation happens because there are great minds in this country (and all over the world). 		But it, unfortunately, does require capital. And if those great minds don't have access to capital, their ideas are just ideas.
@williamlegate I mean... At least it's factual. 😂
@deathurgeover @darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods There's never only one way to solve a problem this complex. There are many potential paths to what everyone wants: safety.
@deathurgeover @darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I agree - I'd love to see the NRA toss some funding at a background check overhaul. (That may already be happening with the NICS Fix but I'm not 100% sure).		&amp; I'm with you - bans aren't necessarily the answer. Would they help? Probably. Are there other ways? Of course.
Financial feasibility is a balancing &amp; prioritizing game.		I'd love to see certain areas of military spending cut, to allow for energy innovation funds.		It's not about "feasibility" - it's about "prioritization". What we as a nation can afford is a choice the legislature makes. https://t.co/LUNqfeT1Ec
@PoliticalEmilia  https://t.co/sNfSEKvB1U
@SaysHummingbird I’m actually shocked he’s stayed in his position this long. 		I expected him to be one of the first to walk. Maybe that’s just me. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@PatriotScoop @mkohlrogge @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods You’re right! Mental health is subjective. Mental illnesses are the most difficult of all diagnoses. 		That being said, there are standardized scales used for many diagnoses that are proven to be effective. 		I’m not saying that would solve the problem. I’m saying it could help.
@deathurgeover @darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I totally agree the system needs an overhaul. You’re totally correct. 		And those who aren’t following appropriate protocol for reporting relevant info should receive sanctioned punishments.
@PatriotScoop @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I totally understand why that would be concerning. TBH I would prefer if there was a system in place to outsource the certification of competency to NRA licensed trainers.		And, there are unfortunately states that don’t require a test to get a CCP. Standardization is necessary.
We don't talk about the connection between "access to firearms” and “suicide” nearly enough. 		And in part, that conversation comes back to affordable, accessible, mental health care in the US, which is a difficult conversation to have.		We can do better. #NeverAgain https://t.co/qz6gwYbIz0
@DonCoglioni45 @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Everyone is allowed to protect themselves - of course. 		But it's also important to recognize that there are other usea for guns than self protection, and there are other ways to protect ourselves as well. 		Being trained will only make people BETTER at protecting themselves.
@Akiva_B_Y @RealJamesWoods I totally agree some states have a functional licensing system for conceal carry - but there are others that don't require training or testing to obtain one. In which case, it's not a function system, unfortunately.
@roblarosa @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Are you telling me you'd go hang out in prison because they've got cable and a nice gym? Lol. 		Have you seen the meals given to inmates? 😂
@sparky08540 @RealJamesWoods Which I'm all about. 		I'd also like them to be trained. So they know how to use those functional, clean guns.
@ROTBre @RealJamesWoods I didn't say you were inflammatory I said your question was.		Of course I'm not pro-genocide. Lol. 		We want the exact same thing. Safety for Americans. https://t.co/b6CzeMnmGw
@EverydayMAGA @mitchellvii I’ll read that. Thanks! 😊		So, what about concerns about funding for research and design of renewable energy tech? Arguably, without R&amp;D, we won't be able to catch up with countries such as China. 😕
@EverydayMAGA @mitchellvii I agree that could/should be part of our approach. 		Plus veggie burritos are great. So. There’s also that.
@ROTBre @RealJamesWoods Of course not. That’s an intentionally inflammatory question and you know it. 		What I’m saying is I would genuinely rather know the citizens protecting me in the case that we needed to “overthrow a tyrannical govt” knew what they were doing.
@EverydayMAGA @mitchellvii Are concerning to me. And I haven't seen evidence of a plan that I feel sets us up for success - but I'd be more than happy to read statements and policies I'm not yet familiar with! (2)
@EverydayMAGA @mitchellvii I mean, I 100% hear you on most of that - especially the meat consumption point. That's also a water issue... And it's all too real. 		Anyway - Do you have resources you could direct me to read regarding Trump's pro-clean-energy policies? Because the cuts to research spending (1)
@ROTBre @RealJamesWoods We know that's going on. In some states there is no training required to obtain CC permits.
@ROTBre @RealJamesWoods So you think it's safe for individuals who have had no training to have, and publicly carry, firearms?
@ROTBre @RealJamesWoods I'm not advocating for only the govt to have guns. I'm advocating for common sense.
@EverydayMAGA @mitchellvii I totally respect &amp; agree with eliminating reliance on other countries for our energy needs- but we should ALSO be working to eliminate our reliance on oil in general. If we continue basing infrastructure on an energy source with an expiration date, we'll be in even more trouble.
@mitchellvii Honestly I'm more concerned with what he hasn't done than with what he has. 		Example: it's dangerous to remain unsupportive of clean energy initiatives, &amp; we are being technologically outpaced by other countries as a result. We should be global leaders, &amp; instead we're behind.
@rfm_al @blirwin @bookishstorytel @cleverchickshop @jlwallen @shannonrwatts @GOP @NRA So if I'm reading this correctly... Your argument is that our "relatively miniscule murder rate" means there's nothing we could be doing better?
That moment when you wish you capped a thread before you got blocked. 😂😂😂
@49erJojo @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Sigh. 		I'm getting super exhausted of repeating over and over that I'm 100% for legal gun ownership, by trained, competent, responsible Americans. 		I should just put that in a note so I can copy it every time someone questions my stance on the 2nd amendment in these threads. 😓
@brucehuntermd1 @AdamJMatlock @Usa1776republic @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods @kittywaymo Honest question. 		Have you actually read this? You've read what I'm saying, and you genuinely think I'm anti second amendment? 🙃
@SnazzyBBQ @BleacherReport h https://t.co/TjZA93E3xI
Why. Are. My. Neighbors. So. Loud. 		Like... Honestly it would be fine if it didn't freak my dog out. 		But is it actually necessary to open the door every ten minutes? There are literally 4 of us in this building.
@DiCam3667Trump @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Definitely not. My answer is to standardize the process for obtaining a gun - and I don't even think that will solve everything. But it could help. 		And it wouldn't cause law abiding owners to suffer - because they're law abiding.		Also abortion has nothing to do with this. 🙃
@DiCam3667Trump @RealJamesWoods Exactly. 		Something they can't do if not properly trained. ☺️
@Sr71u2 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Taxes don't offend me. 		And neither do fees.
@RyanAFournier I personally think all of those entities are at fault. But that's just me.
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Exactly. 		It's not rocket science. It's basic, introductory training. Which is extremely important.
That WAS my response to your "potato potahto" statement.		So let's go back to that, and try again.
@emsphydeaux @RealJamesWoods Trained. 		Ready, and trained. Yes.
I'll try again: 		Are you saying that we should apply, LITERALLY, every concept in a document from 200+ years ago to our current context? 		You realize the bill of rights was an addition, yes? And amendments are added for a reason? To ensure our constitution reflects our context? https://t.co/EjNxZYyA6P
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods 1. Treat all guns as if they're always loaded. 	2. Never point a firearm at anything you are untilling to destroy. 	3. Keep your finger off the trigger until your sights are on target and you've made the decision to shoot. 	4. Be certain of your target, and of what's behind it.
@inhermosa @RealJamesWoods How many criminals who commit mass shootings? Approximately 70% from 1982 to 2018. 		I'm not saying I have a magical solution to all gun violence. I'm saying we could do significantly more to protect ourselves and our fellow Americans. 		https://t.co/uI6KUc4dXa
@Real_ELK @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods You too! 😊
@Spanky5000 @ssholesob @RealJamesWoods Care to tell me WHY you're being so rude? Like... If you disagree with me, that's fine. 		But can you like... Actually express why? Because your insult isn't even accurate. I'm not a Democrat. Lol.
@DEADCLOWN45ACP @RealJamesWoods Okay but isn't that like... Pretty pointless on its own? Like... Without proper training in operations and handling our "militia" ould stand no chance. Right?
@adrew_harding @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods It has nothing to do with "worth". It has to do with your competence to use that firearm safely. 		And again. I am not talking about a random, untrained, govt bureaucrat. I'm talking about a professional instructor, preferably one with an NRA training license.
@Real_ELK @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods If you'd read anything I've said to this point you'd know I'm not interested in preventing you from having a gun - if you're competent, trained, and responsible.
Well, you've answered my "trolling" question, I see. 🙄		Are you just not interested in having a meaningful discussion? https://t.co/nz1t5DLacB
@ssholesob @RealJamesWoods And Las Vegas? 		This isn't JUST about schools. This is a much bigger, more complicated problem.
@DEADCLOWN45ACP @RealJamesWoods Okay, but there are other things required for a militia in "working order."		Like training.
@BillRey50841885 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods *see avitar for facial expression*		You realize that's unconstitutional, right?
@adrew_harding @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods What if that bureaucrat was actually an NRA certified safety instructor...? 		I'm not expecting some random untrained govt employee to have the power to say "yes this person can safely handle a firearm" - that's not what I'm proposing at all. 😊 That would be irresponsible. Lol.
"Snob" is a noun, not an adjective, my friend. 		But you still haven't addressed anything I said with anything more than an ad hominem. Am I going to get a response that uses logic, instead of insults? 		Or are you just trolling? Cuz that's fine too. I'd just like to know. 😒 https://t.co/M6geGNpcve
@adrew_harding @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods In the home I grew up in, there were no firearms. 		Had an armed intruder entered our home with the intention to murder us, they would have likely succeeded. 		But my family CHOSE not to have firearms in the house. I'm not saying one or the other is right. But there is a choice.
@adrew_harding @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Yeah. Exactly. So if you choose to defend yourself with a firearm, you should be trained and prepared to do so. 		Right?
@BCre8F2 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods How is that related to whether or not God wrote the Constitution...? 		Unless you were just trying to be insulting and not actually trying to address my question.
@stoopidmofo @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I personally think months is a bit excessive - but range time supervised by a trained professional is definitely something we should be open to.
@BCre8F2 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods So God wrote the Constitution, then?
Name calling. 		Super mature. I'm impressed. 		Literally nothing you just said at all responded to my questions. 👏🏻 https://t.co/TNdsld2aIZ
@ssholesob @RealJamesWoods Okay so what's your suggestion then?
@enr102562 @RealJamesWoods Totally. I get that. 		To be a regulated militia, what's necessary?
@enr102562 @RealJamesWoods So. In order to be well organized and prepared to fight, what is required?
@merica1966 @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I didn't say they were...? Someone made a comparison and I responded to it.
@SusanKindervat2 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I keep finding myself asking these questions and it's honestly mind blowing. 		You can't legislate behavior? 		Do you know what laws ARE? 	😂😂😂
@WayneJo72052360 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I'm not forcing anything on anyone. 		Are you genuinely concerned that competent trained Americans wouldn't be certified as safe handlers of firearms?
@yeg_sewer_rat @RealJamesWoods I'd be happy to pay taxes that went toward govt funds to ensure my fellow Americans who choose to exercise their 2a rights are properly trained. ☺️
@NickKohlhepp @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods You can say that about anything. 		You could say that about FCC fees or the fees you pay the BMV. Or fees for hunting licenses. Or for any professional licensing. 		CC permits already have widely varying fees associated with them.
@Ncole1111 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I think all gun owners should be able to prove that they can safely operate their weapons. 		One way to do that would be issuing certifications of safe handling and operation following standardized training.
@Delklen @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Woah. Slow down, friend. 		Did you just refer to the founders as God? Or... Are you meaning to say that God wrote the Constitution?
@Delklen @RealJamesWoods Exactly. Training is key. Competency is key.
@deepwood4 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Super cool. Thanks.		But what's your point, exactly?
What basic factual knowledge are you referring to? 		The content of the Constitution and bill of rights? The current regulations that govern the excersizing of our rights? 		Or did you mean the knowledge required to form a grammatically correct sentence? https://t.co/UIFprqmTJA
@LarryFalk @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods How is a certification of safe handling unconstitutional?
@RobertPBrodeur2 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I'm not blaming the gun. 		I'm blaming the systems that allowed that person to obtain one.
@JuanTomas1968 @AverageDave1 Nice ad hominem there. That was great. Super mature. 		It didn't address my argument though. So. Try again?
@BobbyHagstrom @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Arming citizens is great. 		If they know how to safely use theor firearms.
@vinniedog2 @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods No. It's not, actually. 		In some states a license to carry doesn't require testing or training.
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I'm not saying you shouldn't own guns. 		I haven't said that, at all, at any point in any of these threads.
@CherylReynolds Are you legit saying that we should apply, LITERALLY, every concept in a document from 200+ years ago to our current context? 		You realize the bill of rights was an addition, right? And amendments are added for a reason? To ensure our constitution reflects our context?
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Your state isn't every state. You have to go through 8 hours of training in my state as well. 		But:		Again. It's. Not. Standardized. 		Not. Everyone. With. A. Permit. Is. Trained.
@LarryFalk @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods For the millionth time. 		There is already a licensing system in place. If the government wanted to confiscate your guns, the first thing they'd do is go after concealed carry permit holders.
@stoopidmofo @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I'm also not speaking out against the sale of guns...?		I've covered this like a million times at this point. I'm advocating for standardized training.		Like the process to get a driver's license. You know. Where you take a test. And prove your competence.
@AdamJMatlock @JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Do you actually know what my point is, here? Because it doesn't seem that you do.
"If you remove the potential for compromise, you are left with surrender or war." 		We need more of this, and less bipartisanship. https://t.co/dPyd9uM0z3
@Jennpippi @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I'm all about that. 		In the case of health care I'm one of those dirty socialists who believes health Care is a RIGHT not a PRIVILEGE. 		I think the @NRA should address that - I think they should lobby for affordable (mental) health care, if they think that's the root problem.
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods You didn't respond to what I said, at all. 		You can cry personal responsibility as much as you want but we can't remove ourselves from our societal context - and if you kill someone with a gun; yes. You're responsible. 		But the person you killed is still dead.
@Deece16Jeff @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I could get into the socioeconomic constraints applicable to the Chicago example.... Because this isn't simple. 		Everyone wants it to be simple. It's not. 		There is a lot more at play in that example, and in most examples, than "people killing people with guns".
@Deece16Jeff @RealJamesWoods So... Access.
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods That doesn't address my issue at all. 		The right isn't to "own" it. If that were the case, we would have to just give guns to everyone with some kind of magical imaginary government money. https://t.co/AO6qQBvJhf
@mullis_p @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Did that sentence make sense to you when you typed it?
@AdamJMatlock @JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Dude. Can we quit with the "you're changing the argument" nonsense? 		The conversation shifted. That's how talking works.
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods That's literally exactly what I'm saying. 		I'm not suggesting anyone take guns from anyone. That's frankly illogical. Whether I believe we should have guns or not doesn't matter - we have the right to bear arms. 		But NOT everyone with a CC permit is trained.
@WayneJo72052360 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods If they're not the ones who wouldn't be able to show evidence of safe handling competence, why oppose requiring it?
@AdamJMatlock @JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods And they should. National level standardization of licencing would allow that to happen.
@AdamJMatlock @JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods So then my same argument applies. 		What about those who want to take a hunting trip to another state? Shouldn't they be permitted to do so? National standardization OPENS doors, not closes them.
@AdamJMatlock @JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods And honestly I think that's great - but it's still not standardized. 		I know a lot less about hunting licenses than I do about CCW - Are hunting licenses valid throughout the US regardless of the issuing state?
@GarrettLink12 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I totally think we should be enforcing more effectively - but none of our current regulation requires standardized safe handling training before gun ownership or even before licensing to carry.
@JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods The unfortunate thing is right now, there is non-federal standard for safe handling before receiving license to carry. 		I don't know how that applies to hunting licenses though.
@darik_kuta @notwitshurlock @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods "Aptitude verification". I love that phrase.
@houdeenee @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods The misunderstanding is between "restriction" and "standardization". 		Responsible competent citizens have no reason to fear standardization. Left, or right.
@AlvaLyke @mkohlrogge @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods And that's great - but you plan on ensuring that they're able to safely handle those firearms, right?
@God1ssoGood @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Well I mean, it describes your right to "bear arms"... Which is an action... 🙃
@Elminster1981 @darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Exactly. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻		I do NOT want it to be harder for responsible citizens to get firearms.
RT @darik_kuta: @notwitshurlock @YoureSoAwful @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods That is exactly the point. A nationally recognized…
@IslandWolf2 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I didn't say that wouldn't help. 		I think there are tons of cultural shifts that would be beneficial for the overall mental health of American citizens - but working toward culture shift is a lengthy process. 		If that's our only response, we won't act fast enough to save lives.
@AlvaLyke @mtd1302 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods So you'd like to do away with any and all FCC regulation?
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods How do you, personally, define "bear arms"? 		Because "bear" does not mean "own".
@Johnsonjon1972 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods What if we replace the word "licensing" with "certification of safe handling". 		Does that help?
@JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I'm not demonizing the 2a. 		I'm all about the 2a. 		Standardization and training do NOT go against the 2a. 		And I'm not defending teens "right" (which is actually a privilege, BTW) to own/drive vehicles.
@WayneJo72052360 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Saddam Hussein was ridding the world of bad people. 		That's your argument. 		I'm being trolled, right?
@johnnieshaffer @RealJamesWoods Yes. Exactly. 		And arguably, standardized training would ensure the individuals who own guns would actually be useful in the situation that they needed to do such things. 		Not that I think that would happen.
@notwitshurlock @darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods So you're saying any untrained citizen should be able to open carry their firearm with no training? 		Practically speaking, how effective do you think that person would be in an active shooter situation? With no training?
@WayneJo72052360 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Are you suggesting that training people who own guns isn't common sense?
@toomuch2believe @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods And the "it won't solve everything so why implement it" position is frankly not useful, either.
@CherylReynolds Did I say "modernizing"? 		Because I'm pretty sure what I said was "living document theory". 		Ignoring current context and technological advances just makes your position antiquated.
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I mean, we can take this even further if we want to... Like, @AdamJMatlock is arguing it's the STATES' responsibility to decide how (and in the state of California for example, WHETHER) they will uphold FEDERALLY DEFINED rights. Why even have a federal Constitution then?
@AlvaLyke @mtd1302 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Okay so explain the relationship between FCC regulation and the first amendment...?
@AdamJMatlock @AlvaLyke @mkohlrogge @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Dude, same! Who doesn't want free stuff? Lol. 😂		But I'd also want that to be paired with training, and certification of safe handling. 		Does "certification of safe handling" in place of the term "licensing" make my argument clearer to you? Honestly wondering.
@AdamJMatlock @darik_kuta @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods So you're against reciprocity? I shouldn't be able to carry my hypothetical Glock, with my hypothetical Ohio license, in another state? 		So much for "United" states, then.
@AlvaLyke @mkohlrogge @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods 😂😂😂		Please don't make this about capitalism. Everything is already about capitalism. 		The 2a is already out of reach, LEGALLY speaking, for those who can't afford to LEGALLY purchase a firearm. 		Because capitalism. 		Please think before you make erroneous claims.
@ROTBre @RealJamesWoods Yeah...? And...?
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods *wishes I could like this tweet repeatedly*		The states' rights are intended to check the federal govts power - but no one is just a citizen of their state. They're also Americans.
@CherylReynolds 😂 Clever. 		With the "well regulated" comment, I wasn't intending to misalign the original meaning - I was using the "living document" theory and applying the context to today. 		But that's also not the point - I'm not for restriction, I'm for standardization.
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods To vote you already have to be registered - I won't pretend to know how exactly that system works - but realistically, I know diff states have diff standards in that area as well - which isn't fair to anyone either.
@AdamJMatlock @darik_kuta @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Honest question. 		Do you think it's safe and effective for residents in Alabama to be able to receive a CC permit without any training? 		Are you for reciprocity? Do you think gun owners should be able to carry in THE ENTIRE United States?
@MikeALuebeck @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I don't want to make those guns disapear. 		Did I ever say that? That I personally want all guns seized? Because I'm pretty sure I didn't say that.
@AdamJMatlock @darik_kuta @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Dude we elect our federal representatives too - if you voted in 2016, you didn't just vote for the president. You also voted for FEDERAL LEVEL Congress members. 		Representative democracy. That's how it works.
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @notwitshurlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻		Because he doesn't live there he doesn't care. 		His argument is about HIS rights. Not AMERICANS' rights. #hypocrisy right? 😂😂😂
@AdamJMatlock @Oldbopper11 @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Wait, slow down. 		How does the right to "bear arms" "imply" not going out and murdering people? 😂😂😂
@notwitshurlock @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Unlicensed open carry for all. That’s what you suggest. 🤦🏻‍♀️		Do you have any evidence from other countries of that being an effective method to decrease firearm related violence? https://t.co/uuKOO0rxgb
@abecunas @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I agree whole heartedly - in the case that it was nationally implemented, reciprocity wouldn’t be necessary - because the standard training to carry would be uniform. There would be no difference between the training required in Ohio, or Alabama. (States with vastly dif reqs now)
@darik_kuta @RealJamesWoods Honestly I wish there were some kind of statistics to use to measure the impact of the far right/far left quantifiably - because for the most part I agree with you. 		Polarization is never the answer. Compromise is.
@darik_kuta @RealJamesWoods I think the same could be said for the far right. 		The unfortunate thing is those with extreme beliefs tend to be the most passionate about them - and those who are most passionate are most likely to speak.
@AdamJMatlock @Oldbopper11 @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods And the civic duty to vote also implies a civic duty to vote in an INFORMED way. That’s why we’re a representative democracy and not a direct one. The founders feared uninformed voters. 		And free speech protections do not include protection for libel or slander.
@AdamJMatlock @Oldbopper11 @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods “Arms” wasn’t the point of contention. “Bear” was. You’ve conveniently focused on the object instead of the action. 		I think people should be adequately trained to wield a knife as well - if you want to talk about what weapons are. But that’s not the point here.
@Ncole1111 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods What does an old guy with a shot gun have to do with concealed carry permits...?
@darik_kuta @RealJamesWoods YES EXACTLY. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻		"Standardization" and "restriction" are different, and neither side is speaking the others' language. The (moderate) left generally means "licensing standardization" when they say "gun control" but when the right sees that phrase they fear “restriction”
@mkohlrogge @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods That’s a good question. 		I personally think certification by NRA licensed trainers, and certification by a mental health specialist in combination with a background check would effectively evaluate competence.
@mydragonass @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I have never in this entire thread said anything about taking guns from competent trained citizens. I think competent trained citizens should have no problem buying firearms. 		But you and your gun are only useful to protect someone, if you’re trained.
@notwitshurlock @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods So what are you suggesting? Unlicensed open carry for all?
@darik_kuta @RealJamesWoods And this is where I personally think the @NRA, who are frequently described as the “protectors” of 2A rights, should step in and represent their members, and work to implement change to protect our citizenry as a whole. 		We need to be armed. But we need also need to be trained.
@Oldbopper11 @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I mean if we really want to get down to semantics, instead of having a logical, practical conversation, that’s fine. 		But the right is to “bear arms”. Not to “own guns”. I would argue that right extends to the right to know how to safely “bear” the “arms” one owns.
@darik_kuta @RealJamesWoods Thank you for actually paying attention to what I’m saying - You're SO right. 🙏🏻		I'm not anti-gun-ownership at all. 		I’m anti-irresponsibility - and I think if we have a right to own guns then knowing how to operate them safely is merely an extension of that.
@49erJojo @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Okay, like yeah, when you murder someone, they die. 		Shocker. 		But you can't kill someone with a rock from a distance of 450 meters. If the Las Vegas shooter had only had access to rocks, or other close range weaponry, he'd have had a lot harder time killing 58 people.
@mydragonass @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods You can talk about the bill of rights as much as you want to - but categorically speaking there are practical differences between those individual rights that can't be ignored.
@mydragonass @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Words are powerful. One of my degrees is in English and rhetoric. I will never deny that language has immense power. 		But I cannot point a sentence at people in a movie theater and kill them. 		I can, however, point a gun at them and end their lives.
@HAnthonyWalkerI @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Citizens pay for CCW licenses now. So, are you like.... advocating unlicensed open carry nation wide? What's the stance, here? What do you actually want?
@wkinca You realized you responded to my original tweet with a tweet against abortions, but you just now said we're overpopulating. So. 		I'm missing your logic here.
@kungfubarbeque1 @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods I didn't say it didn't. Actually, I specifically gave you a scenario, describing me, in a voting facility. And I specifically said I WASN'T referring to political agency. I.E. the power of your vote to influence people's lives. 		Did you even read my tweet?
@wkinca Training...? Like. You mean sex ed? That would be awesome. Sex ed is super important. 		Unfortunately, much like youth education on firearms operations (which is also super important), has been pushed out of our education system. In this case, primarily by conservatives.
@49erJojo @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Cain didn't have a handgun. So... Yeah.
@marycline52 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Able to purchase firearms. And it, frankly, reflects poorly on the community of gun owning citizens to claim that even those with such a history should be able to own firearms. (2/2)
@marycline52 @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Unfortunately the note about people not getting the help they need, fearing they'll be labeled, is already a huge issue in the mental health community. Mental health stigma is very real - but people with diagnoses and a history of mental health concerns shouldn't be (1/2)
@Mark15King @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods ... You can't put a car in your backpack and take it to school. 		Honestly the fixation on vehicles doesn't help respond to the conversation about effective training and responsible gun ownership. Both unlicensed drivers and untrained gun owners, who kill people, are a problem.
@crisp_aw @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods @NRA I know they do. And I've participated in NRA sponsored programming - but imagine if the NRA offered a training pass to everyone who bought a gun. If they directly took the on the responsibility of ensuring every gun owner was offered free resources - would that decrease deaths?
@kungfubarbeque1 @darik_kuta @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Two things: 		1. There are laws that govern who can and cannot vote in the US. 	2. As much as we can argue about political agency and the power of voting - my vote, directly, in itself, does NOT have the power to kill everyone else in the polling facility with me. 		A gun does.
@law_nra @RealJamesWoods And gun ownership is also potentially, physically dangerous, if people aren't properly trained and educated. 		Tweeting is great, but I can't directly end someone's life with a tweet. Nor can I do so by joining a church. (2/2)
@law_nra @RealJamesWoods To be honest, in my opinion, tweeting or joining a church can't be effective parallels of gun ownership though. 		Licensing for professions like yours are upheld to maintain safety - like, if an unlicensed electrician does work in a home that's potentially very dangerous. (1/2)
@JBradleyBurnett @Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods What I find super convenient is the fact that we have no basis to compare the number of accidents that would occur on the road if we DIDN'T require licensing, and if we DIDN'T invalidate licenses of those proven to be incapable of responsibly driving.
@Mark15King @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods You don't? 		Huh. Weird. I thought your driver's PERMIT was what legally PERMITTED you to drive a car. 		I should have definitely started driving earlier. lol. https://t.co/ijBSrtxQQj
@wkinca I don't know - it's super interesting to me though, that you'd like legislation to control my rights to my body but don't want legislation to control your right to own a gun. 		Really don't know what that had to do with climate change though. https://t.co/draT9JxipE
@wkinca @ProudResister Because NRA members, in my experience, are overwhelmingly responsible. 		What I would love is to see more training. I'd love to see REQUIRED training. And I'd love to see the NRA advocate for that. (2/2)
@wkinca @ProudResister I'm not asking them to stop protecting your right to bear arms. 		I'm all about bearing arms - if you're a responsible, competent, trained, individual. 		I genuinely don't know - have any mass shootings been perpetrated by NRA members? I'd be surprised if they were. (1/2)
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I think that would be fantastic! The more available training is, the better. 		I'd absolutely love to see the NRA put some funding toward sponsoring training programs for new gun owners - because irresponsible owners are what lead to this entire debate. Regardless of their age.
@OpenCarryMag @RealJamesWoods I disagree entirely.		National level licensing, and standardized training could even lead to federally recognized concealed carry (or open carry, as your handle seems to suggest you'd prefer) permits.		I don't want ANY firearms to be confiscated from trained competent owners.
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Without proper handling training, even a responsible citizen with a gun can easily make a life altering mistake. 		If you forget to check your chamber after a few hours at the range, even once, that can legitimately end someone's life. Training is extremely important. (2)
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods That's a good question. 		I think if the 18year old has been trained, professionally, and was certified by a mental health professional, I wouldn't be concerned. If they were a member of the military, I also wouldn't be as fearful of them behaving irresponsibly. (1)
@Chuddox @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Are you like.. trying to tell me things I don't already know?		Do you legitimately think I believe licensing is going to prevent like... Organized crime? Or the sale of guns at shows? Or 3d printed rifles?		Because that's not at all what I'm saying. Even a little.
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Did I say they only impact their own lives? I don't think I said that.		Nope. 		I checked. Looks like in that tweet I was just, uhh... Posing a potential solution. 		I mean, teens aren't the only people killing other Americans with guns either. So.
@Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods And I don't know, maybe.		Honestly I'd be open to lots of options to help with the epidemic of teens dying because they're texting while driving. 		Including potentially increasing the age for issuing licenses. Not that that parallels this situation at all or anything...
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I used DUIs because that's the most common comparison I've been seeing people bring up. 		It's not because of some "narrative". 😂		Government regulation doesn't make me "feel safe". Lol. But neither do 18 year olds with AR-15s.
@darik_kuta @AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods This guy. This guy knows what's up. 		I don't know how I feel about "peer to peer intervention" but all in all yes - national licensing and effective background checks would even make legislation about CCW reciprocity irrelevant, because the licence would be fed. recognized. 👌🏻
@law_nra @RealJamesWoods So... Shoot more guns and shoot more often? 		Sounds like training and practice to me...? Which... Is what I'm advocating for. 		Licensed, trained, competent, responsible gun owners. 		Without that, your "well regulated militia" wouldn't serve its purpose, now, would it?
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods Do you like... Not want gun owners to be trained...? 		Honest question. 		As a responsible adult/American would you REALLY be that affected by the requirement of showing a trainer you know make-safe procedures? Or that you can safely holster/unholstered your weapon?
@Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods In 2015 (latest FBI uniform crime report I could view on my phone) there were 9,616 gun-committed homicides. 		According to the CDC for that same year, 10,265 people died in DUI related crashes. 		87% of elligible Americans have drivers licenses. Only 42% of Americans own guns.
@DeportSquad4859 @DodsonBill @RealJamesWoods Did that intentionally make no sense...? Like... Are firemen the ones preventing government tyrrany now, or something? 		I'm genuinely confused.
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods We would ensure that only those COMPETENT to own a weapon could own one. 		And cars are an illogical comparison. You have to pass tests to get a license to drive a car. As you've so astutely pointed out that's not currently required to own a gun. (2)
@AdamJMatlock @Hunt_A_Lot @RealJamesWoods I didn't say that. 		I said licensed, trained, and competent. 		And I didn't say I was talking about concealed carry in my original comment - you said no one would participate so I used CCW as a parallel concept. 		If in order to own a gun you had to be licensed and trained (1)
@ChristoStad @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods So have you read the rest of the Constitution, or just the second amendment...?
@Hunt_A_Lot @AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods You seem confused, so I'll help. Here. https://t.co/huVE27fvPp
@AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods *literally works with firearms retailers* 		Yes, I do. Which is why I'm questioning why you think licensing won't help. 		I'm not suggesting it'll prevent like... Calculated terrorists from getting licensed and THEN shooting people.		I'm talking about angry 18y.o.s w/rifles.
@DodsonBill @doubtful_1 @RealJamesWoods That's literally their job.
@DodsonBill @doubtful_1 @RealJamesWoods Ever heard of the FCC?
@wendy_nm @RealJamesWoods I'm aware of all that. 		But if the problem is marking yourself for confiscation...? Like. Isn't declaring the intention to carry a firearm literally what you're talking about...?
@DodsonBill @RealJamesWoods Like in all seriousness though are 18 year olds with AR-15s in high schools the image of a "well trained and disciplined" miltia? 		Because I'm pretty sure he wasn't protecting anyone from the government. Just saying.
@DodsonBill @RealJamesWoods Hmmm. I'm looking in this sentence, and uhh... I don't see that in here. Send help? https://t.co/Nit1Ro94wy
@wendy_nm @RealJamesWoods Cuz there were about 15.7 MILLION concealed carry permit holders in the US in mid 2017.
@wendy_nm @RealJamesWoods Ever heard of a concealed carry license...?
@CONSMILITIA @falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods And I'm all about people being armed and trained. 100%. I will probably be a gun owner at some point in my life. 		It's the context of current events that makes this conversation so difficult, because "protection from the govt", and "mass shootings" are vastly different topics.
@CherylReynolds Yup. 		I don't want anyone to take guns from trained, licensed citizens. 		The citizens who would, arguably, be the ones protecting us from those tyrannical politicians.		How is a teenager with a mental illness and an AR-15 going to help "protect" you from our gov., exactly?
@AverageDave1 Oh, so "well-regulated" refers to... 18 year olds who suffer form mental illness purchasing AR-15s legally and running through a high school, huh? 		Sounds like a SUPER well trained, informed, effective militia to me. 		👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods Do you know what licensing is?
@CONSMILITIA @falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods I'm not arguing against any of that, I know what they are. 🤦🏻‍♀️		I was legit just responding to the ridiculous claim that reading the federalist papers would somehow make me re-think what "well-regulated" means. 😂
@CONSMILITIA @zenski5 @rathernotsay @falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods So you get that from the one sentence, then? The single sentence that is the entirety of the 2nd amendment, says that? That's what you're saying? 		Because I don't see those words in there.
@CONSMILITIA @falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods Okay great but dude asked me about the Federalist papers, not about 150+ years of context. 		So.
@zenski5 @rathernotsay @falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods Have you ever looked up the definition of "militia"? Like I get that that's not the point of your tweet but like... https://t.co/mKB9IAQ5Fk
@doubtful_1 @RealJamesWoods And even if you're applying that context to that situation, it still works. 		By ensuring that gun owners are trained and licensed, you ensure that they "know their stuff" - as you said. 		Same concept. Different words.
@AdamJMatlock @RealJamesWoods So any suggestions on how we'll magically rid the world of "bad people"?		I'm really not suggesting we make it harder for citizens to get guns. And in all honesty, I'm also not against the CCW reciprocity bill, either. 		If you're licensed, and competent, and trained, then great.
@falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods Like you do realize the "well-regulated" militia in Fed. Paper 29 was described as being maintained at a state level, right? And that Hamilton ideologically opposed a draft system?
@falafeldiaper1 @RealJamesWoods .... honest question. Have YOU read the federalist papers? Because Hamilton was totes not talking about random Americans with AR-15s. 		And TBH I wasn’t referring to “well regulated” in that context here either - I was more going for the “living document” approach. 🙃
@RealJamesWoods No.		My suggestion would be to take “well regulated” more seriously - with a functional licensing system for gun ownership I think citizens can totally own firearms. 		The vast majority of gun owners aren’t the problem here - regulation and access is the problem.

@CoreyClayton @yendorcire @theadambrister @EWErickson @davidhogg111 I've said all this before:	1. UNDERSTANDING why he didn't engage a mass shooter is different from EXCUSING that choice. 	2.

@CoreyClayton @marcasok @theadambrister @EWErickson @CNN @MSNBC And BTW, "how you get past that" is by being a mature adult. 		Calling the NRA "murderers" isn't super useful either - but that doesn't automatically de-legitimize "those kids'" perspectives. Just like you calling activists "bullies" doesn't automatically de-legitimize yours.
@CoreyClayton @marcasok @theadambrister @EWErickson @CNN @MSNBC So.... basically what you're saying is "they started it" so it's fine. Lol. 😂

@theadambrister @CoreyClayton @EWErickson You realize you're backing up a grown man calling teenagers names, right? LOL. Y'all are ad hominem AF. If you don't agree with him, fantastic.

@Izzy0708 @MarkSimoneNY We should do better. Obviously, like you said, parents have the ultimate responsibility of raising their children. Schools SHOULDN'T be glorified babysitting services.

@Izzy0708 @MarkSimoneNY But TBH it's also not that simple. Claiming that private schools having "less funding" and not having "this problem" are related requires ignoring TONS of socioeconomic factors that lead to mental healthcare access differences between families who can or can't afford private ed.
@Izzy0708 @MarkSimoneNY And that's a great example - but that's very likely not the only donor the school has. Since they're not required to publicize that information, it's impossible to know unless they self-report the per-capita student spending.

@TravisAllen02 I thought they looked ridiculous. But I'm kinda in the same boat. They've grown on me.
@Izzy0708 @MarkSimoneNY There's a difference between "tuition" cost and "per-capita" cost. Private schools in the US aren't required to report their per-capita spending. The amount of independent donation money that contributes to the money ACTUALLY spent on each student isn't taken into account.

@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier You didn't say a metal detector. You said the way our governmental offices are protected. To enter the court house I visited last month, I went through two metal detectors, took off my belt, and had to take a pair of scissors out of my purse and take them back to my car.
@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier 1. Not all cities are your city.	2. I didn't say it's not worth paying for, I asked the more practical question - where does the money come from?	3. Still not the point. I don't care what kind of gun it is if it's pointed at a child trying to get an education.
@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier Dude, we have that. It doesn't prevent media from including violence. Lol. It just lets the public know it's in there. 😂
@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier My "agenda" isn't strictly anti-gun. It's anti-children-being-shot-at-in-a-"free"-country. 		And it's NOT that simple. As I said. 		Who. Is. Funding. That. Level. Of. Security. In. Public. Schools.

@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier Who's funding number 4? And how many hours are added to a school day when 3,000 high schoolers have to have their bags searched before going to homeroom? Ever gone to City Hall on a busy day?
@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier Take for example, number 5. How do you propose we actually reduce violence in media? I'm all about that, but are you suggesting a governmentally set list of standards for appropriate media? How do you regulate that without governmental oversight that conservatives largely oppose?
@nmhunter1 @RyanAFournier That's a great list, and I totally agree with some of those points... The problem is none of those are actually actionable steps, they're  too abstract. And few of them apply specifically enough to the catalysts of these events to actively, quickly reduce the # of mass shootings.
Is that actually supposed to stop them?? 		Their 👏🏻 schools 👏🏻 aren't 👏🏻 safe 👏🏻. 		Go ahead. Suspend them. I'm pretty sure "not getting shot" is higher on their priority list than "not getting suspended". #ParklandStudentsSpeak #GunReformNow https://t.co/PNsPom0koe

@NRA if you genuinely think this is a mental health problem, and you want to both keep your guns, and keep children safe, why don't you lobby for free and equal access to #healthcare for Americans? If that's truly the problem, why not help solve it?
