@PeterTatchell @billybragg @johnpilger @stephenkb @PennyRed @zoesqwilliams @TariqAli_News LGBT ppl are disgusting 🤢 it’s not about freedom, but what those guys do is unbelievable and I’m very thankful that some countries banned them.
@FinancialTimes I believe that proves how much he cares about young Saudis who will lead the country in future. 	he’s planning to make the private sector to invest in local ppl 👍🏼.
@stevenmnuchin1 I’m very glad to see both of you working together to combat the regime of #Iran’s aggressive policies that aim to fund terrorism.

@m3takl_en sexual harassment? what’s your source? please stop your lies and your pathetic attempts to spread fake news.
@PressTV Kushner met #Saudi Crown Prince, and your dictator went to #Syria without your FM @JZarif 😂 what an ironic stories lol.
@amnesty so it’s a family issue, why the amnesty cares about them instead of focusing on Syrians or Iranians who suffer from their regimes??
@ajplus if Houthis didn’t block all those humanitarian aids that sent to Yemenis, we wouldn’t see this starvation crisis.
@HouseofCommons we all hope to see an end to the #Yemen’s civil conflict but Houthis still killing Yemenis and bombing public sites.
RT @mohdsalj: Many countries have contributed financially in #UN YHRP 2019 during #Yemen Pledging Conference in #Geneva to support #Yemen.…
@UN who caused it? Iranian regime and Houthis. 	for what? power, even if it means to kill innocents ppl.
@ICRC they need aids but Houthis used to block every single shipment of humanitarian aids to reach Yemenis.
@UNOCHA I don’t see #Iran who used to call the others to help #Yemen while the regime destroyed the country we donated to.
@Ndawsari and some media tries to fool the world by claiming that #Saudi-led coalition is the one who’s attacking #Yemen
@Jeremy_Hunt I appreciate your efforts to help #Yemen to get out of its crisis but first you need to find a solution to stop the Iranian regime’s interference there.
@Jeremy_Hunt are you going to condemn Iranian regime’s aggressive role in region, and especially in #Yemen??
@Hayder_alKhoei #SaudiArabia spent billions of dollars to secure and build #Yemen, and that doesn’t include the money spent on fighting radical Houthis.

@CNNnewsroom @jimsciutto does that mean you want more wars and conflicts? you don’t care about others, that’s why you seek to destroy any good relationships by your selfish opinions.
@jimsciutto we all know that classified information isn’t something you tell the media about, and what if #Kushner didn’t mention #Khashoggi in his talks??
@KenRoth the #Saudi government is still investigating the case, no one forgot him, so relax and wait till they publish all facts publicly.
@DunyaNews this proves how strong the relationship between the two countries.	#Pakistan considers #saudiarabia as its truly ally in the Arab Gulf which empowers the Islamic countries to fight radical regimes as the Iranian.
@Joyce_Karam what would happen if they announced it yesterday? nothing would change, so why some ppl were upset about it!
@AJEnglish so what? why did you mention the death of Khashoggi now!! what’s your purpose?
@Ilhan @RepEliotEngel and who gave #Hezbollah the weapons they used against other Muslims?? can you just mention the Iranian regime’s negative roles in Middle East!!
@WSJ @wrmead @hrw @KenRoth do your job and stop supporting regimes like #Iran and #Assad.
@WSJ @wrmead if there’re ppl suffering in #China, then where’re your activists and your @hrw?? 		Cc: @KenRoth

@zaidbenjamin do you want #Pakistan to choose a terrorist state like #Iran to be its ally? of course Pakistanis won’t side with the Iranian regime whatsoever.
@PressTV @realDonaldTrump what a pathetic attempts to change the facts. 	they’ll fail as always.
@AshrafGirgis4 @PressTV @UN they’re not criminals, Houthis are. 	besides that the regime of @khamenei_ir is behind every death in #Yemen.
@PressTV @UN thanks to Houthis who created this starvation in order to take control of the country!!	peace cannot be established by violence as Houthis do nowadays.
@BREAKING_PTV @PressTV @HassanRouhani @JZarif shame on you all, this’s the regime we all knew!! I’m surprised that they didn’t get rid of him till now.
@PressTV @khamenei_ir the brutal dictators finally met to put a new plan of how to destroy the world and kill as much as innocents.
@CelineCortez1 @ForeignPolicy it’s for peaceful purposes as #SaudiArabi said, but it’ll try to weaponize it if Iranian regime was able to develop nuclear weapons.
@ForeignPolicy it’s a real opportunity because it’s a peaceful one, not as the same as #Iran is trying to make!!
@RobbieGramer what about Iranian regime? #Hezbollah? do they even in your agendas?
@shanedkavanaugh what did the US senators do when #Iran kidnapped Americans citizens and diplomats? nothing at all. 	but now they got some guts to blame Saudis for their issues.
@shanedkavanaugh he was captured by US police, then they accused #SaudiArabia of helping him to escape!! what a weak story.
@shane_bauer he’s trying to mention #SaudiArabia every time to get some attention to his boring speech. he must NOT do that pathetic attempts.
@CNN he believes in democracy? what a joke. 	why didn’t he say anything about the ppl of #Iran who forced to live under a regime that funding terrorism?
@mitchellreports and when I say traitors, I mean your female agents.
@mitchellreports in every country there’re hundreds of women in prisons and no one ever talked about them, but you focus on #SaudiArabia because you want to save those traitors.
@mitchellreports imprisoning women!!! is that how you see it? she’s already proved herself and showed all of us that #Saudi women can lead the society too.
@joshrogin @DanielCGirard @hiattf weak sarcasm, solving problems cannot be done if we started to make funny of ppl.
@joshrogin @hiattf interfering in others’ affairs and how they work aren’t how #SaudiArabia works!!	#china is a sovereign country and #Saudi crown prince respected that.
@joshrogin @hiattf I don’t see any clown here but you 🤭 #SaudiArabia will never tell any other country what should it do, everything can be done by dialogue and discussion.
@LotteLeicht1 if you’re willing to defend traitors then you’re not much different from them!! keep your nose out of it and focus on how to help poor Iranians who’re living under the regime’s control.
@LotteLeicht1 who the heck are you to tell #SaudiArabia what to do? the #Saudi government will not accept to be guided by others.

@CNNPolitics a huge move for #Saudis, which reflects their desire to change 👍🏼.
@AFP @SatishCheney what about Syrians who fled to European countries and were banned from entering? don’t they deserve your attention??
@a_leesha1 starvation started when Houthis stole and blocked humanitarian aids and food that were suppose to reach Yemenis.
@CNN where are those who claimed #SaudiArabia doesn’t give women their rights?
@KenRoth this pic tells us a lot. https://t.co/VdVFvuQVvJ
@KenRoth of course I believe that because you &amp; your likes want the world to believe your lies and rumors.
@ForeignPolicy in fact, Houthis forces have been accused of stealing humanitarian aids &amp; medical supplies, plus they used to recruit children to fight in battlefield instead of them.
@sunnyjim4 @KenRoth how come they become dictators, in your point of view, while all saudis are respecting them!! that doesn’t make any sense.
@KenRoth your job is to defend human rights, not to attack governments, look at Iranian or Assad regimes!! they’re torturing their own people with no mercy and you stand there doing nothing.
@KenRoth you’ll never agree with #SaudiArabia whatever they do, that shows how much you hate them and you’re taking it personally!!
@RandPaul #Germany made a horrible mistake by stopping arms sales to #SaudiArabia, they made a rush decision that they’ll regret one day.
@RandPaul and you should join your administration’s decision to cut your ties with Iranian regime.
@RepLloydDoggett @RonWyden and I’m pretty sure #SaudiArabia will be happy to help if you provide evidence that supports your accusations.
@RepLloydDoggett @RonWyden if they escaped from your observation, it’s your own fault and do not try to blame others for your mistakes.
@birdyluisa @yashar @ImranKhanPTI there’s a long history between the two countries, and they seek to strengthen it with their cooperation and agreements.
@yashar @ImranKhanPTI and #Pakistan is fully aware of this fact, but #Saudi Crown Prince has ordered to let them go free regarding his current visit.
@yashar @ImranKhanPTI they’re being treated well, but some of them committed some crimes and violated the laws, it’s normal to find some of them in jails.
@MinhazMerchant maybe in coming future #Pakistan &amp; #India become great partners of #SaudiArabia in many fields, but now they need to focus on combating terrorism as the Iranian regime.
@ImranKhanPTI he asked to consider him as their own ambassador to his country, what a great guy.
@ImranKhanPTI this’s the real leader we all admire, he proves that he’ll change the world to a better place and create a bright future for all of us.
@poddar_shashank @Chellaney here’s the proof you asked for my friend. https://t.co/iGcTXUnGmw
@PressTV I wish Iranians take down your brutal regime for once and all, the people had suffered enough to survive your regime’s suppression.
@PressTV look how desperate you are now 😄 my advice to you is to rethink about your relationship with terrorism.
@PressTV you mean Houthis’ fire? of course they did launch that cowardly attack which proves you cannot keep your nose out of #Yemen
@PressTV does that scare you guys? declare peace and stop your funding for terrorism then may be @realDonaldTrump will forgive you.
@PressTV they could live peacefully if the regime has stopped its aggressive behaviors in the region and give the Iranians their freedom.
@TheEconomist #Iran must stop its dangerous activities or the world will suffer again!! peace is our dream and we can’t achieve it while the Iranian regime plays dirty.
@poddar_shashank @Chellaney do you have any proof that he ordered to kill Khashoggi? I’m pretty sure you’ve none.
@Chellaney and your accusations are meaningless!! you totally ignored what Iranian regime’s actions in Middle East.
@Chellaney it’s the common misunderstanding we face everyday, both countries are trying to fight terrorism and cut its funds, you cannot blame them for Al Qaeda’s operations because they also were target.

@SenatorShaheen then you should call the Iranian regime to stop their interference in #Yemen and cut their support for Houthis if we seek to the stability there.
@SenatorShaheen @SenToddYoung @POTUS the ones who violated the ceasefire agreements are the Houthis and their ally, the Iranian regime. 	the coalition tried to determine their threats as they can but the militants targeted the civilians directly.
@ChrisMurphyCT the real problem there is the Iranian regime’s interfering in #Yemen’s affairs!! don’t try to change the main issue that we all faced there.
@cenkuygur @RoKhanna no senator has fight for Yemenis in their conflict against Iranian regime, in fact all senators stood in the regime’s side.
@TulsiPress that’s why Houthis militants did steal the food and the humanitarian aids &amp; supplies to create the worse starvation in history!!
@TulsiPress who was targeting the children and the civilians in #Yemen are Houthis and the Iranian regime’s agents, they tried to take down the legitimate forces in order to control the country.
@TulsiPress which mean the US’s support was necessary at that time to save #Yemen and its ppl.
@TulsiPress the Yemeni legitimate government itself asked #SaudiArabia and others to help the country to stop the Houthis’ attempts to invade #Yemen &gt;&gt;

@NegarMortazavi @washingtonpost that doesn’t the fact that #Iranian regime is responsible for every single chaos in Middle East!! if you disagree that then you’re not different from them.
@RoKhanna Houthis stole the weapons from Yemeni army, then they sold them to radical people who used them to attack the civilians. 		you didn’t support #Yemen’s government, then don’t blame others of your failure.
@BillKristol @AdelAljubeir was so clear in his statement, be patient and wait for the investigation’s results.

@NickKristof you’re so funny dude 😃 Nobel Peace Prize for someone who betrayed her country and its people? she didn’t care about women’s rights, she aimed to destabilize the society from the beginning.
@PressTVPrograms you can return your relationship with the United States quickly, just stop funding terrorism and hosting radical people, leave the world to live peacefully and you can survive the sanctions.
@HLaverdiereNPD @FreeLoujain peaceful activism!!! do you consider her actions as a peaceful ones? she’s being accused of serious crimes that includes the security of #SaudiArabia, so please stop making her as a hero while she’s not.
@CNNnewsroom @ChrisMurphyCT Houthis didn’t stop their attacks on civilians or #SaudiArabia’s territories since the civil war started, they didn’t respect the agreements or keep their promises.
@CNNnewsroom @ChrisMurphyCT #Iran has been delivering weapons and arms to radical groups in the region and specifically the #Taliban, and as a result they attacked your country in 9/11
@CNNnewsroom @ChrisMurphyCT did he mention the weapons that were smuggled to Houthis militants by Iranian regime? or he said what the regime wants??
@SenBlumenthal okey then what?? how can you stop Houthis and Iranian regime from causing more damages in #Yemen? do you really want to pull off your troops to let the radical people control the country?
@RepRoKhanna @SenSanders @ChrisMurphyCT any plans to take #Iran out of #Yemen? or you don’t care about Iranian regime’s present there!!
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenSanders @SenMikeLee @RepRoKhanna @RepJayapal and you’re not upset about Iranian regime’s involvement in #Yemen at all, or about its roles there in worsen the conflict there.
@Dr_E_Kendall it’s gonna collapse because Houthis didn’t stop its attacks on civilians or public areas. 		but as long as you made your interview on @AJEnglish, you’ll defend Houthis and blame others.
@hrw is that what concerns you more that focusing on Iranian regime’s threats? is that  the way how you guys do your job??	shame on you @hrw
@astroehlein #Saudi women can get their passport without male guardianship + they’ve the full right to decide whatever they want regarding medical conditions.
@Ilhan + United States didn’t ban all Yemenis from entering its borders, it put some restrictions on their procedures for entering. 	it’s its right to protect its security from strangers.
@Ilhan you’re totally wrong!! the war in #Yemen isn’t against the people, it’s against Houthis militants who tried to destroy the country and turned it to ashes.
@RepRoKhanna when will you introduce a resolution to stop Iranian regime from interfering in #Yemen’s affairs and withdraw from there??
@RepRoKhanna I agree with you, Yemeni people cannot wait to see the country free of Houthis forces and Iranian regime’s agents.
@codepink @MariahCarey can you hear yourselves? your false calls aren’t gonna change the fact that #SaudiArabia is changing right now. 	you’re afraid of this change because it’s not helping you guys.
@nytopinion @NickKristof those organizations who she worked for are politicizing her case in order to protect their interests. 	you @nytimes is playing part of their dirty game, you sold your credibility unfortunately.
@nytopinion @NickKristof I agree that she campaigned for allowing women to drive, but the reason why she’s arrested isn’t related to that. 	she contacted foreign organizations that seek to harm the #Saudi’s society and security.
@amyklobuchar women are allowed to drive nowadays, and her case isn’t about driving cars at all, her case is related to security issues and everyone is aware of this matter.
@BuzzFeedNews so why media said they’re murdered? why media blamed #Saudi government for their death? are they going now to apologize for their false accusations?
@RoKhanna I really don’t know what’s your problem with #SaudiArabia, but that doesn’t give you the right to manipulating us and accusing others of Houthis’ actions.
@RoKhanna wrong wrong wrong!! you’re misleading the people on purpose you Senator. Houthis are the ones who prevent the supplies to reach the people in need.
@MOTRPolitics1 @NBCNews who’s this Mohammed bin Sultan 😄 Crown Prince of what country?
@NBCNews so it’s a suicide!! then why some media accused and blamed their family of their death? now the truth have shown up that media is spreading fake news.
@zaidbenjamin of course #SaudiArabia will support #Lebanon because its stability is necessary to combat terrorism in region, and that includes fighting #Hezbollah and its likes.

@SenSanders torturing &amp; imprisoning activists? like who? all I know is that #Saudi government has captured some people used human rights activities as a cover to hide their real agendas.
@ChrisMurphyCT all those bad things happened because of the Iranian regime, the regime supported every terrorist group we know, funded every terrorist operation we witnessed. 	#Iran is the main source of destruction.
@lloyd_rm UN reports aren’t 100% true, #Saudi-led coalition is NOT targeting civilians in #Yemen, Houthis are doing that.

@NatashaFatah @rahaf84427714 @rahaf84427714 claims that her family threaten her to death, but we didn’t hear their side of the story. 	what’ll Canada do if it discovers that she was lying the whole time!!
@NatashaFatah @rahaf84427714 #Canada tries to make itself the best place to host ppl in need while it turned its back on poor Syrians who were killed by #Assad regime.
@sam_vinograd @CNN who’s the murder here exactly 😄?
@CNN #Khashoggi death has been politicized by some countries who wish to destabilize #SaudiArabia internationally, but their agendas failed.
@CNN it’s normal to discuss the latest updates of any affair that concerns him, but for sure @SecPompeo is a professional man and won’t interfere in those cases.
@LotteLeicht1 if you mean the people responsible for #Khashoggi death, be sure that the #Saudi government is seeking to reveal the truth and hold the killers accountable for their crime.
@c_kennaugh @alfonslopeztena she wasn’t so clear about her condition, she accused her family of abusing her but no one heard their side of the story.
@alfonslopeztena second, those activists should be ashamed of themselves for using a young lady as their tool to create a show that serve their agendas, it’s a crime.
@alfonslopeztena first, she wasn’t trying to escape Saudi Arabia, she claimed that she ran away from her family which we didn’t hear the full story till now.
@NatashaFatah @Omaima don’t you see that you’re interfering in Saudi Arabia’s internal affairs?? some people are using the male guardianship as a subject to destabilize the society of #SaudiArabia

@KenRoth because #Canada is hosting people who serve its agendas to harm #SaudiArabia, and Rahaf if one of them.
@miss9afi @freefromhijab it’s not your business to tell ppl what to wear and take off.
@miss9afi @freefromhijab weren’t you worrying about your husband? are you using your followers to cause troubles in other societies?
@SecPompeo will other countries like #Qatar cooperate with the rest of the world to stop the Iranian regime’s threats and help to restore stability in the region?
RT @SecPompeo: Nations are rallying to confront #Iran’s revolutionary agenda like never before: Cutting Iran’s oil imports to zero, thwarti…
@SecPompeo Iranian regime is the main source of those radical islamists’ funding. 	stopping the regime means stopping the threats we face everyday from terrorists.
@SecPompeo finish the Iranian regime who funding those radical terrorists and then you can eliminate all the rest easily and quickly.
@JZarif @SecPompeo since Iranian regime started interfering in others’ affairs, chaos happened, destabilization caused. 	don’t try to blame the United States of your regime’s behaviors are actions.
@JZarif @SecPompeo whenever/ wherever #Iran interferes, chaos, repression, and resentment follow &gt;&gt; it should be written in this way.
@SecPompeo the regime needs to be stopped and punished for its crimes against humanity, I cannot believe that the rest of the world still silent on Iranian regime’s actions.
@JZarif really? so you accuse others of harboring terrorists?? okey then the radical people that your regime’s harboring what do you call them?
@KarenAttiah investigation is not done yet, and the case is an internal one, there’s no third party here.
@KenRoth he was joking and the interpreter laughed, don’t try to change the subject here. 	your target is the male guardianship, there’re thousands of women live under this system and how many of them complained? only few without real cases.
@khamenei_ir you should be ashamed of yourself and your regime’s behaviors. just quit your operations and leave the world live peacefully.
@khamenei_ir look who’s talking about being reliable and trusted 😄🤥 you didn’t keep your promises in cutting your support for terrorism, or to stop the ballistic missiles tests.
@khamenei_ir you mean your defeat will be unprecedented!! if you really care about your country’s &amp; people’s future, you wouldn’t support terrorism and conflicts in region.
@khamenei_ir I don’t think your regime will endure those sanctions for a long time, Iranians deserve better than serving your radical regime.
@khamenei_ir your defensive capabilities are weak for sure, you cannot launch a direct war against your enemy, that’s why your regime depend on proxy wars.
@miss9afi he didn’t only express his own opinions, he actually called the people to do the same and to go against the government.

@abcnews @monaeltahawy @LindaMottram Male Guardianship isn’t relevant to her case if she was abused by her family as she claimed, there’re millions of Saudi women who live their lives freely and normally under the Guardianship you talk about.
@abcnews @monaeltahawy @LindaMottram you said that her father is a powerful man, so who’s he? your article doesn’t say anything about him at all.
@sploach @cnni #Thailand said they may return her to her family who lives in #Kuwait, no one mentioned #SaudiaArabia or MBS
@ishagshafeeg @cnni we don’t know the truth yet, but at the end they’re her family members and we need to help them to get together not to separate them.
@cnni they should do their part and make the family settle their differences together, try not to make the case go publicly because media may ruin their relationship.
@KenRoth she’ll go back to #Kuwait, not #SaudiaArabia so don’t try to blame Saudi government for that because the #Saudi embassy will take a good care of her and start an investigation to reveal the truth of her claims.
@KenRoth Male Guardianship has nothing to do with her return home, according to #Thailand she has no right to enter the country or stay there.
@KenRoth no one can harm her as long as she reports that to the authority with evidence, otherwise I guess she lies.
@KenRoth he must be insane!  how dare him to ask help to rebuild #Syria where he keeps destroying the country and killing its people??
@TheRealRiese @cnni is that a joke? it’s not funny at all my dear 😪. 	you’ll be surprised if you know what #Saudi women have.
@melissa_dinolfo @cnni nope, but the case here is some women don’t know about their current status which’s not fair at all, the new method will make sure that everyone will be fully aware of their owns.
@cnni I guess not all countries have reached the level of using technology to help people, saudis did a good job by developing their country.
@LotteLeicht1 #Saudi women have their rights and so happy about the reforms that they whiteness in their country.
@LotteLeicht1 Male Guardianship is something you’ll never change it because it is exist in #islam. 	no one has came to you and complained about it.
@LotteLeicht1 she was in #Kuwait my dear, not in #SaudiArabia. 	you need to read before tweeting about the case.
@TarekFatah @hrw @rahaf84427714 @hrw urges #Thailand to not to do their job? what’s their excuse? nothing, they just heard a rumor from the media and believed it without looking for the truth.
@KermitThinker @KenRoth @60Minutes this’s the problem we see most of the time, when we ask someone about something and we didn’t like the answer, we keep asking the same one until we get the answer we’re looking for.
@60Minutes #Egypt is one of the most countries that suffered from radical people and terrorist attacks that costed many live of innocents people, so please cut it off and be responsible.
@60Minutes did you just accuse president of #Egypt of committing a massacre? is that your thoughts about Arab countries? the stereotype that you have about #Arabs is totally wrong.
@KenRoth has been showered by #Qatari money, that’s why he accused @realDonaldTrump of being showered by money from #SaudiArabia 		pathetic response. https://t.co/kFTDyY6CQ7
@KenRoth @realDonaldTrump has no time for his own business, he WAS a businessman but now he IS the president of the United States. 	he has a lot of important things to deal with and you just accuse him because he’s not serving your agendas.
@KenRoth @60Minutes he just silenced those who supported the #MuslimBrotherhood in #Egypt. for me he did a good job because those radical people were planning to take the country to the bottom.
@KenRoth @60Minutes the interviewer was trying to make him get angry and pushing him to his limit by repeating the question like he’s hiding the truth. 	I do like the program but recently it started to serve its own agendas.
@trinityaryajoan @KenRoth she doesn’t need asylum, she can report to her country’s authority if she was telling the truth and they will help her.
@wheretonow2015 @KenRoth @jennineak why did she traveled to another country? if she was abused, she could report that easily in #Kuwait where her family lives.
@KenRoth she’s not abused by her family as they said, you don’t know the truth about her escape from her family. 	if she planned to go to #Australia, she wouldn’t go to #Thailand in the first place.
@PressTVPrograms #UN didn’t say that, it’s just some people who gave that statement because they know that #SaudiArabia isn’t involved in that murder but they want to blame Saudis.
@PressTVPrograms you created a video by using those who are against #SaudiArabia’s successful policies because the new #Saudi is not allowing your regime to carry on its radical actions.
@kumar_vineeet @TulsiGabbard US Secretary of State @SecPompeo has said that over and over again, #Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world.
@TulsiGabbard your enemies are Houthis &amp; Iranian regime, those are the ones who you need to stop in order to restore peace in #Yemen
@TulsiGabbard their agendas are making the situation in #Yemen more difficult than it is now, you’re blaming the wrong party here.
@TulsiGabbard starvation &amp; cholera have been caused by Houthis militants who blocked every single way to deliver the humanitarian aids, they also stole all food and medicines.
@TulsiGabbard you’ve been mislead by media, #SaudiArabia isn’t targeting Yemeni people as you mentioned, in fact it is protecting &amp; helping them by various means.
@RealSaavedra what I’ve heard is that she’s financed by #Qatar government who supports the radical Muslim Hrotherhood group.

@AJENews the case will not be an international case whatever you say or do, so save your efforts.
@burayw0a @cnni he said they’re not allowed to attend matches in #Saudi Arabia, where actually they can attend all matches there.

@cnni what’s the relationship between the two teams’ playing and the female fans’ appearance?
@UNGeneva @UNHumanRights #Saudi individuals killed a Saudi citizen inside a Saudi consulate, there’s no need for international investigation at all unless human rights activists have something to hide.
@UNGeneva @UNHumanRights she called for justice while the case is being investigated by #Saudi government, I don’t know what justice she meant!!
@RoKhanna those countries have a good relationship with #Iran, who #SaudiArabia buys the arms to protect itself against it, and both US and KSA are considering Iranian regime as their common enemy.
@mehdirhasan @hasanminhaj literally accused #SaudiArabia for killing innocents people, that’s not acceptable at all. 	only those who got paid by #Qatar believe that lie.
@Baluyues @nytimes there’re hundreds of people entering each #Saudi consulates around the world daily, did they all get killed? please stop you’re not funny at all.
@nytimes so you admitted that the episode was aiming to criticize #SaudiArabia’s Crown Prince? is that your objectives? to make humanitarian cases as jokes?
@KenRoth @netflix #Yemen tragedy isn’t a subject to handle it in your jokes on tv or to make some sarcastic comments about it.

@KenRoth there’re thousands of people surviving their lives in #Yemen because of Houthis’s latest move in stealing and blocking humanitarian aids, and all what you care about is ONE dead journalist???
@KenRoth how do you know that those black bags contain #Khashoggi’s body parts? did your intelligence tell you that? or you’re just guessing as always and claiming fake things?
@ChrisMurphyCT if you trust @washingtonpost this much, then why didn’t they mention Houthis’ role in #Yemen disaster? why they blame #SaudiArabia only?
@ChrisMurphyCT and you don’t accept the idea of fighting a terrorist state like Iranian regime? please either you keep quit or support @realDonaldTrump to eliminate all threats that will harm us.
@ChrisMurphyCT so you still protecting Iranian regime at the expense of regional security? wow you really don’t care about restoring peace in region at all.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I don’t think Iranian regime will withdraw from #Syria so easily, they want to make a present for them there. 		@realDonaldTrump needs to take a serious move to ensure #Syria is safe place for civilians.
@khamenei_ir they failed because your regime has raised #ISIS and funded other terrorists in Middle East, your radical policies are targeting our safety.
@khamenei_ir your ideology won’t help us to restore peace and stability, in fact it’ll destroy us and our future as long as the likes of you are existing.
@AJENews on the other hand, if you want to help to reach the truth, call #Turkey to deliver all evidence it has to #SaudiArabia. 		it’s totally wrong to hide the evidence that we hear about from the media.
@AJENews you still talking about that 🤣 come on guys the incident has reached the office of the #Saudi general prosecutor, don’t worry they know how to do their job.
@Badbeat29 @BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump did #Saudi pay him to build his wall? nonsense
@BrianKarem @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump has a point, if the wall was existing, we wouldn’t see this huge numbers of immigrants who entered the country illegally. 	#Khashoggi case is totally different.
@PKraehenbuehl @UNRWA @KSRelief_EN #SaudiArabia is doing its part towards people in needs to restore stability and security in region. 	I wish others like Qatar used its money to help ppl, not to destroy peace.
@HillelNeuer at least #SaudiArabia helped Palestinians and Yemenis, it did follow #Iran or #Qatar to host terrorists and fund their operations.
@colher23 @TarekFatah @BernieSanders of course they’ll keep silent on Iranian regime’s roles in #Yemen because that serve their purpose and interests in Middle East.
@TarekFatah @BernieSanders so you ran out of new ideas and re-posting an old tweet? can’t you think of anything based on truth at least?
@hisham_melhem but you’ve no proof that supports your alleged accusation!! talking is easy, but proving that is so hard. 	that’s why at this time we cannot believe that media unless they provide evidence.
@DailySabah I’m so glad to see Iranian women get their rights and play football under their regime. 	they deserve to live freely and practice their hobbies.
@DailySabah you said that #Turkey’s Foreign Ministry didn’t elaborate on the content of the discussion, then how did you know that they talked about #Khashoggi case?
they still insist that @AdelAljubeir is the former FM of #SaudiArabia 😂😆 they didn’t realize that he’s still leading the #Saudi foreign affairs. https://t.co/1xgew7ppi0
@RoKhanna if you’re willing to stand up for human rights, then why didn’t you stand up for poor Iranians who’re imprisoned because they dreamt of peace!!
@KenRoth @nytimes &amp; @washingtonpost are spreading lies and fake stories about regional events, we should NOT allow them to lie to us anymore.
@KenRoth you’re the expert here in closing the eyes for crimes like Iranian regime’s operations in #Yemen and other places. 	it’s a shame to be paid by #Qatar and accuse @realDonaldTrump for such a thing.
@MazMHussain they’re not trolls as you said, they’re experts who work to expose the radical actions of terrorists. 	their outcomes are in the world’s benefit as well.
@MazMHussain that proves #SaudiArabia doesn’t have anything to hide, on #RiyadhSummit in 2017, it launched the Global Center for Combating Extremism Ideology in front of the whole world.
@KarenAttiah #SaudiArabia didn’t recruit them, so why should US punish Saudis for that?
@nytimes you’ve reached your deepest level of disgusting, I can’t believe how much you’ve become pathetic to spread lies in your newspaper!!
@NYTimesAtWar #Sudan’s policy to join the army is so clear, so if you’ve any problem talk to Sudanese president, don’t blame the coalition.
@SenBlumenthal they’re not recruited by #SaudiArabia or any other nation, but their own country. 	so please read and search before you believe any report.
@SenBlumenthal sorry for saying this but you’re an idiot. 	those are members of #Sudan army, and since Sudan is part of the coalition, it sent its army to #Yemen.
@HelenClarkNZ do you know that Houthis used to recruit Yemeni children and put them in front lines since the civil conflict started?
@HelenClarkNZ #Sudan is responsible for the safety of its soldiers whether they are young or adults, and if they signed to join the army voluntarily, then we can’t do anything about it.
@KarenAttiah he doesn’t need to buy a reputation for himself, because his efforts are fully appreciated by world leaders.

@RichardHaass BTW, Houthis used to recruit children and used them to deliver bombs and suicidal attacks.
@RichardHaass calm down my friend, Sudan’s army policies are allowing any member to join the force as long as they above 18, so #SaudiArabia isn’t recruiting any boys in its army.

@PressTV and I guess the first leader of so-called Islamic State is @HassanRouhani, this shows how much Iranian regime is supporting #Assad regime that killed thousands of people.
@PressTV @UN liars!! #Saudi-led coalition is committed to the ceasefire agreement and didn’t launch any air strikes since they agreed.
@PressTV your news and sources cannot be trusted, you should focus on Houthis’ attacks on innocents Yemenis.
@KenRoth @hrw if you report the truth as you say, then tell me why I don’t see you condemning Iranian regime for torturing &amp; killing innocents?
@KenRoth @hrw yeah of course, I almost got to believe you 😪 @hrw was one of the honest organizations around the world, but now since the Arab spring started, you lost your credibility and our trust.
@clydesconnect @RoKhanna @KatrinaNation which American?
@RoKhanna if you really care about Yemenis and their access to food and medical supplies, you’d have figured out a way to stop the Iranian regime from interfering in #Yemen.
@SenWarren do you have any desire to know Iranian regime’s role in #Yemen? about their opinions there?
@SenWarren that’s your lifetime problem, you believe every single report you see on media that supports your opinions instead of trusting your government.
@KarenAttiah @Abdulkhaleq_UAE @washingtonpost your problem is with #SaudiArabia, you don’t care about #Khashoggi or (journalist being killed), so just stop your activities and direct them to the detained people in #Iran
@tparsi @KarenAttiah actually your only problem is with al saud family, you hate them and prefer to see a protest there because it helps your Qatar-backed agendas.
@KarenAttiah which also assure us that #SaudiArabia is doing everything to achieve its vision 2030.
@KarenAttiah if the king was trying to clean up his son’s mess, then why didn’t he remove him? that’s mean crown prince #MBS had nothing to do with #Khashoggi death as you said.

@AJEnglish it’s pathetic how you guys try to make him look like a victim and he didn’t do his job in the right way but be sure he’s giving a better position and will lead the #Saudi’s foreign affairs as always.
@AJEnglish unfortunately either you missed it or trying to manipulate your own ppl, @AdelAljubeir is still driving the diplomatic talks and dealing with political affairs as always.
@miss9afi @realDonaldTrump do you want @realDonaldTrump to interfere in some country’s internal affair? of course it won’t happen at all. 		talk to #SaudiArabia instead of talking to its enemies like your husband did.
@doodlebug0 @Newsweek so #Iran isn’t part of your axis of evil? #Hezbollah?
@Newsweek no one can actually, there’s no need to give a statement to US because @realDonaldTrump administration is fully aware of that, but the problem is with US senators who get money to attack #SaudiArabia
@abdelbariatwan @raialyoum1 @AdelAljubeir wasn’t sacked!! #Saudi government create a new position for him to focus on foreign and diplomatic affairs, if you paid more attention to that you’ll realize it.
@abdelbariatwan @raialyoum1 the changes are necessary according to the #Saudi government to achieve all goals and establish stability. 	@AdelAljubeir was promoted to a better position as Minister of State for foreign affairs and believe me he’s the best suitable man for this position.
@rulajebreal is that bothering you 😄 I guess those royal decrees have ruined some of your future plans.
@anla500 @BBCWorld guess what, @AdelAljubeir will be the state minister of foreign affairs which means he’ll keep dealing with the world regarding foreign policies and affairs. 	too bad news for you.
@abubexx @AJENews remaining of crown prince will get stability in home and give the ppl the confidence they need to move the country into a new level of development.
@AJENews and become the state minister of foreign affairs 😏 now he’ll be focusing on foreign affairs and those fake media like you guys.
@tictoc this’s the freedom of expression that @RT_Erdogan was calling for months ago. 		what a hypocritical guy.
@BBCWorld and that doesn’t include any matter related to embassies or diplomatic activities.
@BBCWorld you’re trying to make him look like a scapegoat for #SaudiArabia, but you guys are getting it wrong. 	he’s named as state minister of foreign affairs which means he’ll focus on foreign affairs only.
@PressTV to return to #Assad regime’s control?        NO WAY!!!	we can’t allow the regime to get its dirty hands on the eastern #Syria, US should keep its forces there.
@Mounirarab97 @HillelNeuer @Ostrov_A @HRCSaudi @UNHumanRights Iranian regime!! of course it is. 	I don’t think there’s a human rights commission in #Iran.
@just_whatever @HillelNeuer @HRCSaudi @UNHumanRights nope, it’s an official #Saudi Twitter account and achieve the same principles and standards of the international human rights laws.
@HillelNeuer @HRCSaudi @UNHumanRights trust me, your view of human rights are totally different from the world’s view, yours don’t apply on Iranian regime’s actions toward Iranians or Yemenis.
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow we know the truth and we know that the #Saudis are taking the case seriously and looking for the truth and they eventually will provide us with the results.
@CheriJacobus @highbrow_nobrow such a good liar 🤥😆 we’d enough of fake reports and tweets about #Khashoggi tragedy, we all sorry for what happened to him and the big mistake of those individuals’ decision, but you guys need to stop lying to us.
@SandraH26502320 @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump I’m following every updates but don’t forget that your administration has denied any involvement of #Saudi government in #Khashoggi death, which’s the same administration that heard those audio tapes.
@gratifymenow @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump of course we aren’t stupid and know how this world works, that’s why you need to see the picture from another angle, see who’ll gain from ruin the relationship between US &amp; #Saudis
@gratifymenow @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump Iranian regime has kidnapped some American diplomats in US embassy for more than 400 days, does that mean US administration,back then, was cooperating with the terrorists?
@NNABResearch @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump I wasn’t asking for your opinion my dear, it’s up to you if you want to believe it or to prove the opposite.
@dremy2 @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is a billionaire who doesn’t need more money or to be controlled like an idiot, so basically your argument isn’t as good as you think.
@rjleedesign @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump so you want a brutal dictator to rule a broken country like #Syria? you cheer for someone who used chemical weapons against his own people and killed them?

@Peachyfruitcake @rjleedesign @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump after #Saddam death, Iranian regime used that opportunity to extend their influence in #Iraq, and as a result we witnessed the raise of #ISIS
@rjleedesign @babacar14 @realDonaldTrump Syrians have the right to choose their president, who’ll take a good care of them and restore peace and stability.
@KarenAttiah @washingtonpost no he meant the #SaudiArabia that rebuilding countries, supporting others, and do whatever it takes to bring stability to the region.
@AJENews #Saudi Arabia will do its duties toward its neighbors, but the question is: will #Qatar do the same and invest its money to rebuild #Syria instead of funding terrorism??
@zaidbenjamin media likes to talk about #SaudiArabia even if they brought up old stories that aren’t relevant to current situations.
@Rikunda @realDonaldTrump #Iran did and US intelligence has evidence proves that those terrorists were trained &amp; funded by Iranian regime.
@babacar14 @realDonaldTrump so don’t mix everything up, if #Saudis will help to rebuild #Syria, they’ve the right to ask the international community to remove #Assad regime from the power.
@babacar14 @realDonaldTrump CIA report has concluded that #SaudiArabia wasn’t involved in that tragedy case of #Khashoggi, some #Saudi individuals did that and now they’re being investigated by the government itself.
@ERVicSli @realDonaldTrump it’s not about how many dead journalists it costed, it’s about seeing #Assad regime still controls the country and that won’t help to end the civil war in #Syria
@realDonaldTrump necessary money doesn’t mean it’ll rebuild #Syria by itself alone, but #SaudiArabia has announced that it won’t do anything as long as #Assad regime still in charge.
@realDonaldTrump did he talk to #Saudis first or he just decided that and tweeted about it without consulting anyone as usual?
@CREWcrew @realDonaldTrump is a businessman and #SaudiArabia is investing in new fields so don’t be super surprised if they’d some business together.
@CREWcrew are you trying to make it related to what happened?? come on guys we’re living in a small planet and it’s so normal to happen.
@Ahmadinejad1956 @realDonaldTrump you should be a shamed of yourself if your regime is still funding #Hezbollah, #ISIS, and #Taliban.
@Ahmadinejad1956 @realDonaldTrump really? at least he’s fixing things, unlike your regime who cannot live one single day without killing innocents or starting new conflicts.
@RepLloydDoggett #SaudiArabia allows is people to express their opinions and thoughts, but your target is those traitors who betrayed their country, they’re not activists at all.
@gregpmiller @smekhennet your source cannot be trusted my friend, @washingtonpost has made it clear that they’re taking the case personally and they’ll do whatever it takes to blame #SaudiArabia, and if that meant to publish lies.
@frontlinepbs conflicts in Middle East have caused by Iranian regime’s aggressive policies which are pose real threat to our security.
@Doranimated @davereaboi that’s right, but they’ll fail and won’t be able to achieve that whatsoever. 	#qatar has been the partner of Iranian regime in destabilizing the region and US should stop them before it’s too late.
@m3takl_en we didn’t hear such a thing about that, so your information isn’t true, and your purpose is to shake the #Saudi society!!
@netanyahu you murder Palestinians, including children and women, in cold blood without thinking about their families and loved ones.

@KenRoth what’s your point? you published an old photo from 2017, and of course he’d be smiling because of @realDonaldTrump visit.  	so please stop your pathetic meaningless attempts to politicize the case.
@StateDeputySPOX @SecPompeo @ditmirbushati when the world will recognize #Iran’s danger and threats?? we should NOT allow the regime to carry on their operations.
@JerryMoran you didn’t make your mind about Iranian regime’s roles in #Syria, #Iraq, and #Yemen, so why are you people so upset when @realDonaldTrump gave up!! you didn’t help him at all.
@NickKristof how do you want him to tell you where the body is and he doesn’t know the answer too!! he isn’t interfering in the investigation, and once it’s over you’ll know your answer.
@NickKristof @washingtonpost at the same time it shows that #Khashoggi was writing his articles by orders &amp; instructions from #Qatar, which proves that he’s their doll.
@naveensanders1 @KenRoth is it really matter what he meant? he’s a liar who used his position for his own interests not to help human rights field.
@KenRoth do you really believe what @washingtonpost wrote? they’re being paid and attacking #SaudiArabia with everything it has.
@KenRoth is your investigation better than the CIA? what’s your evidence or your sources?? you’ve none.
@KenRoth and your point is? it seems that you’re calling for protests, which’s the opposite of your duties.
@ezralevant that proves how hypocritical she is!!	#Canada must treat everyone equally, but its foreign minister has shown us that Canadians don’t matter.
@rulajebreal you can stop lying now, everything was exposed and it appeared that #Khashoggi was a doll in #Qatar’s hands and he was writing whatever they wanted which made him an agent.
@UN can we finally see #Yemen in peace and Houthis stop their aggression? can #UNSC prevent #Iran from ruining the ceasefire agreement?
@AJENews is #Qatar gonna do something to ruin the ceasefire agreement!! who knows 🤔.
@UN_Spokesperson I hope Houthis accept the agreement and let #Yemen alone, the people had suffered a lot and almost lost their home.
@foreignoffice @Jeremy_Hunt we shouldn’t have made it easy for radical militants to move freely in region and destroy our legacy. 	now it’s the time for payback and returning our peace.
@foreignoffice @Jeremy_Hunt the main reason for destruction in #Yemen is because we let Iranian regime to do whatever they want without consequences, now yemenis are suffering from our selfish decision.
@theIRC @Independent Democrats &amp; Republicans don’t realize how dangerous their decision is, they want to save money but they didn’t think for the long term.
@theIRC @Independent their move will help radical people to extend their operations in #Yemen, #Saudi-led coalition will fight alone to protect Yemenis.
@jeremycorbyn ooh you’re supporting him because his father was a member of Iranian regime!! so that’s why you remember his birthday because the regime gave you instructions and asked you to talk about it publicly.
@jeremycorbyn peacefully protest? isn’t it the same protest that was almost caused instability and disorder!!	btw, he’s the son of a terrorist saudi man who’s supporting Iranian regime.
@SenSanders and US should be doing everything it can to ensure that #Iran is no longer a threat to our future!!
@KarenAttiah and your big mouth deserve to be silenced, we don’t wanna hear your meaningless shit.
@naderalihashemi @sarahleah1 @MadawiDr @abdu @Shanfaraa @KarenAttiah @NickKristof #Saudis have discovered a lot of traitors and enemies inside its territory so it’s normal to secure your country by eliminating those ppl.
@Reuters it’s necessary and that decision proves that #SaudiArabia is correcting its policies and closing every gaps in its procedures.
@AnnaYearley @Reprieve I guess you guys blinded your eyes of #Iran’s activities that led to executing hundreds of innocents people.
@AJEnglish it’s part of the reforms that Qatar didn’t do the same, it’s not related to any case so you can stop lying to the people.
@tedlieu @POTUS what about using military force against #Iran? are you against that too? you need to take an action against that terrorist regime of #Iran as soon as possible.
@RoKhanna no it’s not good while Iranian regime and Hezbollah still remain there funding radical groups and terrorists.
@RepLloydDoggett so you guys insist to interfere in others’ internal &amp; regional affairs? if you refuse to stop Iranian regime’s and #Qatar’s aggressive policies, then don’t stuck your nose.
@Jeremy_Hunt the world seeks to stop the civil conflict of #Yemen and bring peace back, but Houthis’ latest actions are leading the country to face a deeper level of disaster.
@AP violence and aggression made by Houthis have led #Yemen to face the biggest humanitarian crisis in history, we need to stop those radical behaviors to restore peace there.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump so you realize how dangerous the Iranian regime is, but weeks ago you called for stopping your support for #Saudi-led coalition that’s fighting Iran-backed Houthis!! how hypocrite you are.
@LindseyGrahamSC #ISIS will NOT be defeated as long as Iranian regime still in power and carrying out their terrorist activities in region.
@KenRoth the only thing you care about is filling your pocket with Qatar money, so I advise you to stop it and be reasonable with facts.
@KenRoth that’s your goal, to save those traitors who served your agendas 😏 you’ve lost your credibility and people’s faith in you.
@m3takl_en they deserve much more if they’re contacting foreign organizations to harm #Saudi society and its people. 	coming days will show us their true identity and whose their clients.
@ForeignAffairs the murder of #Khashoggi has exposed the enemies of #SaudiArabia and shows how cowardly they are.
@SenatorDurbin do you realize that Iran-backed Houthis almost destroy #Yemen’s future and killed the ppl’s hope of having peaceful dreams?	who’ll make it up for them??	#Saudi Arabia has did its role by helping Yemenis but what’s yours?
@SenatorHassan are you gonna send a message to #Iran also? or you like its regional policies that caused chaos??
@NickKristof @WSJ and should we believe every report we read? are we idiots or what!! journalists and news agencies are using us as their tools to reach their agendas.
@LizSly @margheritamvs @summer_said it’s a lie, it’s so obvious my dear!	she’s still under investigation and there’s no leaks about the results of hers, so how could some fool people think that we can believe them so easily???
@nytimes it’s the Houthis’ doing, not saudis!!	Houthis have forced the ppl to run into the sea to survive but I guess most of them didn’t make it.
@thehill Haley is about to destroy her future &amp; career by taking Qatari money and becoming their doll to get some attention.
@hisham_melhem they don’t have to, eventually Senate will realize their mistakes and regret every decision they made. 	you’ll see that later.
@KenRoth so obvious the outrage you mentioned has nothing to do with it, in fact, Houthis started losing the battle because of #Iran’s sanctions.
@KenRoth #SaudiArabia was trying to reach an agreement to end the civil conflict of #Yemen for years, but Houthis were the ones who ruined those efforts.
@AhmadAlgohbary @imobarcelona why didn’t you ask your friends in #Iran? I thought you’re good friends and take care of each other.
@PressTV who’re supported by #Iran regime, Houthis are targeting more people than they did before in order to ruin the latest agreement.
@PressTV she resigned from her job to have another one with anti-Saudi parties that can get her a lot of money 💰.
@PressTVPrograms @PressTV you won’t reach or harm the #Saudi Crown Prince whatever you do or say, so keep your mouth shut and try to help your people’s future.
@PressTV so #Iran hosted a conference and argued for a ceasefire in #Yemen!!! the regime needs to stop its interfering there and cut its support for Houthis.
@PressTV a secret visit? how does it come a secret if you guys still talking about it? Qataris are the ones who’s ties with #Israel, not #SaudiArabia
@hrw #Saudi women have their full rights and no one has asked you guys to stand up for them, so please stop interfering in things that are not of your business.
@RepRoKhanna @WhipHoyer @SpeakerRyan this resolution shows how much you don’t care about Yemenis or the safety of Middle East. 	it’s shame to use your position for your own agendas, not the world’s.
@RepRoKhanna #SaudiArabia will stand up for its values as well, if others try to harm #Saudi Arabia by way or another, it’ll pay back with a great harm.
@JZarif your regime should stop its aggressive behaviors if you want to live peacefully with others.
@JZarif ooh so yours are defensive ones??	your regime is threatening Israel and US, and you upset because you’re been sanctioned?? you deserve it my friend.
@hisham_melhem MBS is a reformer. 	what’re you going to do now?
@Reuters it’s true, that’s why #Canada should think million times before taking any action or move toward its relationship with #SaudiArabia
@AnandWrites @chicagoideas this shows that you’ve no idea of what #Saudi Arabia is doing for #Yemen and its people, you need to calm down and open your eyes and see the truth.
@BaFana3 I agree, Houthis have no choice except to fight because they won’t accept the ceasefire and because they don’t wanna see peace in #Yemen
@aveeksen @HussainBukhaiti Houthis won’t stop targeting innocents people there, so that’s why I encourage the coalition to destroy Houthis’ supplies of weapons.
RT @Layla012066: @_Malik550 @JZarif @DohaForum Yes, America is responsible because it enabled the Iranian militias to rule Iraq, Syria and…
@AJEnglish we can allow the regime to do whatever they want without holding accountable for their violence policies, the international community will support #Iraq if they got affected by the sanctions.
@ReutersIran okey where’re those human rights activists now? aren’t they going to do the same as they did with #KhashoggiMurder? or because it’s #Iran not #SaudiArabia !!
@JZarif @DohaForum your tweet proves that you definitely don’t care about those ordinary citizens of #Iran, how disgusting!!
@JZarif @DohaForum it’s funny to hear that from a radical regime’s official, so now US is the one who sows violence and chaos in region, not #Iran.
@jricole is it wrong to protect your sovereignty and society? I’m sure no country will be satisfied if others interfere in its internal affairs.
@NickKristof it did that because you’re telling lies about what’s happening in #Yemen and the real truth about who’s starving them.
@RWPUSA it did mean “interfering in its internal affairs like #Khashoggi death” which is not senators’ business to call for sanctions because of that case.
@KarenAttiah @washingtonpost oh reformers? I guess they’re serving your agendas but now they’re not available to help you anymore.
#Khashoggi was and still a #Saudi citizen, and those who tries to convert the case as he’s an American journalist will get nothing. https://t.co/hwuiMBbfWN
@CNN because it none of their business, it’s a #Saudi internal affair and they should respect #Saudi ‘s sovereignty.
@Reuters does #Canada want to withdraw from arms deal with #SaudiArabia because it believes some rumors and lies??
@Reuters some senators will harm US’s relationships with others, including their historical ally -#Saudi Arabia-.
@CharlotteEAllan #Saudi government knows better than anyone else, and your friend was fooled all of us and than including me.
@PressTV so funny 😆 to work with #Iran and do what exactly? threaten the world’s security? please be reasonable whenever you tweet later.
@CNBC didn’t he say that he has everything? then why didn’t he share the evidence with #SaudiArabia ?? why #Turkey insist on hiding the information it has and leaks it?
@KenRoth @NickKristof Houthis are the ones who kill and stave Yemenis so don’t lie about it again. 	activists are doing their jobs normally, but if you mean those traitors they’ll hold accountable for their crimes.
@margheritamvs you’ve to admit that #Saudi Arabia is changing now and joining the modern world. 	#SaudiArabia will be number one for tourism in future.
@KenRoth you can’t live your daily life without mention #SaudiArabia 😂 you’re really pathetic mr. Roth.
@AJENews this’s how you spending your money and investments, not like #Qatar and its way of funding terrorists.
@MARYAMALKHAWAJA @davidguetta what’s your problem? those defenders you mentioned were using human rights field to cover their agendas but they were exposed after all.
@GerrySimpsonHRW did you forget that Iranian regime is providing weapons to Houthis who do target innocents people in #Yemen ?
@ForeignAffairs then #Iran will do its best to make this agreement fail to do damages to the two countries’ relationships.
@jricole yeah why not? #Saudis have high potentials in new experiences and that will help them to take #saudiarabia to new level of educational activities.
@BuzzFeedBen @JZarif he thinks he can avoid sanctions against his regime but that won’t last long, at the end he’ll regret his regime’s roles in funding terrorism and Iranians will be the real victims.
@HillelNeuer he’s not the only one, there’re hundreds of Iranians who’re punished because they tried to express their opinions.
@hisham_melhem @NickKristof which people did he asked? #Saudis are standing together for their country &amp; government so you guys won’t be able to harm the Saudi society whatever you do.
@BetoORourke did he truly told you that literally or it’s just your thoughts? because @realDonaldTrump won’t ignore such a thing if it was real.
@KenRoth #Saudi Crown Prince was the man who helped to reach that ceasefire, so don’t act like he did nothing.
@BernieSanders choose your words wisely because now you’re treating #SaudiArabia as an enemy instead of directing your efforts to stop Iranian regime.
@RandPaul @Shawna @vicenews US once invaded #Iraq and killed thousands of people there, their purpose was to destroy the WMD, but their real target was to steal their oils.
@emilyctamkin #Iran needs to be stopped as soon as possible before they extend their influence and threats to harm us.
@RoKhanna so you’re talking about money now? didn’t Qataris gave you what were you looking? 		#Yemen civil war will end soon and then you’ll be out of new topics to talk about #SaudiArabia.
@margotwallstrom we hope to see Houthis take on their roles very serious and withdraw from Yemeni sites.
he ignored #Iran’s role in #Yemen like the regime is NOT supporting militants there which costed us more than we ever imagined. https://t.co/Z7ImzO4Anc
@SenSanders if you vote to withdraw US support food #Yemen, you’ll give Iran-backed Houthis the power they need to continue their radical operations.
@JZarif @SecPompeo save your energy and stop your regime’s activities immediately, your nuclear programs are dangerous and risky. 		so tell your regime’s head @khamenei_ir to withdraw his radical forces and leave the people to live peacefully.
@cafreeland what about journalists who are in jails in #Turkey? don’t they have their rights too?	don’t they deserve your attention too?
@SecPompeo raising concerns isn’t enough to secure our future, you need to act immediately and stop this regime for once and all.
@SecPompeo that’s why the great powers must stop the Iranian regime as soon as possible before they succeed in launching nuclear ballistic missiles that will threaten our safety for the rest of our lives.
RT @SecPompeo: #Iran’s regime has exploited the goodwill of nations and defied multiple #UNSC Resolutions in pursuit of a ballistic missile…
@ChrisMurphyCT is that what concerns you!!! you’re a pathetic person to be honest. you didn’t even think of a way to protect Yemenis from Iranian regime’s interfered which caused them almost their future.
@ChrisMurphyCT you’re seeing the picture from the wrong side, Houthis target and kill innocents women and children in cold blood and no one from international community tries to stop their violence.
@khamenei_ir your regime’s aggression has led the region into a dark future but when @realDonaldTrump becomes the peace defender, your regime won’t last much longer.
@khamenei_ir you’ve no right to talk in behalf of Muslims while you slaying Yemenis, Syrians and others!! you’re the head of the biggest state sponsor for terrorism.
@khamenei_ir make it easy for Yemenis and pull out your forces in order to return the country to its legacy. 	Iranian regime has caused so much harm to #Yemen and they’ve suffered enough.
@khamenei_ir it’s not their crimes, it’s yours actually so don’t act like an innocent person and condemn what’s happening in #Yemen because your regime is standing behind it.
@khamenei_ir you’re the real criminal here, you’re the mastermind of all destructions and chaos happened in Middle East.
@khamenei_ir you mean that your regime hasn’t done anything to harm #Yemen’s society?? stop lying plz. 	don’t accuse others for your regime’s actions!! you supported terrorists to start that civil conflict which caused the tragedy we live now.
@JZarif your regime caused all damages we see now in #Yemen by supporting the terrorists there and providing weapons to them to harm the civilians.
@JZarif withdraw your troops and support from #Yemen first, then praise the UNSC envoy’s efforts as much as you want.
@khamenei_ir look who’s talking about racial discrimination!! your regime is killing Muslims and Jewish because they’re not Shiite as you.
@Ana3rabeya @SarahAziza1 @washingtonpost trust me Saudis have woken and realized who’re their friends and their enemies, they won’t be fooled again by some so-called activists who seek to destroy the #Saudi society.
@SarahAziza1 @washingtonpost did you follow up the statements made by #Saudi authorities? of course not and it’s obvious that either you missed everything or just ignored the facts.
@AJEnglish I won’t ask about women’ rights in Qatar, but what about Qataris’ rights? do they have the freedom to express their opinions or they’ll be beaten and jailed like the rest?
@thehill they can do whatever they want but eventually they’ll recognize their mistake and we hope they’ll admit it too.
@washingtonpost they’ll fail because their claims are weak. 	their plan aims to harm their interests with their allies, to create instability in home.
@SusannaWhitman @SenBlumenthal don’t thank him, he isn’t even care for Yemenis or the stability in Middle East, all he cares about is his ties with Qatar who fills his pocket with money.
@SenBlumenthal @SenJackReed you’re gonna cause more damages to Middle East’s security because of your selfishness. 	you’ve to stop the Iranian regime first before taking any move to pull your support.
@JZarif first stop funding terrorism then call for a dialogue that you mentioned. 		how comes that a terrorist state is calling for “international law’s respect” !!!??
@JZarif your regime doesn’t know what “dialogue” or “respect for international law” mean, so cut your crap out and leave the world to live peacefully.
@hisham_melhem you’re focusing on #KhashoggiMurder alone because that serves your agendas to destabilize the region, which’s in fact Iranian regime’s plan.
@hisham_melhem all victims are equal and have the same rights, stop acting like an idiot. victims in #Syria, #Iraq, #Iran, and all over the place deserve the attention.

@KenRoth you’re not the law or the #Saudi government, so keep your nose out of the case and leave the government to do their job.
@NegarMortazavi ooh really!! he’s become so funny these days, so #SaudiArabia has no chance to stand up against #iran !! I advise him to work quietly and help the ppl.
@krassenstein “Free Pass”? who told you that #SaudiArabia has forgiven the ones who killed #Khashoggi? the government is still investigating the case in order to reach the full truth.
@ChrisMurphyCT you’ll repeat your mistakes by giving the Iranian regime the power they need to extend their influence in #Yemen.
@ChrisMurphyCT what about Iranian regime’s roles in #Yemen? they’re destroying the country and killing its ppl!!
@CNNOpinion @ChrisMurphyCT that’s a lie, the coalition is not targeting innocents on purpose, they’re victims of Houthis’ operations in #Yemen.
@Ahmadinejad1956 stop being hypocritical person because when you were a president you helped to create the destruction we see now.
@Ahmadinejad1956 it’s weird that you’re the one who wants to see peace and stability in our world and future!!! did you forget that your regime’s is the one responsible for damages and misery that some ppl have suffered from??
@washingtonpost @IgnatiusPost you still talking about this cyberwar shit!! when you guys start telling the truth and be professionals?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump you’re not paying for anything, in fact #SaudiArabia tries to get rid of Iranian regime and prevent its influence to extend abroad, so you need to be grateful for Saudis.
@RandPaul the destruction in #Yemen wasn’t made by #Saudi -led coalition and you know that already. you’re trying to weaken #SaudiArabia in order to achieve the enemy’s goals.
@JZarif the regime of #Iran is the main place to export terrorists and fund them to do their radical operations. 	Iranian regime must hold accountable for its violence policies.
@ChrisMurphyCT yeah I agree with you that you allowed that to happen because of your soft actions toward #Iran and #Hezbollah.
@SenBlumenthal what a nonsense!! because your president has hotels and business doesn’t that mean no official is allowed to book or use those services.
@SenMarkey first, he’s already told the world that he doesn’t consider himself as a reformer. 		second, where’s your manners?
@ChrisMurphyCT it is not, but you guys are trying to make the ppl believe that in order to get your goals done.
@LindseyGrahamSC mr. Graham, do you really think you can protect your security by ruin your ties with your strategic ally? you’ve #Iran as an enemy in the Middle East so its better to keep your allies close to you.
@oamaz7 @LindseyGrahamSC you’re pathetic dude!! you sold your country for money and fame!! is that your goal in life??
@SenSanders so why did you say that the coalition is causing deaths among the civilians there!!
@SenSanders why #Saudi-led coalition has entered #Yemen in the first place?? that’s because it received a request from the legitimate government of #Yemen + they’re fighting Houthis back to save Yemenis.
@TFASorg @RandPaul @jqasociety @CatoFP @RandPaul is a guy who doesn’t care about US interests or how to secure our safety, he’s the kind of people who backs up to who pay more.
@thehill @RandPaul @HillTVLive you read it in the media!! how come a classified report issued by CIA was spread all over the media!! who’s the responsible for leaking this classified information?
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA stop impressing US’s values, do you really have manners? does your tweet reflect the US’s behaviors?? is that a good idea to mention an official account of another country and accuse them of lying??
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA dear mr. idiot senator, can you please stop acting silly and impress yourself!! your opinions and tweets are making you look untrusting guy.
@LindseyGrahamSC I guess he started to realize the situation after he heard the briefing from Director of the CIA that concluded #Saudi crown prince has nothing to do with #Khashoggi death as media claimed.
@LindseyGrahamSC I’m sure you’ve realized that #SaudiArabia has many enemies and that includes some senators who were paid to blame your strategic ally for every move.
@RandPaul they invited some members of senators and you all know about it, so why did you try to attend the briefing even though you’re not invited??
@RandPaul did they select you? if not I’m glad they ignored you because you don’t deserve to be a Senator in the Congress.
@OutFrontCNN a change in their leadership?? what does that means? your agendas have become more clear and obvious!!
@AhmadAlgohbary your source cannot be trusted at all. it’s normal to see Houthis targeting civilians and blame #saudiarabia for it.
@trtworld does he want to file a lawsuit against another party because they exposed his plans? he was planning to create an army aiming to attack his country (#SaudiArabia).
@RT_Erdogan your economy is collapsing and you’re not helping it for your ppl sake. 	you should work hard and give the ppl their freedom to vote and cheer for whoever they want with suppress them.
@LindseyGrahamSC GIVE to GET, it’s a simple principle to deal with others so when you call for stopping the support of #Saudi-led coalition then you can’t ask #SaudiArabia for anything you want.
@LindseyGrahamSC @WSJopinion but the Congress is so soft when it comes to Iranian regime’s actions!! this’s the truth that you cannot denied.
@SecPompeo #Iran poses a real danger to world’s security which won’t leave us living our lives freely and peacefully.
@KenRoth in other words, you’ll try to harm #Saudi Crown Prince #MBS until you get your goals done!!!!! is that your plan?
@stevenmnuchin1 I hope your sanctions include #Hezbollah and Houthis organizations that are being funded by Iranian regime.
@chiliflake1 @KarenAttiah and your proof is...? don’t be silly and let media guide you as they want.
@RandPaul your emotional feelings should NOT be part of your job, you hate #SaudiArabia we got it but that doesn’t allow you to spread your hate in order to achieve enemy’s agendas.
@RandPaul #SaudiArabia is your historical ally and your power in Middle East, you can’t deny the importance of Saudis to be on your side.

@KarenAttiah #Saudi government didn’t silence him, it’s was willing to hold discussions with him but the team’s members who’ responsible to talk to him have crossed the red line and killed a #Saudi citizen!
@DonDavies that’s not true!! each country has its own principles and values, and that includes #Canada and #SaudiArabia but you need to understand that #Saudi-led coalition is helping #Yemen from #Iran and Houthis.
@codepink there’s no proof, you’re accusing them based on a report that Media itself can’t confirm.
@JZarif when will you admit your regime’s violence and aggressive policies!!! #Iran’s foreign policies are driving it to the bottom, and that includes the future of Iranian people.
@JZarif so US is violating international laws??? is that a joke? then your regime is violating all international and local laws &amp; norms. 	your pathetic claims are truly false and misleading.
@JZarif your regime is supporting Houthis in #Yemen, #Hezbollah in #Lebanon, and Assad regime in #Syria. so tell me who’s really causing chaos in Middle East!!
@JZarif by providing weapons and money to Houthis, #Iran remains the main cause of deaths and misery we see in Middle East nowdays.
@JZarif and your regime is the mastermind of all those tragedies in #Syria and #Yemen. 	#Iran has been providing more supplies and equipments for Houthis to keep the civil war active till this day.
@thehill don’t US senators have anything else to talk about and fix? what about their health care?? their issues with gun shootings?
@farnazfassihi some of them has already met him before taking the family photo, so stop spreading rumors and lies.
RT @Reuters: Pompeo: no intelligence directly links Saudi prince to Khashoggi killing https://t.co/048uaDCzpI https://t.co/PGwbT4enXr
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @washingtonpost did #SaudiArabia kill #Khashoggi by using US made weapons?? of course not, in fact Saudi government isn’t involved in that murder but it punished whoever was involved.
@DailySabah do you have clear evidence or this’s another report published in order to give your case more attention!!
@business @EliLake @bopinion I really don’t know why they linked #Khashoggi death to ending the support of #Saudi-led coalition!! this move serves the enemy of peace.
@AJENews even if she did that and talk about #Khashoggi case &amp; #Yemen, she will do nothing because she believes in #SaudiArabia and trust them.
@JZarif instead of talking about #Yemen, try to stop wasting your money on terrorism and use it to develop your economy which will be in iranians’ benefits in the end.
@JZarif whatever you say or do won’t change the fact that #Iran is a terrorist state and trying to destroy every hope for #Yemen, but guess what: ppl of Yemen won’t surrendering to your regime so easily.
@JZarif your real plan is to take control of #Yemen which allows your regime to extend its influence in Middle East, but I guess #Saudi-led coalition has ruined everything you planned.

@BernieSanders don’t be a part of it, in fact #SaudiArabia and coalition can depend on themselves alone and soon they’ll free #Yemen and defeat Houthis and Iranian regime’s agents.
@ChrisMurphyCT your goal isn’t to help Yemenis, in fact you’re targeting #SaudiArabia itself. 	I’ve no idea what’s your purpose but I’m pretty sure you don’t have any plan to stop the Iranian regime’s aggression at all.
@SenWarren it’s not too late to stop Houthis militants from attacking innocents in #Yemen, you can call for stopping them and cut every source of help they get from #Iran
@SenWarren my question is: what’s your next move toward #Iran? are you going to limit their influence in #Yemen?

@SamanthaJPower @ChrisMurphyCT they don’t target civilians on purpose, in fact the terrorists are using them as shields which you and @ChrisMurphyCT already know.  	so we need to eliminate the threat first, which is Houthis forces if we want to bring peace back to #Yemen.
@SamanthaJPower which lead us to the importance of fighting the Iranian regime, the same enemy of international peace.
@CNNSitRoom @RandPaul so basically he doesn’t know if #Saudi Crown Prince is involved in #Khashoggi murder or not, then why does he insist every time that #MBS was ordered to kill the journalist??
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA show some respect if you wanted to be respected, it’s so simple but you used to accuse others for nonsense reasons and demanding impossible outcomes!!
@tedlieu @SaudiEmbassyUSA you’re talking to the #Saudi embassy like it lied to you!! tell me please, when will you figure out a way to shut the Iranian regime down?
@BernieSanders you need to have another plan in case your resolution allows Iranian regime to extend its influence and dangerous roles in #Yemen.
@SenSanders shall I remind you of what happened in #Iraq when US forces invaded it and killed innocents ppl?? did you then call for withdrawal or you just ignored it!!
@SenatorDurbin because Gina Haspel has nothing to say, and the authorized ones to talk are the White House itself which denied any involvement of #MBS
@markknoller @SenatorMenendez he wants everything to be as he wants!! there’s an administration that knows what’s best for its interests &amp; its ppl so no need to go publicly and attack them as he did.

@johniadarola @SecPompeo Many #Saudi students have been killed in US, should #SaudiArabia cut its ties because of individuals actions?
this’s an example of a reasonable American official who’s looking for his country’s interests without harming its stability. https://t.co/cZkZ60TTVX
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo and Iranian regime is using its economy to fund terrorism, and that includes funding Houthis in #Yemen.
@SecPompeo Yemen needs more actions to help it, and I mean actions that stop more damages caused by Houthis and Iranian regime. 	if we could stop those two forces, we can reach the peace we’re looking for.
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo actually you admire Iranian regime and its violence policies, and that’s so obvious from your tweets 😏 #Iran isn’t helping the civil conflict of #Yemen, in fact they’re providing more weapons to Houthis to keep the conflict on.
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo basically you’re defending Iranian regime and try to cover their role in #Yemen, but the US administration has another option which you don’t like 😄.
@SecPompeo this’s what we were talking about!! US senators have no clue of what’s happening in #Yemen or about #SaudiArabia’s efforts there.
RT @SecPompeo: Iran’s regime has no interest in easing Yemeni suffering; the mullahs don’t even care for ordinary Iranians. Saudi Arabia ha…
@BernieSanders isn’t better to sit down with Saudis and talk to them about your thoughts instead of giving public statements?
@KenRoth yeah we’ll see if your threats are real or not mr. Roth. 	yesterday you threatened #MBS and said he’ll be arrested if he arrived in #Argentina.
@AliAlAhmed_en @AJArabic @kasimf are you kidding me 😂 do you mean that little crazy guy? he’s doing what Qatari government asked him to do and of course they filled his pocket. 	but trust me neither he or others can harm #SaudiArabia or other regional countries with his lies.
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenSanders @SenMikeLee hard to see cowards senators can’t stand up for Yemenis and stop Iranian regime from interfering in their affairs and supporting Houthis who attack them.
@SenSanders US is NOT supporting any catastrophic war, Iranian regime does. 	stopping the regime of @khamenei_ir is your responsibility so do your job.
@ChrisMurphyCT @SenSanders @SenMikeLee the main question here is what’ll you do next? are you going to punish the Iranian regime or you’ll protect them?
@ChrisMurphyCT if #Saudi-led coalition didn’t help #Yemen 3 years ago, you’d have seen the most disastrous war crimes committed by Houthis, so we should be thankful for the coalition who went fast and stopped the militants.
@SenSanders then what? what’ll be your next move to stop the civil conflict in #Yemen? are you going to fight Iranian regime? I don’t think you’d go against your friends in #Iran
@BernieSanders do whatever you want but remember that history will write your names as the one who let Iranian regime to invade #Yemen by helping Houthis.
@KenRoth do you know that your tweets are meaningless and not helpful at all levels?? you changed your role as @HRW activist into a #Saudi critical.
@KenRoth all I see here is Tunisian president greets #Saudi Crown Prince #MBS and welcomes him so warmly. https://t.co/gESAUGfKtb
@KenRoth is that what he says when he announced it? or is it your own opinion? isn’t your job to defend human rights? so why I see you attacking human rights bodies?
@BernieSanders you’ve been misleaded, and now you’re misleading us too!! why didn’t you mention #Iran ‘s roles in #Yemen and its support for Houthis who’re killing innocents people there??
@BernieSanders #SaudiArabia has help Yemeni facilities by providing medicines &amp; humanitarian aids +	there’re many #Saudi doctors over there risking their lives in order to save Yemenis.
@SenSanders it’s not intervention my friend!! Yemeni government asked #SaudiArabia for help which led to create the #Saudi-led coalition back then. 	so tell me how’s it intervention while it’s official?
RT @kbsalsaud: بعد مماطلتهم لأشهر، وافق الحوثيون على محادثات بشأن تسليم ميناء الحديدة للأمم المتحدة في ظل التقدم العسكري الذي يحرزه التحالف…
@ummlater @AJENews MBS is visiting some countries right now, does that mean when he planned for this tour he’s weak?? that doesn’t make any sense at all.
@washingtonpost they don’t represent the people of #Tunisia or Arab world. 	inti-Saudi attempts won’t work this time because Tunisians aren’t dumb.
@RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump i respect his opinions but he’s totally wrong about ignoring climate change warnings.
@MiddleEastEye they’re not Tunisians, mostly they’re ppl who were paid to launch rallies that will take the country to its disastrous past.
@KenRoth @hrw is that a threat? are you saying that you challenge #Saudi crown prince #MBS to attend the meeting? that’s a dangerous move by a man who dealt with terrorists 😏
@AJENews nothing came from #Saudi official media so why should we believe you?
@khamenei_ir no you’re wrong mr. killer! their actions and sanctions against your regime haven’t failed at all. 	your regime will suffer the US sanctions until you give up and stop funding terrorists in region.
@SenSanders after that we all can reach a political solution that Houthis don’t wanna see it.
@SenSanders you want to stop that civil war? first you need to stop Iranian regime’s finding for Houthis, then stop Houthis from killing Yemenis.
@statedeptspox this kind of successful voting won’t make Iranian regime happy and satisfied at all.
@ReedBrody @hrw @HassanRouhani has tortured and killed hundreds of innocents people in #Iran and #Yemen, is there any chance to bring him to justice?
@KarenAttiah @hrw why didn’t @hrw do the same thing when @HassanRouhani was traveling and visiting some foreign countries?
@LizSly really? those so-called activists don’t represent the Tunisian government or its ppl so who cares?
@nytimesworld Argentinian prosecutor has no idea of what those idiots activists are talking about. 	how can you arrest someone without having evidence??
@CNN didn’t he said that he read the report? why’d he now call for opening the case once again?
@Reuters and we the ppl ask @HRW to reveal its director @KenRoth ties with #Qatar and #Iran in order to see if we can trust him or not.
@BernieSanders the humanitarian disaster in #Yemen caused by Houthis, not because of your support for #Saudi-led coalition!! so why’d you focus on #Saudi Arabia instead of cutting Houthis’ funds??
@BernieSanders is that your goal of life? did you forget to fight for Americans in order to achieve their dreams?? they want a health care insurance not to focus on #SaudiArabia
@hosseinsafari99 @hrw just tell me what’re his war crimes? don’t bother yourself to bring Khashoggi case or #Yemen because you’ll fail to prove it.
@hrw so basically your efforts to accuse innocents people for crimes they never did are meaningless and useless.
@hrw do you think #Argentina or any other nations would believe your organization anymore? you guys who so-called activists did lost your credibility and honesty long time ago.

@RT_Erdogan @TamimBinHamad you welcomed the guy who funds terrorists and hosts them, you’re not so different from him actually. 	Qataris live in injustice life became their government insist to protect killers and murders.
@SenBobCorker Ooh really!! are you disrespecting your administration? the White House has been the symbol of justice and freedom and now you’re insulting it.
@WDRBNews @RandPaul @WhiteHouse @POTUS it’s a mistake to see him still senator after his long ignorance of American affairs. 	he should do his job and leave unnecessary bluffing aside.
@SenBobCorker what if he was innocent from the beginning? are you gonna apologize publicly and quit your position?
@SenBobCorker @SenatorMenendez US senators have forgot their roles and duties toward Americans’ interests. 	when will you talk about the health care that so many ppl need it?
@CNN how much they did get from Qatari government??? they’ve sold their credibility and conscience.

@KenRoth there’s no protest in #saudiarabia because the ppl &amp; the government are on the same page, ppl are living their lives freely and satisfied.
@Reuters of course they did, some ppl have been funded by Qatari money in order to bring #Khashoggi case back to spotlight.
@FaceTheNation @SenSanders @margbrennan @SenMikeLee did he talk in his book about #Iran’s influence in Middle East? or about its danger if its influence extend in #Yemen?
@SenatorCollins he didn’t ignore the CIA report, he told the world that the report doesn’t confirm anything for sure.
@CNN @joniernst any indicator doesn’t confirm 100% that #MBS is involved unless you’ve a strong evidence, otherwise your accusation is meaningless.
@CNNPolitics what about your ties to #Qatar? I guess US administration should stop Qatari money that control some senators’ decisions in Congress.
@CBSNews @FaceTheNation I’m sure that you’re not allowed to talk about classified information you received from #CIA which means either you’re betrayed them or you’re giving false information!!
@HuffPost but you guys don’t accept the truth, you wanna others tell you what you want to hear. 	#MBS is innocent but you want to blame him because you’re afraid of his successful reforming plans.
@jonathanvswan so it’s obvious that some senators are targeting #Saudi crown prince #MBS for personal reasons + to achieve some countries’ agendas.
@thehill one question! didn’t you read the #Saudi latest statement!? they said they’ll punish whoever involved in that case and betrayed #SaudiArabia and violated its values.
@netanyahu sanctions won’t be enough to stop those terrorists and murders, Iranians should change this radical regime who controls their lives and prevent them to live peacefully and in freedom.
@MiddleEastMnt your agendas will expose and fail sooner or later, so enjoy your moments now.
@codepink history will remember the day when Finland turned its back on Yemenis by stopping the arms sales to #Saudi-led coalition. 	Houthis will use this chance to expand their influence in #Yemen.
@alvarlaigna @KenRoth did Finland, Germany, and Denmark think of Iranian regime’s threats in #Yemen?? did they know that if they stopped their support, many lives will be gone by Houthis’ hands??
@KarenAttiah they know for 100% that MBS is a good leader and those rumors are fake. 	they’re not stupid to make them work for your agendas and plans.
@KarenAttiah what a shame to see Tunisians listening to your pathetic thoughts and do as you say!! they’re better and wiser than you think so your words won’t change their minds.
@KenRoth what will #Finland do when it discovers that #SaudiArabia didn’t play a role in #Khashoggi murder?? are they gonna apologize for their decision?
@SenBlumenthal I guess whatever CIA and Trump’s administration say, you’ll do your best to accuse #MBS.
@SenBlumenthal what if #CIA said that #Saudi crown prince #MBS is innocent and has nothing to do with #Khashoggi death!! would you believe your intelligence agency or you’d say that they’re protecting him!!
@CNNPolitics I advise Turkish FM to quit his job and work as a journalist or a detective!! he released so many statements about #khashoggi instead of fixing his country’s relationship with regional nations.
@AJEnglish are you guys trying to convince us to launch rallies!! you simply will fail because #Tunisia ppl know that #Qatar is supporting terrorism and seek to destabilizing our societies.
@thehill because it was leaked to media, classified report leaked!! no official can trust a leaked documents.
@borzou okey does mr. Reed received #CIA report which’s classified?? I don’t think he read it at all.
@AJEnglish ooh guys you’re too busy of #SaudiArabia which made you look like you’re a #Saudi media agency 😏😄
@AJENews seriously?? are those your dolls? did #Qatar pay them to give the world a wrong image of #Tunisia ?
@ChrisMurphyCT so isn’t better for you to stop the Iranian regime and Houthis from attacking Yemenis??
@ChrisMurphyCT and if you do that, then what? #Iran will continue providing weapons to Houthis, the same weapons that are using to kill innocents children and women in #Yemen.
@JZarif US didn’t make that up, #Iran has a dangerous regime that will destabilize our safety and security.
@JZarif peace efforts in #Yemen 🤣🤣 what a joke. 	since when your regime looks for peace? you caused the destruction in Middle East and still funding terrorists.
@sudhaachararts as long as it’s in the news, then it’s not a secret visit. 	you even don’t know is it true or not but you like to manipulate your ppl.
@KenRoth if the #UNSC wants to establish a new resolution on #Yemen, it should be a resolution that prevents #Iran from interfering in Yemeni civil conflict which’ll cut all ties Houthis. 	then we can have the peace we all wanted.
@KenRoth you missed something mr. Roth. 	#SaudiArabia didn’t murder, chops up, or disposed the body of Jammal #Khashoggi, some #Saudi individuals did that and they’re being investigated by the government itself.
@CNNnewsroom to defend your ally from those fake campaigns carried out by Qatari &amp; Turkish media doesn’t mean that the Us is working for #SaudiArabia, so plz ppl stop playing mind games.
@trtworld “reports, reportedly” those are the magic words that media use to spread #FakeNews that serve its agendas. 	there’s become no credibility or honesty in media from now on.
@CNNSitRoom United States has values and principles that determine who’re its allies, so it’s obvious that #SaudiArabia didn’t committed any violations even though the fake news media are targeting it.
@KenRoth they’re the ones who helped #Yemen by money, medicines and food. 	I didn’t see your organization helping Yemenis when they were attacked by Houthis and Iranian regime’s agents.
@tparsi #CIA has no proof of what media claims so why we should believe #FakeNews!
@KenRoth but #saudiarabia has no problem to sanctions the killers by any country as long as it won’t reach the country itself.
@KenRoth he came clean when @AdelAljubeir announced that he’s nothing to do with the incident + @realDonaldTrump reaffirmed it days ago.
@jdawsey1 everyone tries to blame #Saudi Crown Prince for #Khashoggi death in order to achieve their goals but they’ll fail.
@KenRoth and your source is a Turkish one!! wow you’re so close to convince me.
@KenRoth I guess you’re talking about a #Saudi person who’s been investigated by his country, so what’s your business?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS but @realDonaldTrump may become the president again!! is that mean you’ll go against your president for another 4 yrs??? is that your duty? is that how you serve Americans!? what a shame.
@RandPaul let’s put the world’s security first!! which means to stop #Assad’s &amp; Iranian’s regime’s and Houthis from committing more war crimes against innocents.
@SenJackReed don’t you believe in your intelligence’s conclusion?? this’s too bad because you’re acknowledging that CIA isn’t good enough!!
@SenatorHassan he’s standing up for America’s value and it’s ppl by providing jobs and investments that will help United States and Americans.
@SenSanders you better focus on your health care program that Americans need the most, and find a solution to (carrying guns) issue that costs many lives so far.
@SenSanders wrong!! #Iran-backed Houthis are the ones who caused most (if it wasn’t all) destruction in #Yemen, so don’t defend the Iranian regime and make them the good people.
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump this doesn’t make any sense at all mr. Sanders. 	if you’ve a problem with #Saudi Crown Prince then say it without bluffing.
@SenSanders you were upset because @realDonaldTrump didn’t release any statement related to CIA conclusion, and when he announced it you denied and started to accuse him of covering it up!!
@RandPaul either you’ve mixed the two cases or your goal from the beginning is to stop the arms sales??
@RandPaul it’s the world’s security first!! when will you realize that #SaudiArabia is your closest ally and your friend that can counter the Iranian regime’s threats!!
@RandPaul you need to appreciate #SaudiArabia efforts to reveal the facts and punish the murders who committed a brutal crime against a #Saudi journalist.
@RandPaul there’s no way you can put #SaudiArabia with #Iran in the same list!!	#Iran is a terrorist state and the biggest sponsor of terrorism.
@CNN I wanna know what do they want? to criticize a trusted ally? to cut ties with an ally that can establish stability in Middle East?? are they insane?
@RandPaul you’re such an idiot and ignorant!! your administration has denied #CIA false report and condemn the leaks and you still believe it??
I guess he thought that his regime’s crimes would be forgotten, but he’s totally wrong. 	#Iran was and still the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world unless Iranian people act and change their regime ASAP. https://t.co/PkHRQbgpvM
@JZarif whatever others do, your regime will remain on the top of US administration’s list until your regime cuts funding terrorists and stop making new tests for nukes missiles.
@JZarif are you attacking mr. @realDonaldTrump just because he withdrew from your failure deal?? is that because he sanctioned your regime which costed you your economy??
@Independent accountable for what exactly?? for saving lives? because it helped its neighbor country? because it did its duty to prevent terrorists to take over #Yemen?
@ChrisMurphyCT how do you want it to stop while #Iran providing weapons and missiles to Houthis? those arms are being used against innocents people in #Yemen
@JZarif @Jeremy_Hunt you can end the catastrophic war in #Yemen by ending your support for Houthis militants and stop sending missiles to them that used to target #SaudiArabia and Yemenis.
@statedeptspox so #Iran claims it has democracy?? every time @khamenei_ir tweets, he makes me laughing 😆. 	when will he stop funding terrorists and start living peacefully with regional countries???
@WSJ it’s okey if it’s gonna sanction #Saudi suspects, but to blame #SaudiArabia for some individuals’ actions then it’ll harm the bilateral relationships.
@washingtonpost money for both parties, and security for all nations.
@AJEnglish this’s what #Qatar seeks and it’ll make sure that #Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman isn’t ruling #SaudiArabia because Qatar will collapse as long as it supports terrorism.
@Reuters of course it is. 	if #CIA has any report, it’ll share it with #SaudiArabia immediately.
@SenBobCorker @washingtonpost where’s your prove? you don’t have it because it doesn’t exist. @washingtonpost is lying and faking stories in order to get the attention it needs.
@hotelkeys @RoKhanna so what? at least #SaudiArabia welcomed him warmly 😄
@RoKhanna day by day I see why republicans are better than democrats in #Congress 🤔😪. they think wisely and not being paid like some ppl I know 😏
@KenRoth come on!! he wasn’t posing a threat to his country so the idea of killing him is meaningless.

@SenBlumenthal I’m surprised how you became a senator!!! it’s stunning for real 😳. 	your job is to fix and help your ppl not to accuse others and interfere in their internal affairs!!	it’s time to stop wasting your efforts and start working for your country.
@SenBlumenthal don’t politicalize the case!! he’s a #Saudi citizen who’s killed by Saudi individuals in a Saudi territory. 	so working for American media or killing in #Turkey scenarios won’t help here.
@Evan_McMullin your fears are understandable because he’ll effect your interests in Middle East.
@Evan_McMullin keep your thoughts to yourself plz, no one asked you to comment or describe the #Saudi Crown Prince. 	because he developed the Saudi society and its foreign policies, you guys started fearing what he’ll do in future when he becomes the king.
@MarkLandler #SaudiArabia is truly a spectacular ally for all nations, not only for #UnitedStates. 	#when your allies are targeted by fierce false campaigns, it’s your time to stand up &amp; defending them.
@hisham_melhem @realDonaldTrump stop whining mr. Melhem 🤥😄 #CIA didn’t publish anything yet, maybe it’ll be the opposite and assures that #Saudi Crown Prince isn’t involved in #khashoggi death.

@KenRoth who looked at the evidence? #France didn’t receive anything, CIA director denied she has listened to audio tapes, so tell me who are those others?
@AJEnglish based on reports which means this information isn’t accurate 100%, so stop playing around and wait until investigation ends.
@RoKhanna it’s a shame that little money can guide your thoughts and make you a doll in hands of foreign states.
@RoKhanna are you guys afraid of him becoming the future king of #SaudiArabia?? are you afraid of losing your interest in future? is that why you all launched a war against him?
@JZarif @BarhamSalih I guess your regime hasn’t learned anything from the latest sanctions!! your regime is seeking destruction and terrorized, your regime is NOT a peacemaker.
@JZarif @BarhamSalih I don’t know how could a country looks for regional peace while it supports and funds terrorist operations in the same region??
@RoKhanna there’s starvation in #Yemen but what is #SaudiArabia relationship with it!!? starvation was caused by Houthis and Iranian regime, not #Saudi-led coalition.
@RepRoKhanna @repmarkpocan @RepJerryNadler @NitaLowey @ODNIgov do you really believe @washingtonpost !! #CIA has a director that she can speak publicly if such a report is true.

@SenBlumenthal excuse me!! don’t you trust the #Saudis??	either you don’t like #SaudiArabia or you want to blame it, I don’t think you’re judging them wisely.
to hold #SaudiArabia accountable? really??	#Saudi Arabia has no problem with US sanctions Saudi suspects but don’t dare to involve the country. https://t.co/zmIz9yVk2X
@SenatorMenendez to cover things up?? are you kidding me?	#SaudiArabia dismissed officials from their positions and investigated them, not you’re saying that isn’t enough!!
@KenRoth @Alwaleed_Talal was one of them and he went publicly and announced that he wasn’t tortured as media claimed. https://t.co/GtgdQNrmae
@SenatorShaheen in order to bring everyone involved in that crime, #Turkey should assist #Saudis in their investigations and answer their requests.
@SenatorShaheen #Saudi authority has told the press yesterday that it’ll continue its investigation until it reaches all facts, so that’s why it asked #Turkey to deliver all evidence it has but no response till this moment.
@ifitweremydream @SecPompeo @StateDept individuals’ actions don’t represent the country’s values so your suggestion is meaningless.
@SecPompeo @StateDept they’ll be subject to trial in #SaudiArabia, and @KingSalman won’t allow those who involved in #khashoogi death to escape the consequences.
@TulsiPress I really appreciate your efforts but you’re making a negative decisions in related to foreign affairs!	in #Yemen, #Saudi Arabia tries to protect its land and saves Yemenis from Houthis militants.
@MarkRuffalo @SpeakerRyan @RepRoKhanna @repmarkpocan they allied with Iranian regime that seek to develop nuclear weapons to use it against United States!!	don’t you see it!!
@MarkRuffalo @SpeakerRyan @RepRoKhanna @repmarkpocan you live in Hollywood but you know nothing about #yemen, do you have any idea what Houthis are doing there?? they killed their brothers and sisters and went against their own government.
@RandPaul so #SaudiArabia is the reason why you united again!! I thought issues that matter to Americans will make you work together 💔
@NRC_Egeland Houthis blocked every way to give medical aids to Yemenis, and that includes cholera medicine!!
@washingtonpost #SaudiArabia has told the world that it’ll reveal the facts about #khashoogi mysterious death and now it announced the results and held the killers accountable.
@washingtonpost this’s justice 👏🏼 a country that arrests its individuals and punished them for making a mistake is a country that deserves the respect.
@AP I guess #Turkey is looking for more than establishing justice!! is it asking for more death penalty? #SaudiArabia is acting based on Islamic laws and I’m pretty sure #Turkey is fully aware of that.
@AP #Turkey wants to act like if it was its business, I really don’t know why it keep hiding evidence and refuse to cooperate with #Saudi’s intelligence!!
@Reuters and #SaudiArabia proves once again that it’ll not allow such stupid actions to happen, that’s why it’ll execute those killers.
@RandPaul you’ve disappointed all of us senator, I thought you’d find a solution to Houthis’ present in #Yemen but I guess your feelings toward #SaudiArabia blinded you to do the right thing.
@RandPaul is this your way to show us how you stand up for justice? what about Iranian regime’s operations in #Yemen?
@RandPaul your vote will help Iranian regime to extend their operations in region and do whatever they want to make sure they’re controlling Middle East.
@RandPaul you can stand up for innocent life and speak out against humanitarian tragedy when you condemn Houthis who caused the destruction in #Yemen
@NBCNews @NBCNightlyNews when will #Turkey release everything it has and give it to #SaudiArabia to carry on its investigation?? #Turkey tries to ruin the #Saudi investigation
@MiddleEastEye what a funny report you have 😄	do you think anyone would believe your shit??
@NegarMortazavi @AmnestyNow is this how Amnesty treat official consulates?? wow @amnesty you went to the bottom.
@John_Hudson first, I’m sure both newspapers never listened to the mysterious audio tapes. 	second, mr. Bolton has listened to thee recordings and as he said there’s nothing refers to MBS as media claimed.
@John_Hudson why they linked the word “boss” to #Saudi Crown Prince?? is he their target from the beginning?
@RoKhanna I really don’t know why you keep blaming #Saudi Arabia for the tragedies in #Yemen!!! they’re helping there.
@RoKhanna #Yemen’s crisis was caused by Houthis and their supporter (Iranian regime). 	don’t blame #SaudiArabia because it’s protecting its borders and joined the battle because the Yemeni government asked for it.
@RoKhanna what about establishing a resolution that seek to start a war against Iranian regime? then you’ll save millions of innocents people in #Iran and region.
@RoKhanna we all care about our safety which means that US must keep its support in #Yemen in order to protect Yemenis from Houthis’ violence.
@thehill so he mean #Iran doesn’t pose a danger to the world? is he really thinking of our safety and security?
@thehill #SaudiArabia is NOT a public subject for you guys to talk about in your daily life!! quit it and do your job.
@AhmadAlgohbary you need to be the spokesman for Houthis, then we can describe you as the terrorism’s big mouth.
@AJENews US senators should fix their society and start with ban carrying weapons in the streets.
@codepink what about providing a resolution to condemn Iranian regime’s and Houthis’ actions in #Yemen which brought the country into chaos.

@Reuters mr. @RT_Erdogan has become a journalist now lol 😄 he should quit his position as president because he failed.
@NBCNews but why didn’t he release the tapes or give them to #SaudiArabia from the beginning? why did he insist to hide them??
@AJEnglish it’s not your job to know what was in their suitcases, #SaudiArabia will answer all these questions later right after it finishes investigation with suspects.
@JZarif @SecPompeo you’re the last person who’s the right to talk about justice!! don’t you realize your position here?? you’re the FM of the biggest sponsor country of terrorism.
@JZarif @SecPompeo US never threatened Iranians people who seek to see a change in their future lives.
@cnni then he didn’t listen to those mysterious tapes!!
@DerbyChrisW @FabianLeedsNE UK blocked all attempts to bring peace in #Yemen???????	are you out of your mind? don’t you see who’s ruining the peace attempts?	if you never heard of Iranian regime or Houthis then i won’t blame you for your ignorance.
@julianbarnes did you hear the recordings? #France itself denied it received the tapes from #Turkey and accused @RT_Erdogan that he plays a dirty political game in this case.
@taslimanasreen you’re wrong and I don’t know from where you heard this rumors!! I assure you that #SaudiArabia is welcoming everyone from all nationalities and religions.
@KarenAttiah @Twitter @saudq1978 of course not but you try to make it his fault because of his influence in #Qatar crisis 	you know how #Qatar was harmed so bad because he exposed the true face of Qatari regime.
@KarenAttiah @Twitter @saudq1978 how did you link him with #khashoogi death? was he in #Turkey? was #SaudiArabia announce its final results of investigation?
@AJEnglish when you guys learn how to write an exclusive report? #Qatar is paying for those reporters in @washingtonpost &amp; @nytimes and you copy their articles even if it all faked?
@ColinKahl believe or not it’s up to you, sometimes facts bother us but we should eventually accept them. 	#Saudi Crown Prince has nothing to do with #khashoogi death but you guys want to blame him.

@AJENews it’s so important to change the regime of #Iran, in sake of the world’s security.
@AJEnglish she’s a Qatari agent, her actions prove that she hides something relevant to #Khashoggi death.
@KenRoth if #Turkey and @RT_Erdogan have more evidence, they should share them with #SaudiArabia not others.
@KenRoth why you insist that those arms deals are the reason of what’s happening to #Yemen? why don’t you call the leaders and organizations to condemn Iranian regime who supports Houthis there!!
@KenRoth but #France FM has denied that #Turkey gave those so-called tapes to it!!		https://t.co/1jTB6qwyCQ
@KenRoth why wouldn’t #Turkey and @RT_Erdogan release the tapes that they claimed they had??
@KenRoth you should believe it because #SaudiArabia doesn’t agree to such things happen to its own citizens.

@SenBlumenthal are you ready to impose sanctions on #SaudiArabia and throw the historical relationship between the two countries away just because you didn’t think of future of the relationship?

@SenBlumenthal it’s an investigation nor condemnation, not all of those 18 ppl are guilty until we see the final results of the investigation.
@CarolineLucas the Yemeni government has asked #SaudiArabia to give a helping hand, then terrorists attacked #Saudi cities which means that #SaudiArabia has the right to protect itself from any danger.
@CarolineLucas media is giving false facts about the reality, #SaudiArabia will hold #Khashoogi killers accountable and punish them. 	in #Yemen, #Saudi-led coalition is supporting the Yemeni legitimate government to retake control of its territories.
@margheritamvs because the Saudi members sent their reports says #Khashoggi has left the consulate, which was unlike the Turkish’s reports. 	then #SaudiArabia decided to create a joint team with #Turkey to reveal the truth.

Schumer, you’re a wise man and aware of how important the historical relationship between United States and #SaudiArabia. 	you know very well what’s happening in #Yemen and the Iranian regime’s role there. 	don’t ignore that #Saudi Arabia is doing its best to secure ME.
@SenJackReed you’re accusing an ally without having evidence, you’re risking your reputation and ties with #SaudiArabia for claims which are not true.
@summer_said @Ola_Salem @saudq1978 @SAFCSP so what? he might be under investigation now but that doesn’t mean he’s guilty of #Khashoggi death. 		focus guys.
@VaughanPappy @My_Own_Opinions @cafreeland do you have a problem with his/her freedom of expression? @My_Own_Opinions expressed his thoughts and did nothing wrong or asked @cafreeland to shut up!!
@cafreeland you can take about the tragedy accident that hurts all Saudis but you cannot interfere in the internal investigation.
@cafreeland without your calls, #SaudiArabia is going to bring all who’re responsible for #Khashoggi death to justice and hold them accountable according to Saudi’s laws.
#SaudiArabia is a country of justice and no one cares about #Saudi citizens more than @KingSalman or his Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. https://t.co/15LY7WTobD
@John_Hudson it’s the @washingtonpost 😄	they’re trying to create any story to steal the spotlight but as always it’ll fail.
@KenRoth do you say that #SaudiArabia is lying about what happened to #khashoogi? do you realize what you’re saying here??		stop accusing others who’re not involved in this case.
@RandPaul I don’t advise you to do that if you care about the security of the world!!	Iranian regime is waiting this moment to happen to extend its influence in #Yemen.
@RandPaul be careful mr. Paul, stopping the US participation in #Yemen will leave a remarkable impact on Middle East and #Iran will use that for its own interests.
@RandPaul why do you describe it as unacceptable? don’t forget that #Khashoggi was and still a #saudi citizen and the Saudi authorities said they’ll reveal all facts about his death.
@deenainalex @aliShihabi Saudi person died, his killer or killers will hold accountable, then why are you so upset?
@KarenAttiah the statement was so clear, they went to #Turkey to talk to him as he requested (#Khashooggi), the situation went wrong and tried to cover it up. 	they did a mistake and #SaudiArabia will hold them accountable for it.
@timkaine you’re trying to make the situation like if #Khashoggi is an American citizen! come on!!		you lost the election to @realDonaldTrump who values the relationship with #SaudiArabia 		put your feelings out of the case.
@margheritamvs it lost nothing as long as it was honest and clear with everyone. 	those who caused the death of #khashoggi and tried to cover it up will bring to justice as soon as possible.
@margheritamvs @WSJ acknowledged that after it received the first results of its investigation, which does make sense because it has no idea of what happened there.
RT @aliShihabi: BTW senior sources also confirmed to me that the famous "bone-saw" NEVER existed and was purely a product of Turkish media…
@astroehlein you’re an ignorant person, you want to blame #SaudiArabia for #Khashoggi death whatsoever. 	relax, you won’t do anything if you wasn’t paid to say those claims.
@astroehlein do you think you can figure out what happened without investigation? 😏😂	be reasonable dude. 	they’ve investigated and concluded that there’re 18 suspects, and that’s doesn’t mean they all fought him.
@TheBeatWithAri @AymanM anyone involved in that incident will hold accountable for what happened. 	#SaudiArabia will make sure justice is going to be done.
@SenBobCorker isn’t #khashoogi a #Saudi citizen?? why would you call for investigation?	if you don’t like #SaudiArabia then don’t let your feelings interfere your job.
@SenBobCorker they told the world that they don’t know anything, and started their investigation which concluded to the preliminary results that announced the death of #Khashoggi. 	the investigation is on.
@GormanJay @RandPaul @jaketapper you’re mixing everything up, arms sales are there to protect the region from Iranian regime’s aggression. 	the world felt empathy after 9/11 incident, which #Iran planned that operation.
@RandPaul #SaudiArabia respects all international laws that protect human rights &amp; nations as well. 	in #Khashoggi case, it reassures the world that it’ll bring those responsible of his death to justice.
@RandPaul and that may serve your agendas as well 😏. 	I guess one day you’ll blame #Saudis for the extinction of dinosaurs, not only #Khashoggi death.
you cannot cut the ties to get answers, this’s wrong. 	#SaudiArabia is sharing all information with all concerned parties. https://t.co/dh3YpZ2xZu
@RepMikeCoffman do you think you’re more caring about Saudi’s affairs and international human rights? you’re wrong mr. Coffman. 	#SaudiArabia since day one has started looking at the case of #khashoggi disappearance and now it announced the first results of the internal investigation.
you can see his plan in his last tweet, it isn’t about #khashoogi, it’s about his thoughts toward #Iran and Houthis who tried to take over #Yemen. https://t.co/tHNrn1vygO
@ChrisCoons okey this’s your goal from the beginning, you want to stop arms deals, to stop supporting #SaudiArabia to save #Yemen, so it isn’t about America’s values in the first place.
@ChrisCoons not credible? what do you want them to say!! they didn’t hide or lied about anything and they tell the world the preliminary results.
@ChrisCoons how didn’t you conclude that while you don’t have all evidence!
RT @_Malik550: @ChrisCoons every country has almost the same values, you’re not different at all. 	shall I remind you about #Guantanamo pri…
@ChrisCoons every country has almost the same values, you’re not different at all. 	shall I remind you about #Guantanamo prison? the place when U.S. was torturing prisoners to death, ignoring all human rights!!
@ChrisCoons he’s a #Saudi citizen who fought with Saudi man in a Saudi consulate, which is being investigated by Saudi authorities, I don’t see why you’re talking about free speech or human rights.
@sfahey_imp @RepTedDeutch #SaudiArabia cares more than anyone else about its citizens, that’s why it formed an investigation team to clarify the truth.
@RepTedDeutch the #Saudi statement announced that the investigation isn’t over yet, it’s preliminary results and it didn’t say who really killed #Khashoggi
@John_Hudson if Washington did that and it won’t for sure, #SaudiArabia will have to buy its weapons from others like Russia, it’s its right to protect itself.
@AP ooh so @anadoluagency announces that he’s disappeared nor murdered! 😄😏	I guess their anonymous source has mixed everything up.
@AP it’s a normal procedure in investigation, you need to question everyone including Saudis and Turks.
@chrislhayes if he’s murder, then where’s his body? tell us where is it?	you know he’s missing, I know he’s missing, the whole world knows that he’s missing. 	so stop your games.
@AJEnglish @baysontheroad @UN what do you want him to say?? investigation isn’t over yet and if you acted professional you wouldn’t ask him such a thing.
@MoDualeh @sobiazia @KenRoth @kbsalsaud I’m a journalist and I take my job seriously, I won’t accuse anyone without evidence, I won’t do the same as those idiots who write based on who pays more.
@Joyce_Karam ABC is misleading its audiences, it lost its credibility and the people’s trust just because it published fake news. 		@POTUS was right about #FakeNews
@Joyce_Karam which means either #Turkey is lying to us, or it has the audio tapes but not against #saudiarabia

@MoDualeh @sobiazia @KenRoth @kbsalsaud or maybe you deleted your tweets because you received money for the first time which blinded you to see the truth 😏 I’m wondering is it #Qatar or #Iran?
@realDonaldTrump we’re sure #SaudiArabia has nothing to do with @JKhashoggi disappearance. 	#Turkey must provide the evidence it has or apologize to #Saudis for the claims it published.
@KenRoth why you insist that he’s behind @JKhashoggi disappearance?	I can think of one reason that make you keep doing this and that because the money you receive from specific countries.
@funder where’re those audio tapes? why we hear a lot of fake leaks but nothing about the tapes?	I guess there’re no tapes and Turkish authorities are in trouble.
@AJEnglish isn’t Joe Biden the guy who supported #Qatari and Iranian regimes to expand their funding to terrorism?
@sobiazia @KenRoth FYI, he went also to #Saudi consulate in Washington before and met the Saudi ambassador @kbsalsaud there. 	if #SaudiArabia wanted to arrest him, it could do that so easily before so don’t believe those rumors.
@KenRoth is that your way to tell the world how to respect human rights while you’re insulting the #Saudi Crown Prince?		shame on you.
@sitinanu @AJEnglish using innocents and children as shields is a crime too, but I don’t see you so upset about that, actually you didn’t condemn Houthis in your tweets.
@AJEnglish are you waiting him to say #Saudi forces never make mistakes!! okey we all hope to reach this level of professionalism, but again mistakes happen everywhere.
@tburages @KCDurling @LGHelebra @MarcucciMatt @MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump so what!! can’t the son practice his own hobbies??? you’re pathetic. 	next time when you wanna play the investigator role, please bring some evidence.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump you again are repeating the same lie that US &amp; Saudis denied months ago. 	I really don’t know how come you guys believe everything you read.
@DomaLady @HLaverdiereNPD @JustinTrudeau yeah and let #Iran the new member?? be reasonable.
@HLaverdiereNPD @JustinTrudeau do you think it’s the best solution? do you realize how dangerous is the Iranian regime if the world allowed it to extend its influence in Middle East? are you ready to take the responsibility of your decision?
@toomadj @tutatt @KenRoth @liamcunningham1 you people are idiots 😄 how do you want #SaudiArabia to show you the body while it reassures that @JKhashoggi left its consulate?? https://t.co/Hh0HtRBKly
@KenRoth okey then ask #turkey to release its audio tapes, if it really has them.
@miss9afi @realDonaldTrump isn’t he spending his sentence based on #Saudi laws? so how come you asked foreign people to interfere in Saudi Arabia’s internal affairs to release your husband?
@SenToddYoung @SenatorShaheen @washingtonpost so you already made @JKhashoggi a dead person!! where’s his body or the evidence that proves his death??	is so then based on what you accuse #SaudiArabia of his death as you claimed??
@RandPaul then you intend to interfere in #Saudi’s internal affairs!!! is this your principal of respecting others’ sovereignty?
@rulajebreal @JKhashoggi @chrislhayes @allinwithchris so you moved from kidnapping and murdering allegations into accusing @POTUS to use his position for his own interests!! 	no comments.
I’ll tell you why, because the Qataris media is leading this case and misleading the whole world. 	while in #Yemen, #Qatar can’t cover Iranian regime’s or Houthis’ war crimes. https://t.co/E5f6a9SFE5
@KenRoth his murder? no one proves that till this moment so how come you know this information and being sure?
@shaneharris take a side please, his death or disappearance? 😄🤔	don’t play the words and act like an idiot.
@RepAdamSchiff the truth will expose itself soon and we shouldn’t jump to false conclusions that’ll affect international security.
@EihabAD @KenRoth if investigation didn’t prove anything then the student is innocent.
@KenRoth as @POTUS said: “#SaudiArabia is innocent until investigation proves the opposite”. 	be careful about your speeches mr. Roth.
@manal_alsharif @KarenAttiah @washingtonpost this’s a fake account created by @AJENews @AJEnglish, you can see that by following the qataris tweets.
@KarenAttiah @manal_alsharif US itself denied that, how come you tell they knew something didn’t happen?
@manal_alsharif @JKhashoggi are you the anonymous source who Turkish authorities hides? 😄	I hope you’re satisfied with your false opinions you spread via twitter.
@WSJ he’s a true leader and that’s why he became the president 👍🏼. 	the leader should not take any action without thinking about consequences.
@nytimes you’re reporting your news from local unknown Turkish  agencies 🤥🤔	you’re not sure if these rumors are true or fake, so don’t risk your credibility and put it in line because of that.
@KenRoth “reportedly” is the magic words to spread lies.
@SheilaKhani @NegarMortazavi again you need to have permission or your plane will be a target by Turkish Air Forces.
it’s really disgusting when you see the media spreading rumors by the name of officials while in fact no ones are making any statements.
this proves nothing unless they show the evidence they’ve found. 	I really don’t know why everybody publish their news with no mention of names, everyone says “reportedly, official, etc...” https://t.co/9F4CTcWQ4P
@SheilaKhani @NegarMortazavi your source please?!	FYI, no one can leave a country by a private jet without having permission to takeoff.
@NegarMortazavi wow what a fantastic story 😄 	everyday we see some exclusive news from unknown sources that are totally opposite of officials say 😂.
@NegarMortazavi you said he was murdered in the consul’s office, but #Turkey didn’t find evidence there when it searched the place. 		then why didn’t Turkish authorities release the audios they talk about lately?
@ProdMichelle @FoxNews @RandPaul those 15 you mentioned were Saudis but they were trained and lived in #Iran.
@FoxNews @RandPaul your opinions mr. senator are dangerous and risk the future of U.S. so please be wiser and think of America’s interests.
@FoxNews @RandPaul I’m glad you’re not the president, otherwise U.S. will be isolated with no allies at all.
@Bahadiman @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight stop saying things which don’t make any sense at all. 	since when a country is controlling the United States??
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @foxnewsnight so you’re annoyed because @POTUS is defending his ally while there’s no evidence to deny #SaudiArabia?	I’m so disappointed that you’re a senator.
@astroehlein they’re the real killers you look for. 	#Saudis are buying weapons to protect itself and #Yemen from the danger of #Iran. 	so cut your crap and condemn Iran for its actions.
@astroehlein really? is that what concerns you?	don’t you care about the real problem in #Yemen? look at what Iranian regime is doing there!! they’re supporting terrorists who target civilians there.
@nytimes #SaudiArabia didn’t threaten U.S.  directly, it said it will act if a country decides to sanction #Saudi because of allegations.
@AP which evidence exactly because Turkish authorities didn’t say they found something supporting all claims of @JKhashoggi death.
@realDonaldTrump you’re the president of the United States of America, it’s so obvious you cut all of your ties with your own business. 	ignore those people who spread rumors to force their opinions on you.
@ChrisMurphyCT leave your differences with #SaudiArabia aside and do your job.
@ChrisMurphyCT you talk about your president like you were better than him 😂😪 wake up. 	look around and you’ll see the lies made by anti-Saudi media.
@SenSanders if you do so, and you succeeded, you’ll destroy every single hope of all Yemenis who dreamed of seeing their country’s future again.
@SenSanders #Iran was and still dangerous to the world’s security. 	if Iranian regime continues its brutal actions in #Yemen, then I don’t think we’ll see any future there.
@SenSanders you’re very aware of how important the relationship between U.S. &amp; Saudi Arabia, you also are very aware that what’s happening in #Yemen isn’t #Saudi-led coalition’s fault.
@nadaburger @LouiseMensch @PhilipRucker @20committee @MrFelt_ @911CORLEBRA777 and why did you assume that he’s dead or killed by Saudis?	didn’t you think that Qataris maybe took him and created this story and MAYBE they’ll kill him later to cover their dirty hands?
@PhilipRucker he meant that @JKhashoggi may be killed after he left the consulate by unknown killers. 	maybe they were from #Iran or brotherhood group.
@RoKhanna #Saudi-led coalition never targeted civilians on purpose, in fact Houthis are using them as their human shields to protect themselves. 	you must condemn them for their cowardly actions toward Yemenis.
@RoKhanna you can achieve peace by stopping the Iranian regime and Houthi forces who seek to destroy #Yemen and destabilize the Middle East.
@AJENews and tell me how did your anonymous source get the AUDIO you mentioned? 😏🤥
@NickKristof did @SecPompeo told you that? or you’re guessing?	if none then you’re unprofessional reporter who takes his job so recklessly.
@JRubinBlogger @abbydphillip if you concluded that, then you’re an idiot who doesn’t care about consequences at all.
@abbydphillip he’s totally right about that 😌👍🏼. 	you cannot accused others without having evidence, and doing so will lead to cutting ties that harm everyone.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth @realDonaldTrump #Islam is aiming to crush all other religions? who says that?	let me enlighten you a little bit, Islam is the religion of peace which calls for all people to love and forgive. 	those extremists don’t represent Islam in any aspect at all.
@ragipsoylu and you think they’ll hide @JKhashoggi inside a laptop bag? 😏😂	please stop misleading the people!!	I guess if you saw @RT_Erdogan enter the consulate, you’ll say he’s a part of the scenario. 😂
@andrewrsorkin murder 😪🤥. 	did #Turkey, #SaudiArabia or even #US announced his death? 	please stop manipulating the people’s feelings and thoughts.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth there’s nothing impossible, no one thought @realDonaldTrump will keep his promise and be a president. 	Middle East has its chance to change only if the Iranian regime stops its aggressive policies in region.
@KenRoth it’s a shame to be a senior human rights activist while you manipulating people who look at you as the savior.
@KenRoth wow you sure are annoyed because of #SaudiArabia or maybe because you got blinded by money that you no longer can see the truth.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth again you’re not funny at all. 	this’s a real situation where countries may enter new different &amp; difficult era.
@TitanicQueen @KenRoth are you trying to be funny? 	you failed my friend, don’t involve yourself in this situation.
@MusimIh @KenRoth @toadbaiter there’s no way you can compare Iranian regime with another country or organization 😄	@khamenei_ir is standing above all devils.
@SAJ_FREE_SPIRIT @KenRoth pro-terrorism 🤥 https://t.co/WSTD3iJihU
@KenRoth you try to mention #SaudiArabia in all of your tweets to show your idiotic opinions. 	you must be a fair person as long as you represent human rights organization.
@KenRoth seriously?? do you hear yourself??	the apple’s watch cannot recording anything 😂😏. 	stop creating lies.
@PressTV 😂😂	I really don’t know what to say 😂	do you think others will believe this!
@PressTV this’s true, US isn’t a dumb state like #iran. 	#Trump cares about the US-Saudi relationship.
@PressTV lies lies lies 🤥	you people cannot publish one true news in your agency.
@AJEnglish but you don’t know if he’s dead or not, unless your regime has killed him already.
@UnfilteredSE @RepKinzinger @secupp you cannot cut all relationships with your ally because you heard some untrue rumors and reports.
@BBCPolitics @EmilyThornberry she’s against #SaudiArabia in the first place, so it’s normal to condemn Saudis for @JKhashoggi’s disappearance because she’s interests in doing so.
@m3takl_en what’s your source? be a professional and tell the world about your tweets’ sources in order to believe you.
@BachirBelmehdi @ianbremmer @JKhashoggi yeah on the moon and I see you very clear from here. 	stop being an idiot, I asked him one clear question and if you’ve an opinion you’re welcome to enlighten me.
@ragipsoylu did the statement mentioned @POTUS? or USA? 	stop misleading people to achieve your goals.
@RichardHaass you insist to accuse #SaudiArabia of killing @JKhashoggi with no single evidence, that doesn’t make any sense at all.
@ianbremmer how could you be so sure that #SaudiArabia has killed @JKhashoggi? 	no single official from #Turkey or #UnitedStates has announced that Saudis did it.
@RichardHaass aren’t you supposed to be wise and not judging others before investigators ended their job???

@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS is the president, he’s not like you guys accusing others with no proof. 	you’re attacking him because he did things that don’t suit your agendas.

@BazziNYU @TheAtlantic did #SaudiArabia kidnap @JKhashoggi? I don’t see any official saying that.
@iLayth @FinancialTimes @astroehlein do you hear yourself? #Turkey itself didn’t accuse #SaudiArabia till this moment which means there’s something wrong behind these fake reports we heard last days.
@FinancialTimes it’s gonna be a stupid move if they quit their relationship with #SaudiArabia just because they believed fake reports.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi this’s your problem, you believe whatever the media agencies said because they’re getting paid to publish what their clients want.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi are you kidding me? 😂	two planes and black vans don’t prove anything 😂😂	how can you prove those covered-faces are Saudis? did the Turkish authorities announced that? of course not.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi 1. which report you say? one Saudi consul in #Turkey has said that, and I gave you a specific name, not anonymous one as you do😏	2. yeah I wanna see the thugs arriving and leaving. show me videos.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi @JKhashoggi + he’s a Saudi citizen who was trialed by a Saudi court based on some Saudi laws’ violations. 	it’s 100% a Saudi’s business, not others’.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi @JKhashoggi I know what does takfiri means, no need to show me what you’ve memorized. 	mr. Badawi has his trial with his lawyer by his side and the court made its final decision -10 years in prison with lashing-.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu sorry I meant to punish the guys who deserve it. 	we don’t like torturing as well. so it’s simple, if you violated a law you’ll be punished.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi you’re repeating the same shit with no meaning 😄	again, I advise you to stop your whatever you do now because who’s ever paying you is for sure a part of @JKhashoggi ‘s disappearance.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi as per the many reports, @JKhashoggi has left the consulate and none was murder inside it. 		I can do the same as you do, depending on unknown sources.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi then show me the video types.
@PressTV do you want them to accuse #SaudiArabia for everything? is that your wish? 	you guys are pathetic.
@t_morrin @JKhashoggi Q. another one, where’s his body if he was killed inside the #Saudi consulate as you guys claimed? you can’t hide a body so easily especially when the eyes of the world is watching you.
@t_morrin Q. why didn’t Turkish authorities release video tapes of those 15 men, who claimed to killed @JKhashoggi, when they arrived and left the consulate?
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi I don’t see names here 👀 didn’t you find one?
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu too big difference between torturing innocent and torturing someone who deserves it. 	don’t try to turn the table off because you’ll always fail 😏.
I’m talking about something specific, and this guy is repeating what his Qatari employer says 😂😄. 	those guys are something else lol. https://t.co/FeVvr6x5yW
@MasihullahHasan @Qattouby @MustaAlmadani @Sabah Saudis don’t use their second names to represent themselves 😏	try harder next time.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi give me one name of senior official of one of the world’s countries says that #SaudiArabia is a takfiri state, except Iranian regime’s men of course.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu whipping exists in #Quran, it’s better than killing someone especially those who admitted their mistakes. 	so again stop making things look like what you want.

@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu he violated the #Saudi laws and abused the  #Islam religion. 	he’s aware of his mistakes and the government turned from executing him into whiplashing &amp; prisoning him.
@jeetytweety @AJENews unfortunately, Saudis aren’t fools as you think, they’re loyal to their government, not like those who #Qatar hires them for suspicious business.
@estechlin @AJENews guilty of what exactly? you people accused him with no signal evidence.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu @miss9afi never said her husband is being tortured in prison, she only demands for releasing him. 	I advise you to reconsider your opinions before you claim fake things.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu don’t give me names and claim that they’re tortured and beaten up with no evidence. 	anyone can write a report and say whatever he or she wants as long as this report brings money.
@AJENews what a funny story you guys wrote 🤥	aren’t you going to say that his body was burned to ashes or they ate him!! 😂
@hisham_melhem @JKhashoggi @washingtonpost used this story for its own interests, and idiots like you were fooled so easily, even though all Saudi’s affairs’ are what made #Qatar pays your salary.
@Ola_Salem @LovedayM @smekhennet @kfahim we need names, not unknown sources or anonymous people familiar with the investigation. 	i doubt that there’s true sources behind this story.
@Qattouby @ragipsoylu @JKhashoggi I don’t see him wearing the uniform 😏 I guess it’s a random pics you found them on website.
@Qattouby @MustaAlmadani @Sabah account’s name and picture’s name is so different 😂😪 who’re you trying to fool?
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu the whole world is watching, and #SaudiArabia will never harm or threaten one of its citizens. 	so stop claiming things that don’t exist.
@ahmedbinrashid6 @ShafikFM those who’re in #Ritz also had secret trials and now they’re free. 	don’t be a fool.
@m3takl_en so basically your claims are fake 100%. 	the truth will rise soon and we’ll see who’s behind this scenario.
@m3takl_en if he thought he’ll be investigated if he come back, that means he admitted his mistakes. 	but he used to visit #Saudi’s consulates and embassies in #UnitedStates &amp; #Turkey and never said he was banned to enter them or being arrested.
@t_morrin @Ahmet_Davutoglu which people you mean? that women who pretend to be his fiancée?	his family denied that, and she has some links to #Qatari government which means that #Qatar is playing a role in this scenario.
@EMAW_GT @MailOnline I really want to know this anonymous source that nobody knows 😂💔.
@AP #Saudi authority has announced it’ll open its consulate’s doors and cooperate with local authorities to reveal the mystery of @JKhashoggi’s sudden disappearance.
@rosemaryhopkin @MailOnline mr. Kashoggi is a Saudi citizen, and if #SaudiArabia wanted to investigate him, it could easily ask #Turkey to cooperate with it. 	so there’s no truth behind these rumors that Carmen from anonymous source as media said.
@MailOnline cut into pieces?? sure about that?	you need to be a professional media, not to spread lies.
@Ahmet_Davutoglu which freedom you’re talking about? is it the same freedom when @RT_Erdogan suppressed all of peaceful rallies and arrested all of his competitors? not to mention the shutdown of newspapers and other media stations.
@Ahmet_Davutoglu I don’t think #Turkey is currently in its best times while its economy is collapsing and feeds by #Qatar’s money. 	it won’t be a surprise if investigation shows that your country helped Qatari agents to create this scenario.
@Ahmet_Davutoglu they already told you that he came and finished his business and went out of the building. 	also #SaudiArabia sent a team of investigators to cooperate with #Turkey’s authorities to reveal the truth behind his sudden disappearance.
@Reuters #SaudiArabia has given the Turkish authority the green light to search inside its consulate as @Reuters did. 	#Saudi Arabia care about its citizens’ safety and will do its best to cooperate with #Turkey to find him.
@RoKhanna why do you insist that #Saudi-led coalition attack civilians on purpose? for your information, Houthis are using them to cover themselves, they hide among Yemenis citizens and launching their operations from there.
@KenRoth don’t manipulating by using different words, you mean the women who were in contact with foreign states and provided to them sensitive information 😏	yeah don’t involve the real #Saudi women who love their country and will never ever do something stupid to harm their home.
@ShafikFM @ahmedbinrashid6 I’m pretty sure that @AlJazeera is paying you a lot of money as long as you’re working with them, you’ve no credibility at all.
@ShafikFM @ahmedbinrashid6 this’s your reply? if I disagreed with you then you’ll accuse me of being paid? trust me not all people are being paid as you.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BobCorker @BenCardinforMD so you’d believe some reports from anonymous sources rather than believe #Saudi officials??
@LindseyGrahamSC @BobCorker @BenCardinforMD okey Senator, do you really believe that #SaudiArabia will kidnap #Saudi citizen who came to finish some business??? into-Saudi media did their best to spread this fake story.
@ahmedbinrashid6 @ShafikFM no one disappeared, the #Saudi authority has announced that they’re being investigated.
@ShafikFM are you whining because they said the truth that you cannot denied?
@kennyloza_no @KenRoth you’re so sure that he was killed!! did @Reuters find his body as you claimed?
@KenRoth I can see that your recent tweets are all about @JKhashoggi’s disappearance, I’m pretty much sure that your account is receiving too much checks.
@KenRoth based on what you say that he’s been killed by #SaudiArabia? did you see his body or a photo of it? did someone acknowledge that? 	if you want to make a story, please don’t use people’s feelings.
@KenRoth take a side, once you say he’s murdered, and in other tweet you say he’s disappeared or kidnapped!!!	can you please tell us what’re your final thoughts?
@chikogeorge1 @KenRoth @MachangolhiDhek wow, your opinions must be published everywhere, in fact you must write a book to enlighten your likes. 😂
@KenRoth why’d #SaudiArabia bother itself to kill him in the first place? because there’s no truth behind this claim. 	so stop creating fake stories and help the authorities to find him.
@KenRoth he entered and left the #Saudi consulate, he’s been going to other #Saudi consulates around the world and no one arrested or stopped him.
@AhmadAlgohbary then enlighten us with your intelligence, where’s his body if he’s dead?
@waltshaub U.S. administration knows very well what’s best for its interests and people, don’t make things look too bad just because you disagree with them.
@AJEnglish and Turkish authorities have no idea about this certain news 😂	next time when you want to spread fake news, try harder and cover it well.
@MiddleEastEye Ooh so now the same source told your agency about this exclusive news!! the same source who told @washingtonpost and @Reuters!!!	it’s obvious now that there’s unknown organization works secretly to blame Saudis.
@jrezaian but no Turkish officials confirmed this report of @washingtonpost!!!	I really don’t know why such a journal news insist to accuse #SaudiArabia of his disappearance and now of his fake death???
@ChrisMurphyCT #Saudi official denied this fake report of @washingtonpost and @Reuters 	make sure of your sources before claiming false things that will harm the relationship between the two countries.
@RepTedDeutch @washingtonpost too much rumors say that Qatar’s involved in his disappearance, I think it’s their new way to embarrass #SaudiArabia.
@ChrisCoons you talk like they kidnapped him and took him to unknown place. 	#Turkey is looking for #Gulen who hides in United States, why don’t you verify his location!?
@tomfriedman #turkish and #saudi security forces are searching for him at this moment and no one heard anything about him since he left the #Saudi consulate.
@KenRoth whatever he describes himself, he’ll be considered as the great reformist who cut all ways for introducer to interfere in #Saudi’s society and affairs.
@NickKristof @washingtonpost based on what you accused #saudiarabia to kidnap a #saudi journalist? he entered the consulate and no one banned him, in fact he was welcomed, then he left the place.
@KenRoth maybe he’s sitting on his office at Qatari consulate.
@shepelutca @Shahnameh_ @SaraMassoumi @mehdirhasan @AJUpFront what about interview with the brutal dictators of Iranian regime @khamenei_ir and @HassanRouhani !! I wanna see them talk about their obsession with wars and chaos.
@mehdirhasan @AJUpFront regime of #Iran has committed war crimes and no one tried to stop them except @POTUS who faced struggles from #EU leaders.
@KenRoth wherever #Iran involves, there’ll be no peace or end of conflicts. 	the regime is obsessed with blood, destruction, and chaos.
@KenRoth keep in mind that #SaudiArabia has many enemies like #Iran and #Qatar who’re willing to do anything to harm #Saudi Arabia.
@KenRoth the consulate itself told the media that he left its building immediately after he finished his business, why do you accuse #SaudiArabia of his disappearance?
@JZarif do you really think that Arab countries will cooperate with your regime? your regime is seeking to spread destruction and chaos in all over the Middle East and you call to cooperate!!!
@carlbildt and #SaudiArabia told press that he left the consulate, and it’ll cooperate with Turkish security forces to search for him.
@AJENews maybe he went the the Qatari consulate and disappeared 🤔 it’s possible when we think of it.
@khamenei_ir instead of tweeting, try to fix your regime that damaged your economy, Iranians deserve a better future for themselves and their children.
@khamenei_ir it’s not the US administration who’ll change your regime, true Iranians are. 	your regime will soon fall from the inside, Iranian people will do it to make the country as it should be.

@barbaraslavin1 @tparsi fight? I don’t see any fight over there. 	#SaudiArabia doesn’t want any relationship with #Qatar, that’s all. 	it’s nobody’s business to interfere.
@tparsi both #Qatar and Iranian regime have used their resources to support terrorists who targeted innocents people from all over the world.
@tparsi first, they both have historical relationships in allying and supporting each other. second, why would US use its influence to ask #SaudiArabia to stop something doesn’t exist?	the only two countries in region that funding terrorism are #Qatar &amp; #Iran.

@EverettColdwell you can’t stop the civil war of #Yemen as long as the regime of #Iran keeps providing weapons and missiles to Houthis to target the legitimate government and Yemenis.
@thehill the regime’s officials ruined all Iranians’ lives when they came in power.
@PressTV seriously!! the regime was and still the source of all destruction and chaos in the Middle East.
@AJEnglish it doesn’t matter how many times #Qatar denies its involvement in supporting terrorists, the world knows the truth and will isolate it soon.
@AhmadAlgohbary liar 🤥 	no one targets children of #Yemen but Houthis militants, your friends did that. 	you should be ashamed of yourself to cover up their crimes.
@RoKhanna Yemenis have suffered till this day because of Houthis’s brutal actions in #Yemen, who have Iranian regime’s support. 	you’re hypocrite for sure.
@RoKhanna why didn’t say that we should stop #Iran? you always focus on #SaudiArabia even though your country knows that Iranian regime is the threat here.
@hs88_hs88 @RoKhanna @SocialistProf you see the picture from wrong side, those countries know how dangerous Iranian regime is, if it controlled the country then Middle East will lose its stability.
@RoKhanna until Iranian regime &amp; Houthis militants withdraw their forces from #Yemen and leave it for good.
@m_audin @NegarMortazavi @NickKristof pathetic. 	the world acknowledged #Saudi’s efforts to help #Yemen + #SaudiArabia has donated money &amp; aids more than any country or organization.
@codepink @LockheedMartin no one is happy with wars, even those companies that build weapons, so stop focusing on #Saudi-led coalition and see what Iranian regime is doing in #Yemen.
@AJEnglish if #Qatar stopped its funding for terrorist groups such Houthis militants, I guess the civil war would be ended long time ago.
@AJEnglish the same war that #Qatar supports Houthis against the legitimate government of #Yemen. 	history will write that #Qatar was a negative party in this civil conflict.
@QatarAtUN @UNICEF @UN how hypocrites Qataris are!!	#Qatar secretly supported Houthis militants who brought crisis to #Yemen, and now you try to show yourselves as the good people!!
@Independent if the international community doesn’t act immediately against this brutal regime, I’m afraid to see a dark future for Middle East.
@Independent we believe that #Iran is the main source of terrorism and destruction in the Middle East. Iranian regime seeks to obtain nuclear weapons to spread chaos in the whole world and starts an infinite war.

@crimesofbrits stop manipulating people who reads your tweets, you’re acting unprofessional!!	we all know the truth of #Yemen’s civil war, don’t try to cover what Houthis did to Yemenis and make them as heroes.
@globeandmail @globepolitics coming days will show us if #Canada is going to respect others and apologize for its interfering, or it’ll act tough and refuse to admit its mistake.
@jmdominato_bird @CBCNews Saudi women asked for their right to drive and the government answered their request by allowing them to drive their cars. 	who told you that Saudis can’t express their rights?
@Davistroyw2017 @CBCNews #Canada crossed the line when it interfered in #Saudi’s internal affairs and asked to release some traitors, this’s not acceptable at all.
@CBCNews #Canada made a mistake and refused to admit it, it’s willing to harm its relationship with #SaudiArabia where citizens in both countries are the victims.
@m_audin @NegarMortazavi @NickKristof are you going to copy-paste this tweet and publish it everywhere??
@NegarMortazavi @NickKristof untrue!!	it’s correct that Iranian regime is the enemy of all good countries in the world, but that doesn’t mean to starving innocents people, terrorists’ media spread this fake news to make whoever fighting them withdraw their forces from #Yemen

@NRC_Egeland Yemeni families have suffered a lot from Houthis’s violence and attacks, and Iranian regime has supported the militants since day one and has no desire to stop their agendas.
@theIRC @DMiliband @PBS Yemen is being suffering from Houthis’s aggression since the civil war started. #UN was silent on their violence toward poor Yemenis &amp; #SaudiArabia that tries to help Yemeni legitimate government.
@RepBarbaraLee which means that you want Iranian regime extends its influence in #Yemen, which will in terrorists’ interests!!	think of world’s safety before you judge @POTUS administration.
@UN_Spokesperson @antonioguterres @HadiPresident we all seek to end the conflict in #Yemen, but Iran-backed Houthis don’t wanna see that happens. they ignored all attempts to settle the situation.
@KenRoth all replies under this tweet are the same exactly 🤭	I guess Houthis aren’t that smart to hide their plan after all.
@Fardoos___s @KenRoth are you guys are copying the same tweet 😂😂	get something cleaver next time you idiot doll.

@MohammedAli1908 @Ssshhhaaaaaaaaa @PressTV @khamenei_ir as I said, why’re talking here about our future, #Iran poses a great danger to the world’s safety and security. we cannot allow the regime to obtain nukes or any means of violence.
@KenRoth your agendas are obvious, you want the whole world go against #SaudiArabia which serve your interests, but it’s clear that you failed as always.
@KenRoth this deal proves that #Germany trusts #SaudiArabia and its use of weapons. 	I’m sure 100% that Germany government assured that its weapons aren’t using against civilians as media claims everyday.
@MohammedAli1908 @Ssshhhaaaaaaaaa @PressTV @khamenei_ir we’re in 2018, we’re talking about the danger of Iranian regime.

@PressTV @JZarif you mean the lesson of 9/11 when your country bombed the WTC by plane?	I guess the US administration know that it cannot trust your regime.
@PressTV are you guys jealous of others shaking @POTUS’s hand? is that because your dictator leader couldn’t do the same at #UNGA ??
@Ssshhhaaaaaaaaa @PressTV @khamenei_ir #Iran will use its nuclear weapons to terrorize the world and destroy everything.
@PressTV @khamenei_ir isn’t there anyone educate him about double standards as his?	it’s funny that he tries to show others as the oppressors while he classified as the worse.

@Faye0100 @pamaddo1 @AhmadAlgohbary FYI, Houthis are using Yemenis as human shields to protect theirselves from targeting. 	accidents &amp; mistakes happened but we need to eliminate the ones who threaten our safety before we lose more lives.
@Faye0100 @pamaddo1 @AhmadAlgohbary stopping terrorists and protecting the region also. 	the regime of #Iran has no desire to end the civil war in #Yemen, because of the war end then the regime will lose its influence in #Yemen.

@JZarif you need to learn how to keep your promises before lecturing others. 	#Iran couldn’t commit to its obligations because its goal is to bring the region into chaos, it doesn’t care about its people’s future or safety.
@JZarif your regime has threatened countries, blown up embassies, and killed diplomats. 	Iranian regime’s actions cannot be described or imagined.
@JZarif the only country in the world that seeks to destabilize the whole world is your regime. 	don’t even try to look like as a victim here.
@JZarif are you serious? don’t you see that your regime has lost its credibility with others?? you promised to stop your regime’s aggressive policies and nuclear programs, but yours kept running its facilities secretly.
@JZarif your regime isolated itself by supporting terrorists and funding them. 	by doing that, you prevent Iranians to live their lives freely because your policies are not acceptable to others.

@SecPompeo totally true, #Iran never acted as a good neighbor to others, it tried to interfere in others’ internal affairs and started conflicts by proxies.
@pamaddo1 @AhmadAlgohbary it bombs terrorists’ weapons bases that used to attack civilians in #Yemen. 	this’s the only way to protect the country till Yemeni legitimate government get control of its territories.
Houthis have destroyed Yemeni health and water facilities which lead the #Yemen to face starvation. https://t.co/6iu4dCS011
@AhmadAlgohbary your only sources are the Houthis’ ones, we cannot believe your claims or depend on them.
@astroehlein at least @POTUS has courage to praise his truly allies, unlike others. 	but did he praise #Qatar? no	do you know why? because it supports terrorists.
@astroehlein #SaudiArabia is being attacked everyday by Houthis who used Iran-made missiles, and no one has condemned that or talked about it!!!

@HighMission2 @haaretzcom #Qatar does nothing, it cheers for Houthis and watch them killing innocents Yemenis.
@haaretzcom #Qatar can ask its favorite friends in #Iran to stop interfering in #Yemen’s affairs and cut all way to support Houthis, in this way Yemen’s civil war will end.

@HassanRouhani as @nikkihaley said: “look at the mirror and you’ll see the mastermind behind the attack”.

@WSJ United Stated is condemning the attack on true Iranians, and Iranian regime is behind it but @khamenei_ir is trying to blame US administration to get his nuclear deal back to the table.

@Gardezi05 @khamenei_ir you’re cheerleader for the regime. 	how much did @HassanRouhani give you to say such thing!!
@Shahram4F @khamenei_ir the whole regime is about terrorists, from @khamenei_ir and @HassanRouhani to the #IRGC , none will believe that #Iran is being attacked by terrorists because they are its soldiers.
@Sadarudin @khamenei_ir they’ll do it again when he orders for it, because they were his soldiers in the first place.

@khamenei_ir don’t even play this game and blame others for your regime’s actions. United States &amp; other countries are caring about Iranian people more than you. 	Iranians want to change your regime that control their lives and freedom.
@khamenei_ir reports made by your assassins in #IRGC ??	Iranians want to live peacefully, and your regime is using them to achieve your goals.
@khamenei_ir do you hate humanity that much?? 	they’re innocents people who want to live peacefully with their loved ones. 	stop killing innocents.

@RandPaul BTW, saving #Yemen from Iranian regime &amp; Houthis doesn’t need VOTING!!! 	it’s a humanitarian case and we should all act immediately as #Saudi-led coalition did.
@RepRoKhanna do you know mr. senator that Houthis are the one who started the whole situation when they tried to occupy the country?!! they started to famine Yemenis and used them as human shields to protect themselves from targeting.
@PressTV those poor babies are suffering from famine because of Houthis’s aggression in #Yemen
@AJEnglish what about your workers who dies every day because of your preparation to host #WC2020
@SamCarp48 @PressTV says who? 	cut your crap off, Iranian regime tries to destabilize the whole world and claiming that they’ve nothing to do with it.
@PressTV your regime must stop interfering in others’ affairs immediately!! people have the right to live in peace, and you guys are ending that peace by your interfering.
@KishEMunthali @PressTV if Houthis stop their violence and retreat, #Yemen will be safe and secure again.
@PressTV shame on Houthis, they destroy everything even the food and other supplies. 	no idea how Yemenis will suffer this crisis while Iranian regime take side with Houthis.
@alanbender1965 @RTUKnews @GhanemAlmasarir I feel pity for you guys, seriously 💔	does #Saudi Crown Prince freak you this much!!
@RTUKnews @GhanemAlmasarir you’re coward, that’s why you make fun of others because you don’t have the courage to face them with facts.
@Sallmahmed4 @RepRoKhanna @teddy_cat1 and Houthis can’t do anything without Iranian regime’s help. 	at least #SaudiArabia is seeking to help Yemenis, unlike your regime who targets them.
@codepink @RepRoKhanna is that your way to make people read your fake reports? kissing his a** 💔	anyway, your agendas won’t work whatsoever.
@RepRoKhanna shame on you!!	United States never turned its back on people who needed help!!	Iranian regime is destroying #Yemen &amp; killing its people just to have control of the country.
@RepRoKhanna you’re using your position to mislead Americans and protect real killers of Yemenis.	you should tell them the truth about Iranian regime’s involvement.
@RepRoKhanna you can stop the war, call for stopping Iranian regime’s aggressive policies in Middle East, in that way Yemenis will finally live peaceful.
@codepink those poor innocents people were targeted by #Iran-made missiles that launched by Houthis, stop manipulating facts and covering the real killers.
@codepink explain to me how #SaudiArabia used U.S. weapons to repress internal dissent? did it kill them? did it air strike their houses? did it bomb their cars? nothing happened so stop claiming fake things.
@2HLfTjxek4cMNCi @teddy_cat1 @RandPaul wrong, Iranian regime &amp; Houthis won’t leave #Yemen alone so easily!! they’ll fight again and again as long they have power and money to fund their terrorist operations.
@2HLfTjxek4cMNCi @RandPaul @teddy_cat1 there’s a difference between involving directly in a war &amp; supporting civilians in their civil war. 	don’t jump into your selfish conclusion.
@RandPaul to stop it, then what??? waiting to witness the fall of #Yemen? to give Yemenis our back and stop helping them!!! 	is that your principal as a senator!!
@ChrisMurphyCT you should NOT depend on media’s reports, every channel or newspaper try to force its thoughts on readers, don’t be so silly.
@ChrisMurphyCT @CNN staff were given this information by an unknown group, which may be related to Houthis militants, so it’s normal to claim such a fake thing.

@Hengamehhh @SecPompeo @JohnKerry #Iran executes anyone for no reason.
@SecPompeo Iranian regime won’t stop or change its policies as long as @khamenei_ir is ruling the country.
@SecPompeo @JohnKerry the deal is bad for humanity, good for Iranian regime, we don’t wanna be part of a deal that cheers to terrorism.
@IRANisays @Martinio71 @SecPompeo let’s go back in time, Iranian regime was the main source of jihadists, it hosted &amp; trained them in order to launch terrorist attacks.
@IRANisays @Martinio71 @SecPompeo those sanctions caused by Iranian regime that supports terrorists and funds it.
@SecPompeo any country signs a deal with Iranian regime will be considered as a supporter of terrorism!!! no one should engage with terrorists at all.
@PressTV @realDonaldTrump of course he’ll support #SaudiArabia to stop Iranian regime’s aggressive policies in Middle East.

@SecPompeo @khamenei_ir Iranian regime doesn’t represent Islam at all, its #IRGC just like #ISIS and #Qaeda but it works under the government.
@AustinKonrad1 @TulsiPress are you defending the Syrian regime that used chemical weapons against its own people?
@AhmadAlgohbary @SecPompeo don’t whine here also, be a man and don’t be afraid to tell the world about Houthis’ aggression toward Yemenis.
@sarahleah1 @SecPompeo talk for yourself and don’t talk in behalf of people.
@SecPompeo I believe in the US current administration to bring peace back to Middle East and stop Iranian regime’s brutal policies in region.
@TulsiPress they’re not protecting any jihadist forces, in fact they’re acting alone to support Syrians.
@spp123steve12 @FeelTheBern01 @SenSanders and blaming the wrong people as usual.
@SenSanders all US officials admitted the #Saudi’s efforts in #Yemen, so why among all people you came out and called for stop supporting them to save poor Yemen!!!
@SenSanders @POTUS was once criticizing #SaudiArabia, but when he became in office recognized its efforts to secure the region, you don’t know everything happens inside closed rooms so don’t blame the wrong side.
@ChrisMurphyCT it’s shame to see you playing the senator role and use your position to go all against US’s &amp; Middle East’s interests. 	you need to re-think your decision that protected Houthis from taking responsibilities of their war crimes.
@ChrisMurphyCT if the port is controlled by Houthis, then we won’t save #Yemen whatever we do. 	because Houthis will control all shipments and food &amp; medical supplies.
@ChrisMurphyCT and this disaster happened because of Iranian regime’s support for Houthis to overtake #Yemen. 	they caused thousands of deaths and made the worse crisis of all time. 	they need to be stopped by international community immediately.
@ChrisMurphyCT let’s make it clear for audiences, Houthis destroyed medical centers and water facilities just to get their conditions accepted but they failed.
@ChrisMurphyCT wait a second!! are you that jealous because @POTUS chose #SaudiArabia as his first foreign trip? because he supports his ally in Middle East and almost starts a conflict with Iranian regime that you maybe one of its supporters?!!
@ChrisMurphyCT accident happens, and you can’t do anything if your enemy is too cowardly to fight.
@ChrisMurphyCT wrong, you’re misleading whoever reads your tweets!!!! #SaudiArabia never targeted civilians on purpose, Houthis were using them as human shields.
@ChrisMurphyCT so you admit that coalition is helping Yemeni government against Houthis!! 	when someone tries to take over your territory, you’ll do whatever it takes to protect it.
@ChrisMurphyCT neither US nor #SaudiArabia did target civilians in #Yemen, they’re only air striking Houthis militants. 	I’ve never seen you condemning Houthis, not even once.
@CarolineLucas you’re repeating the same lies every time you tweet about #Yemen even though US &amp; UK officials denied any reports of such claims.
@drumkev @FionaOnasanyaMP @SachiKnight @EmilyThornberry yeah they know what they’re doing in #Yemen, they’re protecting the country and helping its people to survive and live.
@FionaOnasanyaMP @EmilyThornberry you’re talking nonsense here, based on what you demand to remove the #Saudi government? who’re you to call for stop arms deals? believe me you better stop your claims asap.
@TagTeamYemen @UNHumanRights @BaFana3 @WFP you said it, by Houthis, by terrorists, by invaders!!	most incidents were planned by them in order to make the situation more difficult to save.
@UNHumanRights @WFP United States &amp; coalition are doing their best to save and secure as many people as they can from Houthis’s aggression. 	we need to unite in order to rebuild #Yemen like it was before and better.
@codepink @LockheedMartin because they know very well that their bombs aren’t used to target innocents people, and US defense minister has supported this fact days ago.
@RainMirron @Mochi_Sandvich @AbdulElSayed they’ve trained before in #Iran and evidence proves that. 	my point is, we cannot allow Iranian regime to do such thing again, we had enough of losses.
@KJackottawa @SenSchumer @girlsreallyrule #SaudiArabia has nothing to do with that attack!! the country by itself denied the tragic incident and condemned the terrorists. 	ask @khamenei_ir about the mastermind of that operation.
@Mochi_Sandvich @AbdulElSayed I admit 15 out of 19 were from Saudi Arabia, but they were in #Iran to train and get whatever they need to do the operation.
@SenSchumer still the threat is on, as long as Iranian regime is in power and threatening others by funding &amp; providing weapons to militants, we can’t live in peace.
@AbdulElSayed they’re brave people who died by a terrorist attack launched by Iranian regime.
@SecPompeo by murderous jihadists who trained and hosted by Iranian regime, we all hope the current administration put an end of the Iranian regime forever.

@MichelleGhsoub lies, no one will be afraid of their government if they didn’t do anything wrong, so stop manipulating people by your words.
@Sukdurrani @khamenei_ir let’s start with Iranian regime that classified itself as “Islamic country”, the regime must stop its aggressive policies and violence against innocents people in Middle East, no one wants to see more conflicts or wars.
@ImdadhusainN @khamenei_ir you’re copying a tweet!! don’t you have your own words or thoughts?
@khamenei_ir it’s better to deal with your country’s internal affairs and try to solve issues that Iranians are complaining about. 	Iranians have the right to live peacefully and in dignity.
@khamenei_ir so stop targeting innocents people in #Yemen and destroying the country. 	your regime are not welcome there, so get out of it immediately.
@khamenei_ir don’t even try to involve #Russia in Middle East’s issues. Russia has its own problems and we know it’s a good ally of your regime.
@khamenei_ir it’s about time for you to face consequences for your regime’s actions and violence against Yemenis.
@khamenei_ir #SaudiArabia and its partners will save #Yemen and won’t allow your regime to put its dirty hands on it. 	your regime has brought chaos to #Yemen and we had enough.
@washingtonpost it’s so obvious now that Iraqis are upset about Iranian regime’s presence in their territories, the regime is not there to help, but to overtake the country.
@PressTV #IranDeal was the reason why we see disasters and destructions all over the region.
@khamenei_ir you’re upset about US sanctions on your regime, but so happy because you’re using Twitter and Iranians don’t!!
@khamenei_ir in the end #Russia, #Turkey, and US will restore their relationships and start working together again, then your regime will suffer more sanctions from all sides.
@khamenei_ir @RT_Erdogan you care about Palestinians??? what a joke. 	your regime is the main reason why Palestinians are suffering until this day.

@AFP anyone tries to destabilize the Saudi society with zero intention to make life better will face trial.
@ADIsaddlers @KenRoth if #Spain canceled the deal, there’re others willing to make deals with #saudiarabia.
@KenRoth it canceled the deal because it didn’t want coalition to target terrorists (the Houthis) anymore.
“amid fears that the weapons could be used against Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen”. 	this explains everything, #Spain is protecting terrorists!!! https://t.co/2FVeiIEh9i
@joelbourne1 @GarethPorter @JustinTrudeau mistakes happen but what’s important is to keep protecting our brothers in #Yemen and #Syria.
@hannah_allawi @GarethPorter @VioletVampire2 not all, only #Iran and whosever support the regime like Houthis and #Hezbollah.
@GarethPorter it’s been done by accident, and coalition admitted that. but you can’t compare that to many attacks targeted innocents people by Houthis.
@LotteLeicht1 they’re two different things, don’t mix everything up to use it for your agendas. 		#SaudiArabia is protecting its security from inside and outside, and Canada must stop interfering in others’ internal affairs.
@AJENews this’s your goal from day one, it doesn’t matter who attacked the bus, you’ll keep demanding stop arms deals whatsoever.
@JZarif #Iranian regime is an active actor in Middle East, in negative way. 	your country is the biggest sponsor of terrorism and number one supporter. 	you’ve no right to talk about others while you kill innocents and torture others.

@Desert_Vox @PressTV in region my friend.
@Desert_Vox @PressTV and who gave Persians the right to represent #Islam? don’t forget that most Muslims are Arabs, and the gulf are surrounded by Arab countries, which means it’s the Arabian Gulf.

@readyrock2 @CNN the real threat in Middle East is the Iranian regime, you can’t withdraw all your forces and give the regime a chance to extend its influence in region.
@CNN and all participants are taking the safety of civilians in their consideration, so stop your fake news and don’t misleading your audience.
@CNN #Saudi-led coalition is dealing with all operations professionally with coordination with US &amp; UK, all operations are being watched by all coalition’s participants.
@Reuters I advise you if you wanna have an exclusive news, try not to publish a fake one.
@EverettColdwell UN started to lose its credibility and people’s trust after its latest fake reports it published. 	UN must stand up for its principles and stop covering up Iranian regime’s actions.
@DOSTOYEV1 @PressTV so funny but don’t throw jokes again 🤭 your regime has suppressed all peaceful rallies that called for change foreign policies and develop the economy
@PressTV look who’s talking here about executions 😂 didn’t Iranian regime execute dozens of innocents people in #Iran and #Yemen!!!
@PressTV for what? he had nothing to do with economic collapse after #IRGC got all money to fund their terrorist operations in region.
@ZaidZamanHamid it’s so obvious that you cannot face the real killers, and instead you attack dead people.
@ZaidZamanHamid Iranian regime has been killing innocents people in #Syria, #Iraq, #Yemen, #Afghanistan, #Pakistan, and other countries, and here you are attacking him after he died.
@ICRC what’s the common element among those 3 countries?????? 	the Iranian regime of course, every time the regime interfere in any country, it collapsed and destroyed.

@FoxNews that’s our goal, just remember how much Gulf countries have suffered from Iranian regime and its aggressive policies.
@AJENews #Iran is the last country that has the right to complain about wars.
@AJENews at least US didn’t launch attacks on #Iran as the regime do toward #SaudiArabia and other regional countries.
@Aremu1986 @Ahmadinejad1956 yes you can say the Iranian regime, don’t be afraid 😄 the regime seeks to control #Yemen to make it their new base and launch its operations so easily.
@Ahmadinejad1956 you’ve no right to talk about tragedies in region while you were a president of the regime that destroyed people’s dreams of live in peace.
@Ahmadinejad1956 look who’s talking about establishing peace and prevent wars 😂 did you forget the terrorist operations you launched when you were in power?? forgot 9/11?
@Ahmadinejad1956 you did nothing for your people when you were in power, in fact you destroyed their lives and dreams of having a bright future.
@SarbazSart @Ahmadinejad1956 he was the main reason for economic collapse because when he was in office he used the Iranian economy to invest in terrorism.
@Ahmadinejad1956 and the clearest example is the Iranian regime who controls Iranians who seek to live in peace. 	Iranians are the victims of your presidency, you used all money to fund terrorism while you should spent it to develop the economy.
@SenatorDurbin to release them all with no condition!! who’re you to ask a government to do such thing? maybe you didn’t learn from #Canada’s mistake.
@AJEnglish your HRW has lost its credibility, just like you.	you both spread &amp; publish fake reports that misleading people who trusted you for years.
@aarondmiller2 #UN is being paid by some countries that are trying to blame #SaudiArabia for chaos in Middle East.

@davidcsurin @Reuters by supporting the biggest sponsor of terrorism.
@Kathryn69457678 @Reuters maybe some European countries are trying to buy its security by giving the regime what it needs.
@Kathryn69457678 @Marcdelmas3 @Reuters it’s up to you but when it comes to security we all care about our safety and future, as long as the Iranian regime has money to fund its terrorist operations, we won’t live in peace.
@Reuters totally unacceptable act from #EU, European nations should help protecting the world and make sure our people live in peace, and giving 20 millions aids to Iranian regime doesn’t achieve our goals.
@PressTV hope soon Iranians live freely without the regime’s control.
@britton_durham @RT_com which wrong message exactly you mean?	US is trying to cut funding terrorism to one purpose: TO SAVE THE WORLD.
@sirasaf @RT_com those 20 millions can fund 2 or 3 terrorist attacks on United States or another country, innocents will die because of that aid.
@RT_com then what’ll happen? Iranian regime will use that money to fund its terrorism operations that risk the whole world.
@PressTV #EU doesn’t care about world’s safety, just like the Iranian regime. 	supporting terrorism isn’t acceptable and the international community must act ASAP.

@AhmadAlgohbary so you start using displaced people as victims to blame coalition!!!! shame on you. 	you should stop your Houthis friends from playing dirty and leave innocents people out of the war.
@kalofye @RoKhanna @Mpeacemaker killing innocents people is inhuman and Houthis must stop using Yemenis as human shields.
@RoKhanna and based on what you determined they’ve been killed by American weapons? why you didn’t say maybe they’re killed by Iranian weapons?
@PandActivist @RoKhanna and not forgiving those who’re in power and helped the Iranian regime to have more power to destabilize Middle East
@RoKhanna how disgusting you are!!	so you blame #SaudiArabia for the war and ignore the fact that Iranian regime &amp; Houthis are the ones who started the war in #Yemen
@i24NEWS_EN @ambmcg @MichelleMakori the #Saudi minister meant to say that the brutal #Israel didn’t prevent Muslims from performing #Hajj this year, unlike #Qatar
@PressTV #SaudiArabia is doing its best to serve all Muslims who came to perform their rituals. 	its efforts are appreciated by all nations except Iranian regime who’s trying to control all muslim nations.
@ArnMenconi @AhmadAlgohbary @RepRoKhanna you’ll blame US &amp; #SaudiArabia for what’s happening in #Yemen and don’t say a word to Iranian regime and Houthis who’ve been killing &amp; torturing Yemenis.
@AhmadAlgohbary are you trying to fool us? we know who’s killing innocents people in #Yemen, your Houthis friends and their ally (the Iranian regime).
@AhmadAlgohbary which means the coalition has a full support from United States, the support that seeks to protect Yemenis and the regional countries from the danger of Iranian regime and Houthis.
@humdard73 what’s your source? because what you have said isn’t true at all!!!! it’s a shame to lying to people who believe you.

@andr5452 @rmmtenterprises @TorontoStar okey then why didn’t #Canada talk about human rights in #Iran?
@Musasalifu007 @AJEnglish it’s totally wrong and fake news. 	since when #SaudiArabia started to ban Muslims to come to #Makkah and perform one of the 5 religious rituals!!!!
@Ilyas5138 @AJEnglish seriously? you believed that lie?	#SaudiArabia didn’t ban Iranians from #hajj, so you think it’d do that to poor Qataris???
@AJEnglish liars. 	#SaudiArabia has opened all ways for Qataris to perform #Hajj this year, and it created 2 sites for them to complete their applications, BUT Qatari regime has blocked the sites and prevent its people to go to #Makkah
@rmmtenterprises @TorontoStar crown prince needs not to do that to tell anyone how strong and effective he is. but #Canada violated international norms and interfered in its internal affairs and that was unacceptable at all.
@TorontoStar your attempts to make #SaudiArabia looks like it is a dangerous place is unacceptable, you’re not attacking #SaudiArabia only, but all Muslims countries also.
@TorontoStar all Muslims appreciate what #SaudiArabia is doing for them to make #hajj much easier, its efforts are indescribable and great. 	no country can host 1.7 millions of visitors in one place and mange that so professional.
@karl_haynes @codepink FYI, Houthis are using Yemenis as human shields, to protect their asses. 	this’s inhuman and unethical.
@codepink it even hosted Yemenis children and provided all they need to start their lives again after what they saw in #Yemen
@codepink #SaudiArabia has been helping children in #Yemen since the civil war started, it gave them health care and built schools for them.
@codepink isn’t there any chance that Houthis launched the attack and manipulated the crime scene to make coalition looks like it’s their doing?
@codepink @SenBobCorker @RepEliotEngel @RepEdRoyce I agree that #Yemen can’t wait for too long but as long as Iranian regime &amp; Houthis have their presence in #Yemen, there’ll be no peace.
@RepRoKhanna you can end the civil war in #Yemen by stopping Iranian regime’s support for militants there.
@paray1 @PressTV your defense minister is manipulating you guys 🤭 there’s no new fighter jet with great capabilities made in #Iran
@PressTV is it real jet or just a big toy to show off as always!?
@ChrisMurphyCT I wanna see what’ll you do about that?	will you condemn and call for stopping the regime, or you’ll keep silent?
@ChrisMurphyCT you keep talking about that a lot recently but no mention about #Iran’s present &amp; influence in #Yemen. 	Iranian regime is destroying the country and killing its people by providing weapons to Houthis.
@ChrisMurphyCT all operations are within the international laws, and US administration aware of that. 	US support is necessary to protect Yemenis there from Houthis’ violence.
@ChrisMurphyCT the problem isn’t with the bombs, it’s about Houthis use of civilians as human shields, this’s unacceptable and inhuman, US administration have to do more to stop terrorists in #Yemen
@ChrisMurphyCT but investigation is not done yet, why did you conclude it’s launched by #Saudi-led coalition? did someone asked you to say that?
@KoenSwinkels @RoKhanna @ChaseMadar you maybe right, sites controlled by Houthis have many people and we don’t know if they’re all okay or not.
@CherylC43735341 @RoKhanna it’s not about money or oil as you said, it’s about securing the world from militants in Middle East, those terrorists if they did take over #Yemen, then one day you’ll see them in your neighborhood as #ISIS
@RoKhanna for your information and you already know that, Houthis &amp; Iranian regime are the ones responsible for tragedies are happening in #Yemen, you should condemn them for their actions not to protect their asses.
@RoKhanna and you immediately jumped into blaming #SaudiArabia, the one that provided aids to Yemenis, and let Houthis walked away without condemnation!!!!!!		shame on you.
@tparsi there’s no country on the planet that can pay 4 billions immediately, and #SaudiArabia won’t do that as long the brutal regime still in power in #Syria.
@AhmadAlgohbary you don’t have the right to talk while supporting terrorists!!	you don’t have the right to speak on behalf of Yemenis while you praise your Houthis friends!!	you don’t have the right blame the ones who help #Yemen while you attack them!!
@carlbildt each and every country should respect the other, and that includes stopping interfering in others’ affairs, and arresting of innocents without trials.
@AhmadAlgohbary peace will come when Houthis and Iranian regime stop killing innocents in #Yemen
@GaryOrrell @rulajebreal I agree, Houthis don’t care a bit about Yemenis who have nothing to do with that conflict. 	international community must act quickly and stop those militants before it’s too late.
@rulajebreal did US administration say that? US’s defense? any official? No?	don’t depend on unsure reports that aim to distract people from discovering the truth.
@PressTV you such big liars, Yemenis know who’s destroying their country, it’s the regime of #Iran.
@PressTV meant to harass Iranian regime, not poor Iranians. 	Iranians have the right to live their lives with dignity and respect, the regime should provide everything they need.
@PressTV they’re being trapped by Houthis, not Saudis!	when will you guys start telling truth to the people?

@SenWarren let me ask you: how many Yemenis have been killed by Houthis and #Iran within these three years? hundreds of thousands of innocents people and US &amp; coalition are trying to stop those brutal militants.
@afcoory @CristianeNogara @Sophiemcneill @hrw #Iran is funding terrorists in #Yemen
@Sophiemcneill and Houthis still use children as their shields 💔 it’s a shame to set and watch those radical Houthis kill innocents people with no mercy.
@ElectroWave @RT_com #Iraq, #Afghanistan, #Syria, #Yemen and Lebanon had suffered from Iranian regime which tries to wider its radical influence in region. 	#Iran is more dangerous than US or Russia
@VanTomas2 @PressTV it was planned by #Iran in the first place, launched and filmed by Houthis, end of story.
@PressTV I’m wondering how did they film it 🤔
I don’t know from where #UN gets its reports about #Yemen, it’s so sad to see how misleading it becomes. https://t.co/oWovobfG0J
@Just_Parth @tedlieu @DoD_IG I guess everyone doesn’t include the poor Iranian people who lives under the regime.
@tedlieu @DoD_IG you just listen to Houthis’ media without checking its credibility, therefore you tweet and mislead your followers.
@tedlieu @DoD_IG all operations launched by coalition is totally legitimate and targeted Houthis’ figures, so stop whining and do your job for humanity and condemn Iranian regime for the destruction of #Yemen
@PressTV @hrw @UN @amnesty good job, you sacrifice innocents kids just to achieve your goals 💔
@PressTV @hrw @UN @amnesty the question is:	how did you film this video before it bombed? it’s clearly obvious the whole story was planned by Houthis.
@PressTV @jeremycorbyn this’s what you guys want because @jeremycorbyn is one of your fellows and totally supports your aggressive agendas.
@jricole yes, their voices were and will always be heard. 	#Saudi women do have their rights and are satisfied with everything the government has done for them.
@ElectroWave @RT_com respect it for what exactly? for its brutal policies in Middle East? for its support for terrorism? for its goals to launch nuclear war?
@RT_com this man cannot be trusted whatsoever, he’s radical thoughts that focus on killing anyone doesn’t obey his revolutionary  message.
@AhmadAlgohbary very good, you memorized everything #Iran taught you to say in front of the camera. 		I hope that #Yemen will be free of Houthis very soon.
@amazinggrac @CNN all of us are concerned about #Yemen, but there’ll be no end of civil war there as long as #Iran supports the militants.
@CNN so stop blaming the coalition and focus on Houthis actions against Yemenis.
@CNN to address what exactly! the incident is being under investigation right now and neither you or US administration knows what really happened back then.
@AJEnglish look who’s talking here!! the pro-terrorism channel that promotes violence and chaos in the region.
@AJENews attending the victims’ funeral &lt;&lt; this describes your situation in #Yemen @AJEnglish
@khamenei_ir your regime funds terrorism and you ask for respect!! are you insane?		stop destroying the planet &amp; killing people and then you’ll have the respect you want.
@khamenei_ir US respects whoever seeks to establish peace and love, not as #Iran or #Russia.
@khamenei_ir they’ve strategic and powerful relations in many fields and that includes humanitarian field, which your regime doesn’t acknowledge at all by providing weapons to terrorists in #Yemen to kill poor innocents children and women.
@reza_banihashem @khamenei_ir which missiles Houthis used to kill Yemenis? Iranian missiles of course.
@khamenei_ir it’s too sad to see the brutal dictator who killed Yemenis tweets about the the suffering they live everyday and blames others.
@khamenei_ir Yemenis wouldn’t suffer any of those tragedies if your regime didn’t interfere in their lives and tried to control them by force.
@saltaf01 @EverettColdwell @GhamadiAbdullah @cafreeland all I see is #Canada making deals with regime of #Iran. 	if it ever condemned , I wouldn’t be serious about it.
@khamenei_ir there’ll be a chance to reach a better deal with the current administration when your regime changes. 		this will make everyone happy.
@khamenei_ir your economy is being used to fund terrorism, there’s no way you can reach the level you mentioned while Iranians don’t get any benefit from their country’s economy.
@khamenei_ir negotiations are the safest way to calm down crazy terrorists, such as your regime!!	it’s not a business when US tries its best to save the world from destruction.
@khamenei_ir @HassanRouhani it’s so obvious that #Iran doesn’t want negotiations because its planning to develop nukes these days.
@khamenei_ir but your government’s president @HassanRouhani and his fellows hinted that there’ll be a war on United States and the rest of the world who’ll stand against #Iran
does he live in our planet or what? 😁	Yemenis are being targeted &amp; bombed by Iranian missiles, Iranian weapons. 	facts don’t lie 😌 https://t.co/cH5AROO1AR
@EverettColdwell @GhamadiAbdullah @saltaf01 so please stop whining about your government’s failure and try to call your FM @cafreeland to correct her mistake and stop interfering in others’ affairs if she doesn’t want to condemn #Iran.
@EverettColdwell @GhamadiAbdullah @saltaf01 #Canada shouldn’t make deals with terrorists, and I mean the Iranian regime!!	becoming a friend of #Iran doesn’t allow you to call for human rights while the regime is killing innocents in #Yemen and #Syria.
@AJENews #Qatar stole its people’s rights to perform #Hajj, the regime forced the people to keep their money home in order to avoid economic crisis because it insist to fund terrorists.
@AJENews let’s compare it with poor Qataris who’re prevented to travel to #Makkah for #Hajj, at least #Saudi students are okey with the decision, but Qataris are complaining about their regime’s selfish decision.
@mattyglesias wrong!	according to coalition, it’s been informed of every operations the coalition launched, with full details because the US is a valuable &amp; friendly ally of #SaudiArabia &amp; #UAE
@EmmaMAshford but who said that US is unaware of every operation of #Saudi-led coalition? it’s aware very well and supporting all operations that aim to counter terrorism in #Yemen
@cnni he’s totally right, #UK shouldn’t help the regime of #Iran whatsoever, that’s why it should take the advice and stand up for what’s best for the world’s future.
@Raindropsbc @CNN to side with terrorists? hmm I’m wondering what’ll happen!! ooh it means any country allies with #Iran will consider as funder of terrorism.
@CNN there’s no point to side with #Iran or make deals with the regime, so it’s better for #UK to be on the same page with @POTUS against Iranian regime.
@FakeAjebutter @AJENews #Yemen is one of the gulf countries and the weakest one, that’s why Iranian regime funded Houthis to drag it into chaos in order to impose its influence all over the region.

@KenRoth so stop manipulating your followers by lies that serve your unknown agendas.
@KenRoth 3) women in #SaudiArabia have their full rights in doing whatever they want as long they respect the laws and their parents. 	4) in #Yemen, we all know what’s going on and you specifically know that Houthis &amp; Iranians are targeting innocents people there.
@KenRoth okey mr. Roth let me enlighten you a little bit. 	1) executions are for terrorists and whoever kill a human being.	2) there’s no dissent in #SaudiArabia, they’re traitors who stab their country from the back.
@ToobaTariq1 @WFP who’d believe this one? Iranian regime has blown up embassies around the world and killed diplomats.
@tommyhashbrown @USAmbUK our differences in thoughts is normal because each one of us see it from a specific view, but trust me the deal was a bad one because the regime used it to fund terrorism.
@60slib1 @USAmbUK there’s no regime in #UnitedStates, of course I mean the Iranian regime.
@Dipmishrad @WFP @UN Houthis started the war when they tried to over take the country years ago, we need to stop them to end the civil war.
@ToobaTariq1 @WFP the US caused all the mess? what about #Iran!! don’t tell me it is innocent and US tries to throw the blame on it.
@WFP poor kids, they witnessed the civil war in their childhood and learnt how to survive the bombing. 	international community should save them by helping #Saudi-led coalition there.
@WFP Yemenis are brave because they stood up for their principles and faced Houthis militants who’re trying to bring disaster into the country.
@tommyhashbrown @USAmbUK it was a failure deal that allowed Iranian regime to keep its violence policies that caused a lot of deaths and destructions.
@USAmbUK I don’t think there’ll be any agreement with #Iran as long as the regime is in power and use any means to revive terrorism again.

@astroehlein Houthis used those children as human shields to cover themselves, they’re recruiting children and women to do their dirty works. 	international community must save those lives from Houthis’ aggression.
@astroehlein are you trying to be funny! nice try. 	#SaudiArabia didn’t cut all ties with #Canada because it values its relationship with it, it made the door open to resolve the situation later.
@astroehlein rights defenders you mentioned are people who betrayed the country and tried to harm the society.
@astroehlein #SaudiArabia cares about its citizens’ human rights more than anyone, but it won’t allow ANYBODY to interfere in its internal affairs and especially the security one.
@codepink #Canada made a mistake and didn’t have the courage to apologize, that’s why it made the whole situation relevant to human rights and forgot it also has issues in human rights.
@asadabukhalil you guys are the ones who brought destruction in the world by your hypothetical situations and speeches.
@DemolitionBlond @guardian who told you that account was representing #SaudiArabia??? only #Saudi officials make statements by officials means.
@margheritamvs it can give a sincere apology and vow not to do it again.
@raznochinets @AMPicard1 @guardian 9/11 attack was planned by Iranian regime and there’s plenty of evidence, that’s why was #Iran considered as the biggest sponsor for terrorism.
@mgsylvestre @guardian whoever posted it has no desire to such thing, he wasn’t lucky of choosing the photo that’s all.
@guardian it was a mistake and #Saudi authorities acted quickly by deleting the infographic and apologizing.
@aarondmiller2 + US knows its interests more than you, its interest in Middle East is to cut all ways to fund terrorism and that includes #Qatar and #Yemen
@aarondmiller2 #SaudiArabia and United States are allies for decades, they’ve disagreements over many things but that doesn’t mean they can interfere in other’s internal affairs like #Canada did.
@mitchellreports @StateDept both of US and #Canada have issues with human rights in their countries, and #SaudiArabia didn’t mention that before and asked them to correct their internal situation because it’s their own business.
@RT_com did you see one #Saudi official threatened #Canada by launching an attack? of course not. 		as a professional news channel, you must check of how true the news is before publishing a report about it.
@DrZuhdiJasser you’re talking bullshit here!!	all world’s experts and analysts admitted how successful the reforms are.
@Alex_Panetta reforms meant to protect the #Saudi society from all dangers, and that includes foreign interfering in internal affairs.
@AliAlAhmed_en so what? what’s your point!
@LindseyGrahamSC that’s why we all should support @POTUS decisions that aim to stop the violence of Iranian regime.
@cafreeland ooh really? aren’t you going to apologize for your interfering?	you should respect other countries’ sovereignty and stop crossing the red lines.
@JAS_QATAR @Ola_Salem @Dr_Ulrichsen of course you didn’t, it’s your official source to fund terrorism.
@sunlorrie 2. You should hear official statements from #Saudi officials, not accounts you don’t know who’s running them.
@sunlorrie you’ve to know 2 things:	1. #SaudiArabia doesn’t agree with that infographic, therefore it asked the owner to delete it and brought to investigate.
@JAS_QATAR @Ola_Salem @Dr_Ulrichsen at least they apologized for it and started investigation, unlike your country which denied everything while the world see the opposite.
@aarondmiller2 @Ola_Salem @Dr_Ulrichsen first, #SaudiArabia has nothing to do with 9/11, go and check. 	second, whoever running that account is not representing the #Saudi government. 	finally, #saudiarabia will never do such thing, never ever!!
@Ola_Salem @media_ksa I can bring to you plenty of verified accounts that threat Saudi Arabia everyday, does that mean they represent their governments? of course not.
@Ola_Salem that account made a mistake, and #saudiarabia had asked the account’s owner to shut it down, and started investigation. 		so don’t spread lies.
@realDonaldTrump we can’t let the regime do whatever it wants anymore, Iranians and the regional countries are suffering from that regime so tough sanctions are necessary.

@ChrisMurphyCT to do reforms, #SaudiArabia needs to secure its society from foreign organizations that aim to harm the country from inside. 	those who’re arrested are accused of contacting with outsiders.
@saisrini9 @PENamerican @hrw @Telegraph do you want other countries condemn US for its internal decisions?
@PENamerican @hrw @Telegraph they’re under investigation, they’ll be released if they’re innocents, otherwise you cannot stick your nose in #SaudiArabia’s internal affairs.
@SenatorMenendez @WhiteHouse be aware that #HRW did nothing to condemn Iranian regime’s brutal suppression against its people who’ve no access to internet.
@SenatorMenendez @WhiteHouse have you done anything to American women’ human rights in United States? or Iranian people’?
@shireen818 okey then your claim was based on some #FakeNews from @AJEnglish, your agendas are so clear so don’t bother yourself to confess people that Houthis are the good people.
@SenRubioPress as a senator, why you didn’t talk about Yemenis’ human rights that were stolen by #Iran and Houthis!!!!
@SenRubioPress there’re activists who call for better future for all citizens in a legal way, but others -the traitors- who got their orders from foreign organizations seek to destabilize the #Saudi society.
@hisham_melhem traitors who seek to destabilize the society will be jailed for their crimes until they return to their minds.
@hisham_melhem yeah keep defending your Iranians friends who brought disaster and chaos to #Yemen.

@AliAbunimah why’d #SaudiArabia invade #Qatar? 	I don’t know why media is trying to deepen the situation!!
@OTweet1Tweet @AJEnglish wow, I never thought Turkish troops are strong enough to stop three forces 😂 I mean, Kurds faced #turkey one on one and they succeeded.
@nairsudhir @AJEnglish and you believed the report? if #Tillerson lost his job because of that, he’ll say that loud and clear in an interview.
@AJEnglish what a bullshit, is #Qatar trying to show itself as a victim here? how pathetic.
@AnneBayefsky @arabnews Iranians are sick of their regime that control their lives. they only want the freedom of speech and living. they want to contact with the outside world but the regime’s made it more difficult.
@PoliticalShort it’s the reality, #Iran’s regime has surpassed its people and blocked social media apps and used its economy for terrorism.
@AhmadAlgohbary facts don’t lie. 	#Iran is behind all tragedies in #Yemen, you’re defending the regime because it helps your Houthis friends.
@ForeignAffairs the Iranian influences are behind the civil war in #Yemen, first we need to stop the regime of #Iran in order to end Yemen’s crisis.
@anaijaz @RT_com we are here talking about Iran’s threats, I guess it’s more important than corruption.

@IloveQatar1970 @ALThani_M @hassanalishaq73 @SeppBlatter corrupt people will get what they deserve at the end, and #Qatar doesn’t deserve to host the next #WC22 because it played dirty over there.

@BREAKING_PTV Houthi’s media will always be like this, to spread #FakeNews by using Iranian media and mix everything up.
@DRovera #UN nowadays is losing its credibility with everyone, it covers some of Houthis’ actions that risk yemenis’ lives.
@AhmadAlgohbary then Houthis used Yemenis’ needs to recruit children to do their dirty works, so it’s clear who’s killing children’s freedom.
@AhmadAlgohbary #SaudiArabia has given humanitarian aids and medical supplies to Yemenis after Houthis destroy their houses and hospitals. 	you need to see the true side of the situation before claiming fake things.
@BaFana3 @Reuters Iran’s and Houthis’ threats are real, if they get lucky to bomb one of those oil ships, we’ll face an environmental crisis + it’ll effect the oil international trade.
@KenRoth + Houthis are hiding in the most important sites, we need to get rid of them quickly in order to rebuild #Yemen soon.
@KenRoth in order to take Houthis out of #Hodeidah, some damage is must.
@MazMHussain #ArabNato is for MENA’s affaires, to combat any threats that’ll risk the regional countries like #Iran’s threats.
@ChiuljuPussala @astroehlein to protest? 	#UN should take measure steps against Iranian regime’s actions in #Yemen to prevent new crisis in future.
@hosseinsafari99 @astroehlein trust me, coalition is more cautious than Houthis it Iranian agents in this point.
@astroehlein #UN recently published reports that based on false information and never told from who it took that information, I cannot believe them anymore.
FYI, #SaudiArabia have an issue with the regime of #Iran, not with its people who’re suffering from the regime as well. https://t.co/66gKRQmc2i
@PressTV look who’s talking here 😂 do you really think your regime is strong enough that you are so sure?
@PressTVPrograms my question is: do Iranians have access to good education system and other tools to develop their knowledge while they’re being blocked to use social media apps and Internet??
@PressTV the regime doesn’t have the courage to engage with the great US administration at all.
@PressTV this meeting proves to you guys how much the relationship between the two countries are strong. 	#SaudiArabia will never turn its back on the #Palestinian case.
@Ema_x22 @PressTV yes, they thought they could do it in a blink of an eye and have control of the main source of humanitarian aids.
@PressTV who’d believe the fake reports from #UN nowadays?
@PressTV stop making me laugh 😅	there’s a difference between a missile hits its target, and a missile that hits the same ground its launch 😂
@haaretzcom #Jerusalem was and will be the capital of #Palestine, #Israel must stop its aggression toward Palestinians or otherwise it’ll have difficulties in its future business with Arabs.
@Joyce_Karam @TheNationalUAE plus, most smuggling weapons that Houthis have came from Oman’s borders, so if #Oman wants to play the moderator, it needs to stop supporting militants.
@Joyce_Karam @TheNationalUAE #Oman wants the US administration to lift the new sanctions on #Iran which consider as its closest ally.
@KenRoth #Iran has nothing to do there, its exist there will make the situation more difficult for Syrians to return.
@KenRoth and it’ll never be safe as long as #IRGC still there.
@KenRoth unless Houthis back off and leave the port. 	Yemenis are sick of Houthis’ existence in their territories that risk their lives.
@KenRoth @nikkihaley @hrw @amnesty at least she condemned the two organizations based on facts. they both publish fake reports just to cover their failure of doing their jobs.
@KenRoth @nikkihaley @hrw @amnesty regardless of what her reasons are, both #HRW and #Amnesty changed a lot in the past few years, they stopped condemning real dangerous actions made by Iranian and Assad regimes in region.

@MehrnewsCom and iranian isn’t? how hypocritical you are.
@rahuldewan @DanielWickham93 @JKhashoggi don’t involve #Islam in this. 	#ISIS did kill innocents by the name of Islam even though those innocents were Muslims.
@DanielWickham93 @JKhashoggi he’s hypocrite 😃 if he isn’t hiding something then why’d he leave the country? and how come he knew that he’ll be arrested?
@MarkAmesExiled it’s the Iranian strategy to famine Yemenis and blames US and coalition for that crisis.
@PressTV I guess they killed so many of your soldiers and prevent weapons smuggling.
@Desert_Vox @PressTV the good news you’ll see it when the regime of #Iran collapse.
@Trek_Elite @PressTV hello pro-regime doll, how many lives your regime has been taken because of its aggressive policies!!
@PressTV when will you guys leave the innocents out of the war and start to think by your minds?
@PressTV shame on you for involving Yemenis in Houthis’ attack!!!	the drone clearly made in #Iran, and the attack didn’t cause any harm to the airport.
so he means #Iran won’t stop supporting terrorists or destabilizing regional security. https://t.co/DruDsgwVbQ
@PressTV one question, do Iranians have enough food  while the regime using its economy to fund terrorism and militants in region?
@EtratAli1 @PressTV if you meant leaders who sacrifice their people for terrorism’s goals, then you’ve no idea what does the term of “leader” mean.
@waquar_haidry @PressTV the idiot so-called leader 🤭
@PressTV @POTUS may start the war, and #Iran’s regime will lose it for sure.
@froehlichhuahin @iucurrent @AJEnglish look who’s talking here 😂 	why do you defend the regime of #Iran? is it your country?
@Shaharyar__Alam @AJEnglish actually, it’s an aggressive war launched by Iranian regime and idiots Houthis on Yemeni government and its people.
@AJEnglish then they sell what they’ve stolen to fund their operations and give salaries to their brutal militants.
@AJEnglish I’ll tell you how:	Houthis attack medical shipment and steal it, and sometimes they just bomb it in order not to be used.
@kay41981 @PressTV then you should talk to Iranian regime and ask them.
@sagir42 @PressTV for what? for its efforts to secure Yemenis’ safety and help them to survive Houthis’ attacks?
@mariamtayob @PressTV you mean @khamenei_ir 	yes I agree, he thinks himself as the mighty.
@PressTV you pieces of shit, when exactly #Saudi Arabia did that?? 	you should be shamed if you call yourselves a journalists.
@RepRoKhanna then condemn Houthis’ operations that risk Yemenis’ lives.
@maydouglas63 @AJEnglish #SaudiArabia and other members of coalition are aiming to protect #Yemen from any risks that’ll drag the country into new level of disaster.
@Haredsom @AJEnglish ooh, so it became a game for Saudis?	and you’re saying that Houthis have nothing to do with that!
@AJEnglish any operations will be announced by coalition’s media center, not by some terrorist channel like you guys.
@UANI some companies never think of humanity, they only think of filling their pockets. 	no company or individual should deal with #IRGC anymore.
@UANI while the regime blames others of that war 😪 Arabs should stop the regime for once and all.
@NBCNews and that one could cause an environmental crisis if it succeeded.
@AhmadAlgohbary @ahmedbindaghar the president said it loud and clear, Houthis are the ones responsible for all humanitarian crisis and destruction in #Yemen.

@kay41981 @PressTV in your dreams bro, he’s a pussycat.
@justice_mankind @PressTV he’s a dumbass who’s a big mouth and thinks he can threaten the United States.
@PressTV I want you to tell me how #Iran will end the war? the regime is not match with the US forces.
@PressTV all reports you guys publish will be fake for sure. 	you can’t handle the truth whatsoever.
@TheEconomist @JKhashoggi FYI, this guy is pro #MuslimBrotherhood, the terrorist group that brought chaos to #Egypt years ago. 	any country would charges anyone who supports terrorists.
@AJENews you may say #Iran attacked the Saudi ships, not only Houthis. 	and #Qatar allies with Iranian regime in many fields 🤭
@mowali75 their attack barely hit the ship, but it’s procedures to prevent future crisis.
@RepRoKhanna again you never mentioned Iran’s presence in #Yemen or even its activities there.
@Sudano_Sucre @UNReliefChief @UN they’ve Iran by their side, a country that classified as the biggest sponsor of terrorism, the same one that’s trying to develop nukes.
@RepRoKhanna #SaudiArabia never rejected the ceasefire proposal, but Houthis didn’t commit to the deal.
@RepRoKhanna @kbsalsaud the only cause of that crisis is #Iran’s interfering in #Yemen’s affairs and supporting Houthis to start that civil war.
@MehrnewsCom just say that you cannot respond to facts ☺️
@rtcornwell @Ahura6666 @SecPompeo US has been one of the biggest supporters of freedom, and it won’t let the regime keep its aggressive activities and policies continue, so US will help the Iranians to change their government’s policies.
@FaranakAzad1 @SecPompeo @PahlaviReza Iranians want to live in peace with the world but the regime is making their lives more difficult to achieve that dream.
@SecPompeo as usual from the brutal regime we know. 	Iranians are living in fear and suffering from the activities of the regime in the country.
@Sudano_Sucre @UNReliefChief @UN I hope that too, but I don’t think Iran-backed Houthis will stop their aggression soon.
@UNReliefChief @UN did #Iran donate to #Yemen anything except the weapons that it smuggled to Houthis??
@froehlichhuahin @AJEnglish this’s the terrorists’ way to destabilize the region and the world in general by bombing oil shipments that belong to others.
@TScottRichey @AJEnglish and your account must be suspended.
#Iran and Houthis have history in attacking ships in that area, we didn’t forget those attacks which targeted the US’s &amp; Saudi’s ships. https://t.co/ssN9AwM1WV
@AJEnglish an attack made by Iran-backed Houthis, which poses a threat to all ships in the area.
@A_Jafarzadeh #Iran is using the deal to fund its terrorists operations that seek to destroy our homes.
@PressTV Ooh and who brought destruction into #Yemen? can Iranian regime answer the question without blaming others?
@ICRC #Yemen and #Syria have something in common: the Iranian’s presence that poses a great danger to civilians.
@PressTV @UNICEF the coalition will never ever attack or bomb something that will make live harder for Yemenis, but Houthis will do that so easily.
@AhmadAlgohbary because there was no one stoped the Iranian regime’s support for Houthis for the last three years until @POTUS came and threatened to make things right.
@AhmadAlgohbary why did that happen in the first place? the answer is simple: 	because of #Iran &amp; Houthis who terrified people and bombed them.
@stephenkalin they just started taking driving lessons, so they need times until they practice and have their licenses.
@billboard it’s the law and all should respect it.
@Afroholicness @AJEnglish and who’s supporting #Hamas with weapons? #Iran and #Qatar are one ones responsible for Palestinians’ misery.
@AJEnglish she meant #Qatar to be specific. 	Qatari regime has history of supporting Israeli figures and hosted them home.
@AJEnglish will Houthis stop their aggressive attacks and don’t bomb medical centers? 	I guess no as long as they’ve #Iran by their side.
@AJENews @AJEnglish look who’s talking 😂	since when #Iran committed to its word in negotiations!!
@imcorinnemec @RT_com the plane didn’t inform the coalition about its reasons that made it change its path.
@RT_com the plane changed its path suddenly, so it’s normal to force it to land after it ignored all attempts to make contacts.
@m3takl_en totally wrong. 	haters are the only ones who’ll see these reforms as a threat.
@RepRoKhanna @RepBarbaraLee what about the people who’re tortured and killed by Houthis? aren’t you gonna do something about that too?
@BalstyFromUSA @WFP @jonathandumont1 @WFP_MENA Houthis started the civil war by killing their own people and brothers, they don’t represent #Islam at all.
@WFP @jonathandumont1 @WFP_MENA my heart with all people who failed to escape from Houthis’ air strikes.
@UNICEFmena this tweet should be mentioned @HassanRouhani &amp; @khamenei_ir because they’re the ones who brought chaos in #Yemen.
@PressTV whatever #Iran does, sanctions will remain until the regime changes its foreign policies.
@carolecadwalla actually protests are exist in #Qatar but the regime suppressed all peaceful rallies there.
@KenRoth you became such a jerk!!	shame on you if you’re trying to cover up Iran’s ass and blame others.
@SenToddYoung @SenatorShaheen aren’t you gonna call #Iran to stop its interfering in #Yemen and supporting for Houthis?
@AJENews next time when you guys write a fake report, try to make it sense and reasonable.
@MStephensGulf it’s the Qatari regime who took the case and involved others in the gulf boycott.
@AJEnglish new attempt to cover his regime’s actions in funding terrorism.
@PressTV hope #Iran, this year, respects the #Hajj and don’t do anything that poses danger to pilgrims.
@Fact__Matters @Craig26222841 @SenSanders #Iran has attacked many countries over the past decades, and that includes United States. so yes America is already at war against #Iran’s regime.
@DeniGoekfromGer @SenSanders #Iran doesn’t have the power to protect itself in the first place. 	don’t worry, if there’ll be a WW3, it won’t be with #Iran
@SenSanders BTW, protecting the world has nothing to do with US election. 	can you focus on securing our safety from #Iran’s aggression?
@Shibuya34 @BahmanKalbasi tell me something, since when #Iran seeks to establish peace in Middle East?
@BahmanKalbasi his statement is so clear, no need to cover him up.
@FoxNews I guess @HassanRouhani has gotten things mixed up 😂 he should ask himself to stop threatening Middle East’s countries and never interfere in their affairs.
@PressTV are you guys trying to change the fact that you’ll lose if US starts a war against your regime?
@tedaduke @NBCNews Iranian regime’s power is a joke.
@Rrogerian @NBCNews since when #Iran’s regime looks for peace?	it only seeks to destroy everything.
@Joseph4Meg @NBCNews there can be no peace with a brutal regime like #Iran until it changes its violence policies in Middle East in general.
@NBCNews does he really think his regime can threaten the United States 🇺🇸!!! 😂	@POTUS needs only one missile to destroy the regime and free Iranians.
@FaranakAzad1 @ForeignAffairs @PahlaviReza US must be close to Iranians who seek to regime change.
@ForeignAffairs #Iran’s policies are so dangerous, and its people are sick of its aggression toward innocents people in #Yemen and #Syria.
@WalidPhares add #Yemen too. 	the regime is aiming to spread destruction all over the region in order to achieve their agendas.
@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump the regime of #Iran needs someone, like @POTUS, to stops them for once and all. 		we sick of their aggressive behaviors toward ME countries.
@WalidPhares @LindseyGrahamSC this’s one of the best news I’ve ever heard recently. 	so the regime needs to be careful about its next steps in its foreign policies or otherwise it’ll face tough consequences.
@MostafaMe4 @WalidPhares @RaymondArroyo the regime doesn’t have the power to launch any direct war, so it’ll use its militants to do their dirty work as usual.
@WalidPhares @RaymondArroyo international community must support people of #Iran to change their government’s foreign policies, and especially in Middle East where the regime funds the terrorism.
@WalidPhares Barack #Obama had to do that from the beginning before he made that awful deal with the regime.

@Reuters is he serious? 😂🤭 	his regime is too weak to launch a direct war, the regime will be destroyed if US launch at least one missile.
@PressTV #Iran doesn’t have the power to protect itself, that’s why it recruits terrorists to do its dirty work.
he can’t acknowledge his regime’s terrorists actions, but he don’t mind to play the victim role and announce to launch a war. https://t.co/9yfouW6Q9T
@AhmadAlgohbary and no mention about Iran-made missiles that targeted innocents women and children in their houses.
this’s how organizations misleading audiences, by publishing fake reports. https://t.co/kzOqkRSZZJ
@theIRC wrong!	#SaudiArabia has supported the Yemeni Central Bank to keep the prices low in order to let Yemenis have the ability to buy their needs.

@khamenei_ir because your regime is violating human rights, and your people are living in misery because of yours.

@JovankaSJ @amnesty why you didn’t say that you’ll contact officials in #SaudiArabia!! why specifically the #Saudi ambassador to #Canada?
@AhmadAlgohbary if Houthis didn’t attack civilians, we wouldn’t witness anything like what’s happening in #Yemen
@AhmadAlgohbary can you provide more information about when and where it happened!! if you’re talking truth.
@aalodah is that how you appreciate your country!!! shame on you.
@AlArabiya_Eng Qatari government should consider its people’s interests first, it has no right to prevent them to practice their religion.
@m3takl_en so you wanna force the government to release some traitors? you plan to go against the authorities? okey good luck.
@ciceline or he did understand the situation very well.
@JZarif FYI Mr. Foreign Minister, if your regime didn’t act aggressively by supporting terrorism in regime, we wouldn’t see this much of arms exports at all.
I like his attempts to play the victim here, but he forgot that the world knows everything happened in 9/11 and #Iran’s role in training and funding the hijackers who bombed the trading tower. https://t.co/zXxSfhleYn
@halone @JZarif so he tweeted a wise tweet because he said a lot of lies and tried to play the victim there! nice try.
@niloofar__s @JZarif yes, like stop feeding terrorists and training them.
@JZarif so US is destabilizing the world and #Iran not? 🤭😂	quit as FM and try to work as a comedian LOL.
@JZarif those arms exports are only to stop your regime’s aggressive operations in Middle East. 	so stop accusing others of your country’s actions.
@JZarif evidence say that the attack on 9/11 was planned by your regime, not #SaudiArabia. Just don’t deny it anymore.
@ChrisMurphyCT you’ve been criticized the coalition’s present, not a word about Iranian’s !!!!	I’m wondering which side you’re taking!
@Desert_Vox @PressTV to thank terrorists? are you out of your mind?
@PressTV not Yemeni forces, they’re Houthi forces who launched the failed attack.
@WalidPhares does it surprise you to see terrorists upset about #MBS’s new strategy!!
@WalidPhares the big question is what does Iranian regime want from #Syria?? new base for terrorism?
@mohdsalj it’s not surprising that #Saudi Arabia is helping #Yemen to surpass its humanitarian crisis, a crisis that classified as the world’s worst crises in history.	shame on Houthis.
@mohdsalj no one can deny the Saudi’s efforts to help #Yemen to survive its misery that was caused by Houthis and their ally, Iranian regime.
@mohdsalj as always, #SaudiArabia supports their brothers, the Yemenis, from the humanitarian crisis that made by Houthis &amp; Iranian regime.
I guess we all agree on that. 	#qatarbloodmoney https://t.co/04nZcr8NvX

@crimesofbrits U.S. seeks to establish peace in Middle East, that’s why it’s trying to help Yemenis &amp; Syrians from their crisis made by both Houthis and Assad regime.

@PeterTatchell that’s the Iranian regime. 	human rights groups should act ASAP to help Iranians.
@PressTV @khamenei_ir first of all, your regime needs to stop killing innocents people in #Yemen b before you start condemning Israeli violence.
@WSJ this operation may save the world after discovering that #Iran is still planning to develop nuclear weapons.
@MehrnewsCom #SaudiArabia welcomes any Muslim to perform Al Hajj, but #Iran should be careful about its attempts to destabilize pilgrimage.
@KenRoth should we be surprised! it’s normal while Houthis have bombed food &amp; medical warehouses.
@KenRoth why did he flee, specifically, into #Qatar ?? not other country? I’m wondering why 🤭
@KenRoth the greatest power of the world didn’t join the ICC, so no wonder if other didn’t join.
@DrMarcusP why should people protest against helping innocents people such as Yemenis &amp; Syrians!!
@Opokalypse @charliekirk11 yes, the people chose @realDonaldTrump over @HillaryClinton because they’re looking for new view of dealing with foreign states.
@charliekirk11 to be honest, there’re no real evidences to accuse #SaudiArabia of that sad incident. 	for Russia, they may did interfere in the election but no US officials introduced evidence to the public.
@AhmadAlgohbary that support #Saudi to kill civilians? 😄 	are you kidding me!!		#Iran is supporting Houthis to kill innocents in #Yemen and you blame other party?
@RoKhanna if your goal is to give #Yemen to #Iran and Houthis militants, just say it loud and clear without hiding behind pathetic claims.
@RoKhanna there’s no blockade there that harm Yemenis it prevent the humanitarian aids to reach them. Its only purpose is to make sure that there’s no way to struggle weapons to Houthis anymore.
@AhmadAlgohbary why do you blame #Saudi-led coalition for everything that happened in #Yemen while trying to cover up Houthis’ actions!!
@frankieboyle are you saying that #Iran and #Assad are one of your allies? because they’re the ones who committed war crimes against innocents people in #Yemen &amp; #Syria

@KenRoth if you keep tweeting like this way, you’ll lose your credibility soon. 	act like a real #HRW member and condemn the Iranian regime of its actions in #Yemen.
@KenRoth Saudis didn’t, Houthis did. 	I really don’t know why you insist to stand with militants and blame #SaudiArabia of innocents’ deaths and ignore the real killers.
@KenRoth at least he stood with Iranians who were betrayed by their government.
@ICRC people can’t reach these supplies because of Houthis’ militants who stole them and destroyed the receiving centers.

@KaiserS63479373 @PressTV in what exactly?
@PressTV partners in combating terrorism 😏 which terrifies your regime.
@AP prisons for brutal aggressive militants. 	I guess it’s the best way to stop terrorists without killing them.
@AhmadAlgohbary the moment you sold your soul to Houthis, you became one of them so you can’t recognize who’s killing the children and women of #Yemen
@amnesty it’s not surprising, since when #Iran’s regime cares about its people and their needs!!!

@innercitypress @antonioguterres that check was part of their humanitarian efforts they do for Yemenis, they don’t kill or bomb as you claimed.
@kalofye @ToEducate @mohdsalj because #Yemen were falling in hands of #Iran’s regime and Houthis. 		as a neighbor country, #SaudiArabia launched a coalition to save Yemenis.
@ToEducate sure. 	#Iran was behind both the coup and the attack on the presidential palace.
@MohammedAlBas15 @ICRC are you saying that Houthis didn’t kill and tortured any innocent?
@ICRC even if civilians went to safety places, Houthis will try to hunt them down 💔. 	unfortunately they’re brutal terrorists who betrayed their country and its people.
@AhmadAlgohbary @realDonaldTrump #Iran gives Houthis weapons, missiles and money which were in the first place should be used to enhance the country from inside and answer the Iranians’ needs.
@AhmadAlgohbary @realDonaldTrump the same way goes for #Iran. 	the regime has spent billions of dollars in supporting terrorists operations instead of using them to develop its economy.
@RepRoKhanna stop supporting means to give #Yemen to #Iran, the biggest sponsor state of terrorism. 		is that what you want?
@RepRoKhanna wrong! your administration doesn’t support war crimes, it does support efforts to establish peace in #Yemen by helping #Saudi-led coalition and Yemeni government.
@RoKhanna US’s decision to support the coalition was based on necessary purposes, and one of them was to stop Iranian regime’ aggressive operations and policies in region.
@RoKhanna without US &amp; #Saudi-led coalition, #Yemen would fall in hands of terrorists and #Iran. 	is that your goal?

@ChrisMurphyCT you can’t trust an organization that issues fake reports about what’s happening in #Yemen. 	who should overlook the port is Yemeni legitimate government only.
@ChrisMurphyCT the port has been used to smuggle weapons to terrorists of Houthis. 	those weapons was used to attack both civilians and #SaudiArabia.

@SecPompeo they need to change the regime. 	it’s their right to leave peacefully in region and strength ties with other countries.
@PressTV relax guys, it’s true 🤭☺️. 	#Saudi-led coalition has put its hands on the port and no longer you will deliver weapons again.
@SecPompeo do you think that a regime will respect people’s human rights?
@SecPompeo #Iran is a terrorist state, a radical regime that’s supporting &amp; funding terrorism. 	it’s no surprising that it beheading innocents people.
@BREAKING_PTV Yemeni forces!!!!!! 😂	you mean Houthis, the radical militants who you support.
@Yair_Rosenberg there’re no moves against human rights’ violations made by #Iran, Syrian regime &amp; Houthis in Middle East.
@SecPompeo @USUN @UN both Syrian &amp; Iranian regimes should hold responsibilities for their crimes against innocents people.
@SecPompeo @USUN @UN UN is not strong enough to side with innocents people in #Syria and #Yemen. 		in Syria, #Russia uses its veto to block any decision to help the people. 		and in Yemen, #Iran and Houthis are targeting innocents without any condemnation by UNSC.
@PIeaseSir @GiroudesqueXI BTW, #Russia won by luck and the advantages of playing in its land.
@GiroudesqueXI it’s football dude, not religious match!!
@ahmedbhutta011 @KenRoth If they did so, #Iran won’t be able to deliver weapons to terrorists anymore.
@KenRoth how funny is that!!	so the ones who help and support civilians are accused of making chaos in #Yemen. 	stop manipulating us with your lies.
@RedactedTonight because they know that Houthis are the ones who’re killing innocents people in #Yemen.
@EvaKBartlett yeah most media individuals blame US &amp; #SaudiArabia for what happened in #Yemen and ignore #Iran’s operations there, even though Iranian regime is supporting the war by providing weapons to militants.
@LilaGraceRose UN needs to be fixed! it should no longer protect #Israel against #Palestinians. 		UN must deal with the same standards with all nations.
@NRC_Egeland are you suggesting to hand over the port to radical Houthis?	are you insane?	did you think of what’ll happen if Houthis take control of the port?
@ICRC Houthis were trying to put their hands on the port to control all shipments and aids in order to make more suffering.
@ICRC yeah because Houthis will use any opportunity they see to make more damages among innocents people.
@SenFeinstein #Saudi-led coalition and US aren’t bombing civilians there, Houthis are. 		you need to support the Yemeni legitimate government to win against radical militants who have #Iran’s support.
@SenFeinstein are you satisfied with Houthis’ actions against innocents in #Yemen?
@cafreeland Yemenis have suffered unbelievable violence by #Iran-backed Houthis. 		we all seek to repack a political solution but #Iran keeps its funding for radical militants in #Yemen which keeps the fight on.
@RonPaul you need to be honest when you talk about humanitarian crisis!!		the ones who try to starving #Yemen are two sides:	1. Houthis militants. 	2. Their funder: Iranian regime.

@ChrisMurphyCT when will you act like a real senator who cares about American’s interests and condemn the Iranian regime’s actions in Middle East??
@ChrisMurphyCT one of the Saudi-led coalition’s goals is to make sure all Yemenis get the humanitarian aids, medicines, and food as much they need. 	coalition isn’t so reckless to bomb an important center on purpose.
@ChrisMurphyCT congratulations 👏🏼 finally an important account gave an attention to your silly tweets.
@ChrisMurphyCT US administration itself didn’t know about the new building, which go against your claims.
@ChrisMurphyCT and your claims based on what exactly? are you member of @MSF_USA ? or you just received those information from someone else?
@TulsiGabbard if you do so, Houthis &amp; Iranian agents will control the whole country and make it a failure state.
@TulsiGabbard you can’t ignore Houthis’ actions there against innocents who suffered their attacks.
@TulsiGabbard and who prevent the humanitarian aids to reach Yemenis? Houthis for sure. 	they try to block the aids and sell it to the people or give it for free for those who support them.
@davidicke no way the coalition will allow Houthis to control the port with all humanitarian aids that arrive there.
@TulsiGabbard are you ignoring Houthis’ roles in attacking innocents by Iranian missiles?
@TulsiGabbard why you didn’t mention #Iran’s role in #Yemen in escalating the war there by providing weapons and missiles to Houthis!!
@repmarkpocan US needs to protect its interests in Middle East, and helps its allies there, therefore it supports the coalition’s operations in #Yemen where it fight against Houthis and Iranian regime.
@repmarkpocan @justinamash @RepRoKhanna @RepThomasMassie @RepBarbaraLee @RepWalterJones @RepTedLieu @RepMcGovern @RepJayapal @keithellison @RepRaulGrijalva remember that if you allowed to Houthis to control the port, you’ll put an end for #Yemen’s future.
@LeeCamp coalition has helped Yemenis with humanitarian aids and establish medical centers for free. 		ask Houthis militants why they are insisting on attacking innocents there.
@LeeCamp they kill over 10 million people in #Yemen!! so funny 😂	you can’t convince anyone with such pathetic claims as you said.

@PressTV your news cannot be trusted as long as you guys do help Houthis to attack Yemenis and blame others for it.
@trevortimm #NorthKorea poses a threat to US’s and others’ security while it was developing nuclear weapons.

@samueloakford I don’t know why #iran insists to make the situation more difficult to others.
@KvanOosterom @PJKleiweg @DutchMFA @NLatUN Houthis used to attack civil sites and medical centers and blamed the coalition for it. 		#Yemen has suffered a lot from Iranian regime &amp; Houthis.
@KvanOosterom @PJKleiweg @DutchMFA @NLatUN FYI, #Iran doesn’t want the civil war in #Yemen to end soon, that’s why it provides weapons and missiles to Houthis.
@ChrisMurphyCT the coalition supports @MSF_USA with everything they need to help Yemenis and end cholera diseases.
@ChrisMurphyCT Saudi Arabia is helping with humanitarian aids and food, there’s no point of destroying the treatment center. 	I don’t believe in such things.

@Maddllock2 @GarethPorter Mr. @GarethPorter tried to make the situation like it was the coalition’s fault without giving any condemnation of #Iran’s activities there.
@Maddllock2 @GarethPorter Yemenis are suffering from two things:	1. the Iranian regime’s agendas in region. 	2. the Houthis’ attempts to over take the country, and of course with help from Iran.
@Sinizt3r1 @BenjaminNorton funny 😄 	I understand that #Iran is a peaceful state! never think of hurting anyone! so funny.
@MirrorPolitics those activities aren’t victims, be aware of that. 	they contacted with foreign agents against #SaudiArabia, and the latest has the right to protect its stability and society.
@Rob_Malley Houthis’ actions toward their country is something unacceptable, coalition and US want to save the future of #Yemen by stopping the Houthis &amp; Iranian regime.
@Rob_Malley isn’t your duty as president &amp; CEO of @CrisisGroup is to condemn the Houthis’ attacks on Yemenis?
@Sinizt3r1 @BenjaminNorton ooh really!! so #Iran is the good friend of Yemenis who bombed them several times.
@moslemi_fatima @AhmadAlgohbary 85 times 😪 my turn now, are you serious?!	the attack you mentioned was a fake one and there’s an anonymous reporter explored the truth and what really happened.
@SameeraKhan @steve37341 working together? when? what agreements they have?
@DailySabah #Qatar has a history of supporting terrorists organizations and the idea of having s-400 system poses a threat to the whole region.
@BenjaminNorton that’s a huge number and we should not be silent toward Iran’s &amp; Houthis’ activities in #Yemen
@BenjaminNorton children dies because of Houthis’ actions in blocking the aids to reach people in need + their ideology of bombing hospitals and medical centers.
@UNHCRYemen Yemenis have suffered a lot from Houthis’ coup that lead to the current crisis, I hope their misery end soon.
@GarethPorter war of starvation by coalition? ha ha	so tell me what are Houthis doing in #Yemen? don’t tell me that they deliver humanitarian aids to civilians!
@ChrisMurphyCT who fooled you and said #SaudiArabia is attacking civilians in #Yemen and ignoring all international laws?		I admit it now, you’re piece of sh!t
@ChrisMurphyCT okey you are so funny 👏🏼. 	you must quit your position as senator and work in a stand up comedy club 👌🏼
@joshua_landis there’s no coup at that moment, actually there was none at all!!	I don’t know why media like to talk about fake stories and ignore what’s really happened?
@SmargJones @ra495kIvoJVipyF @Roland_Jenkins @CNN #Islam is asking Muslims to respect and listen to their leaders -except the forbidden ones- and those activists went against their country and stabbed it in the back.
@Roland_Jenkins @CNN they’re all under investigation, freed activists will be in touch with authorities but they won’t be allowed to speak to media or anyone else about the case until it’s over.
@NPR at least the princess didn’t betrayed her country and contacted with foreign organizations!!
@AhmadAlgohbary I agree that #Yemen needs help but Houthis don’t want to make it happen!!	the militants are driving the country into a deeper crisis with every day passes.
@AhmadAlgohbary just keep in mind that #ISIS never threatened #Iran!	#Iran was their source of funding.
@AhmadAlgohbary Saudi Arabia didn’t bomb #Yemen, it attacks Houthis’ bases and protecting its security. 	stop manipulating people by using your ideology.
@RT_com and who’s said that Saudis will replacing mosques with movie theaters??
@RT_com doesn’t #AlQaeda target people in mosques and bomb them???
RT @atiku: I had a fruitful discussion today in Makkah with Sobhi Batterjee, Chairman of Saudi German Hospital. Our collaboration will enha…
@PeterTatchell @P4HR don’t forget that Houthis used to intercept all humanitarian aids and prevent them to reach civilians in need.
@Haroon_osmani @Reuters which kind of problems?
@Reuters I’m pretty sure if #Qatar did it, it would be #Iran’s order.
@TheCurrentCBC @HZayadin ludicrous!? 	protecting stability and security isn’t something you can ignore at all. 	it doesn’t matter who is he/she but if anyone tries to destabilize the society, they’ll hold consequences for their actions.
@KenRoth hypocrisy!! so the meaning of reforms you now is to let traitors to do whatever they want with whoever they want!		you’re the real hypocrite here.
@AhmadAlgohbary @BorisJohnson journalism is about honesty &amp; telling truth, and that’s what you should do, not to mislead audiences.
@ajplus activists you’re talking about are in jail for different reasons and you can google it.
@Ali_H_Soufan nope it won’t. 	Saudi forces are protecting the port from Iran-backed Houthis who wants to destroy it in order to make a new disaster in #Yemen.
@Dr_E_Kendall Saudi Arabia has always cared about #Yemen future, stability and everything that is in Yemenis interests.
@BaFana3 that’s a sign of Houthis’ defeat ☺️ and maybe that’s #Iran new policy in #Yemen

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump isn’t better to discuss issues that matters to Americans instead of tweeting claims about Saudi Arabia!!	Americans deserve your attention.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump I wish you don’t involve #SaudiArabia in every American’s issues just to achieve your suspicious agendas.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump correction:	#Saudi Arabia did gather families’ members with each other. on the other hand, Qatar did kick out its citizens after it withdrew their nationality and citizenship.
@markcurtis30 the only war crimes committed in #Yemen are those missiles and bombs that Houthis use to attack civilians.
@markcurtis30 is so clear that UK doesn’t participate in the coalition and it’s only supporting the Saudis to protect their borders from #Iran-made missiles that launched by Houthis.
@PressTV killer was a terrorist, and you guys know that very well.
@sarahleah1 why do you describe the situation like they’re victims!!
@Ali_H_Soufan rational activists act in a way that serves their country, not like those traitors who betrayed their country and people.
@haaretzcom missing Prince?? do you guys call yourselves a media reporters!	#Saudi Crown Prince was seen yesterday with @KingSalman when they received other princes and citizens.
@haaretzcom there’s no place for Iran in peaceful #Iraq future. 	Iraqis had enough of suffering and displacement.
@haaretzcom #Iran made the civil war in #Iraq and helped its militants to give the country to #ISIS.
@jricole those are part of reforms that Saudis are looking for. 	no place for traitors or harassing people among the society.
@SameeraKhan actually #Iran is hosting #Taliban leaders and members, it even gives them money and training and everything they need to finish the plans.
@KenRoth why you insist to make the case about human rights’ activists? it’s about protecting the country from intruders.
@AhmadAlgohbary are you sure both trucks were carried aluminum and cans? wasn’t there any weapons smuggled within those two trucks.
@ajplus it is and it’ll continue its reforms and stop any potential crisis may happen in future.
@PressTV ooh really? so UN didn’t mention the Iranian’s roles there?
@RoKhanna @RepBarbaraLee Houthis are targeting civilians in Yemen by using Iranian weapons and blame coalition of what’s happening!	we shouldn not allow Iranian regime to support Houthis anymore.
@RoKhanna @RepBarbaraLee one side is torturing Yemenis there, the Houthis. 	go to #Yemen and you’ll see the truth by yourself.
@KenRoth you already know that it’s part of Saudi Arabia’s reforms, to protect the society is part of reforms.
@KenRoth which activists you’re talking about? you mean those who betrayed their own country and followers and worked with foreign groups to destabilize the country from inside!
@khamenei_ir it wasn’t predication, it’s planned from the beginning by The regime of #Iran. 		don’t play the victim role here and act like you’ve been betrayed.
@khamenei_ir you wanted US to withdrawal from the deal to keep your activities running publicly, you wish came true and now it’s your regime’s chance to do whatever it wants without any fear.
@khamenei_ir it doesn’t matter what US does because your regime had no intention of stopping its policies and activities in Middle East.
@Reuters UN asks for more information that’s all, don’t make the situation like they’re victims.
@khamenei_ir stop acting like you’ve a noble goals! you’re a war criminal and you should hold accountable for your actions.
@khamenei_ir don’t you think you’re causing chaos by forcing your regime’s revolutionary ideals on region? or even your people!!
@khamenei_ir Ooh really!!	you mean your policies that caused wars and disasters won’t stop!
@KenRoth they targeted and bombed innocents in Yemen because they didn’t join their militia forces.
@KenRoth Houthis sometimes obstruct!!!!!!!	are you kidding me??	Houthi forces are behind every tragedy and crisis in #Yemen.
@KenRoth why you’re so upset about what’s happening in #Saudi Arabia?	reforms doesn’t mean to allow traitors to manipulate Saudi citizens and destabilizing the society
@KTHopkins terror attacks has nothing to do with Islam and building mosques. 	#SaudiArabia is interesting in strengthening ties with various religious while Iranian regime declares war against them.
@Dr_Ulrichsen both Saudis and Lebanon PM denied that! I guess France’s president want to make a show by claiming that fake story.
@ajplus because it wants to send a clear message to all those who plans to destabilizing the country that it’ll do whatever it takes to secure the safety of Saudis.
@ahmed his statement is totally misleading!! he shouldn’t claim such fake things as a president.
@AhmadAlgohbary Houthis are attacking the port and blaming Saudis 😂 how pathetic is that 😂
@MarkAmesExiled how you claim Saudi-led coalition did cause cholera epidemic while it gives humanitarian aids to Yemenis. 	FYI, those aids cost billions of dollars.
@iyad_elbaghdadi a campaign for traitors? this’s gonna fail as usual because you won’t fool Saudi citizens like those traitors did.
@PressTVPrograms struggle to take control? don’t make me laugh 🤭 		both countries are helping Yemenis by protecting their territories and training soldiers.
@bohlool_dana @MazJobrani @therealroseanne @TheEllenShow it’s obvious that Iranian regime is the one that supports the civil war in Yemen by giving Houthis the tools to target civilians there.
@bohlool_dana seriously? 😂	what’s #Iran’s roles then! didn’t Iran fund and train terrorists and support terrorists organizations?
@AhmadAlgohbary your efforts to blame others to stop their support for Saudi-led coalition are exposed and clear 😄. 	try harder 👍🏼
@Ola_Salem they can do whatever they want but in the end they will admit their mistakes and return to their rationality.
@BenjaminNorton there’s no point of keeping your efforts to blame Saudis for committing unreal strikes or targeting innocents people.

@MiddleEastEye all this tragedy caused by both Iranian regime and Houthis militants who tried to bring destruction in Yemen with no mercy.
@PressTV cowards attacks are one of #iran brands.
@7yhy pro-Qatar agents 😂	they’re trying to blame Saudis for everything 😂
@PressTV ooh really? where’re your proofs? when you try to blame someone, you should bring evidence to support your claims.
@KenRoth what about Iranian people’s right? ooh I forgot you’re paid to campaign against #SaudiArabia
@KenRoth are you using your position to spread others’ agendas? in that case you’ve no right to talk about human rights while you ignore the lives of millions in Saudi Arabia who were fooled by some so-called activists.
@KenRoth it has nothing to do with women’s driving, they accused of contacting with foreign groups to destabilize the country from inside!!
@KenRoth a hypocrite is the one who ignores the truth and keep saying what support his agendas like you mr. Roth

@waheedparker @FaisalbinFarhan @mohdsalj I’ll give you two reasons:	1. Saudis are protecting their borders from Houthis &amp; Iranian attacks. 	2. they responded to Yemeni legitimate government’s request to help it against Houthis militants. 		and UN is aware of every move made by coalition.
@khamenei_ir what about your regime’s issues? yours did interfere in others’ affairs in region and support terrorists attacks and operations.
@waheedparker @FaisalbinFarhan @mohdsalj nope, Houthis target children and women to make it as coalition did that.

@RoKhanna do you consider Yemenis’ suffering from Iran-backed Houthis’ attacks?		you should support your administration in its plans in #Yemen.
@RoKhanna in #Yemen civil wars, Houthis -with Iran help- are using civilians as human shields, ignoring all international laws.
@RoKhanna US and its allies in Middle East are helping Yemenis by protecting and giving them humanitarian aids, while #Iran and Houthis making the situation more worse than ever.
@BREAKING_PTV I don’t know why you insist on spreading fake news while everyone else knows the truth?
@iyad_elbaghdadi the same goes for Iranian women unless the regime has another opinion.
@iyad_elbaghdadi biggest fear! really?	Saudi women has the right to wear their headscarves or not, it’s their choice.
@AhmadAlgohbary Houthis’ boats? if yes, then I doubt they’re fishing.
@UNReliefChief Houthis broke their promises in allowing access of humanitarian aids to Yemenis, they blocked the aids in order to sell them and use the money for their operations.
@PressTV are you going to blame Saudis for that too?
@guardian key agents who work for foreign organizations that aim to destabilize #Saudi Arabia.
@charliekirk11 who funded and trained 9/11 terrorists is #Iran. 	we agree some of them were Saudis but they were against Saudi Arabia.
@RandPaul arms race? your country has been threatened by Iranian regime that chants for “death to America”, it’s clear US administration will stand with its allies to combat Iranian danger.
@ramprasad_c #Iran has beheaded thousands of innocents, if #SaudiArabia will use it position, it will sanction Iranian regime but that’s not easy to do.
@hibahastam @noornymar @Babak_1992 @SecPompeo @PahlaviReza we know that Iran used the money it got from #IranNuclearDeal to fund and support its radical activities and militants. people didn’t have any access to that money.

@SecPompeo I don’t know what’s #iran goal after its plans to destabilize the region and run its nuclear program!!
@RoKhanna so you want to see Yemen controlled by terrorists like Iranians and Houthis? do you even care about Yemenis? their future?
@State28Progress @RoKhanna US wants to protect its interests in Middle East so it shares the same values with its allies there to counter the Iranian aggression.
@RoKhanna yes, Saudis alongside UAE are caring about Yemen’s future and they want to make sure it won’t fall in militias hands.
@RandPaul so Saudis are the problematic actor in ME? seriously!!	so how do you describe Iran’s roles there?
@RandPaul okey what’s going to happen later if you succeed to stop the arms sales? will #Iran stop its activities in Middle East? will Houthis stop their attacks on civilians in Yemen?	you can’t guarantee that because you know it won’t happen.
@RandPaul do you know what’s going in Middle East? do you know a country called #Iran? do you know what’s its roles there?
@cafreeland every country has the rights to defend its security and stability. 	even #Canada will do the same if someone poses a threat to its own security.
@cafreeland in other words, they’re traitors 👎🏼
@cafreeland there’s no peaceful activist among them, they planned with foreign groups to destabilize the country in specific affairs.
@DrJillStein GCC countries and UN did send humanitarian aids to Yemen but Houthis blocked the ways and attacked humanitarian workers.
@DrJillStein it’s obvious US administration and its allies trying to secure the region and prevent the danger of Iran to reach Yemenis and their future.
@DrJillStein actually he’s right.	Iran has supported and funded all conflicts in Middle East and even encouraged terrorists groups to even involve into those wars.
@DrJillStein I don’t understand your point of view, with all evidences that Iran has been the biggest sponsor of terrorism and destruction in Middle East, you still defending the regime??
@DrJillStein so you’re saying #Iran isn’t posing a threat to world’s security and safety? the #IranNuclearDeal is limiting the danger of Iran regime?	nonsense!!
@KenRoth who told you they don’t have lawyers? they’re being under investigation so no body have access to them but their lawyers.
@BenjaminNorton there’s no point of that while Saudi Arabia is the most country donates food and humanitarian aids. 	then it’s not correct that Saudis target food sites.
@BenjaminNorton wrong. 	Houthis tried to starve Yemenis in order to establish their goals like blaming Saudis for chaos in Yemen.
@apmoorehead #SaudiArabia don’t need these PRs because its efforts to establish peace and stability have been admitted by all countries expect the ones that don’t want to see peace in Middle East.
@markcurtis30 you never mentioned Iran-made missiles that killed thousands of innocents in Yemen over the last 3 years.
@AJENews alleged? 😂	still trying to defend them!	is #Qatar has the same response to US decision?
will #Iran think of its people’s future after latest sanctions!? https://t.co/qGUky1KD2O
@Saudi_Bodyguard do you know what’s coming in future?
@WSJ there’s no need to worry about. 	what happened week ago was part of cleaning up the society from traitors and foreign agents.
@PressTV #Saudi Arabia cares about safety of its people and guests, and it investigated what happened and made sure it won’t happen again.
@KabirTaneja those traitors you mentioned are people who stab their country from the back and disappointed their followers.
@KabirTaneja why’d he have serious troubles? I see it from another aspect! people will praise him because of his reforming efforts that end a lot of corruption and betraying.
@charliekirk11 #Iran has been headed thousands of innocents just because of they expressed their needs and asked the government to stop its aggressive policies in region.
@charliekirk11 total and complete evil?	first, your tweet full of lies.	second, why you didn’t tweet about the crackdown against innocents Iranian people by their regime?
@charliekirk11 where’s your sources? show me some links that talk about your claims? 		you need to check your sources before tweeting fake news!
@margheritamvs @LoujainHathloul @azizayousef @Saudiwoman this whole situation is belong to Saudis affairs, and charges not normal ones. 		they worked as agents for foreign organizations! unforgivable!!
@AJENews to hurt Qatar? Iran is the one who aiming to divide the unity of GCC. 		Qatar left the GCC to to become a toy in Iran’s hands.
@KenRoth Houthis &amp; Iranian agents are the ones who attack civilians and innocents in Yemen. 	#saudiarabia is helping Yemenis there from terrorists attacks.
@Joyce_Karam @Heritage finally we saw a tough American Secretary State who’ll stop the Iranian regime’s radical activities.
@WalidPhares + Iranian regime doesn’t decide for Iranian people’s future.
@WalidPhares funny, since when the regime thinks of others’ life!! they decide for themselves without caring about others.
@JZarif you acted like you’re committed 100% to the deal while you actually used it as a cover for its activities.
@JZarif your regime used the deal for its own agendas in funding terrorist organizations and prevent Iranians from having any advantages.
@SecPompeo I don’t think Iranian regime’s dictators will understand the American message, in fact they are aiming to ignore all international laws and commitments.
@SecPompeo Iranian regime doesn’t care about any deal or commitments, they don’t even care about their own people’s future. 	the international community should help the Iranian people and save them from their brutal regime.
@SecPompeo @Heritage #Iran must not get nuclear weapons or develop ballistic missiles because if it did then it’ll be used against countries in region in the first place then it’ll attack US facilities in Middle East.
@SecPompeo Iranian regime took advantages of the deal to support its radical actions in Middle East and fund all terrorist operations that launched against innocents people.
@SecPompeo Iranian people are the victims of their country’s regime that used its economy to support terrorists groups.
@SecPompeo @POTUS Totally agree 👌🏼. 	#IranDeal didn’t secure US’s interests in region.
@AJEnglish @hrw is looking for anything that supports the Iranian agendas, but they didn’t praise what Saudis did to protect their country.
@lrozen I’m sure US administration is watching what’s going on and supporting the Saudi’s moves.
@NBCNews wait!! did you guys know the activists you’re talking about are people who betrayed their country and contacted with foreign entities.

@AhmadAlgohbary don’t forget to mention that Saudi Arabia is hosting thousands of Yemenis who escaped Houthis’ aggression.
@AhmadAlgohbary and who displaced them? Houthis did when they took over the country and launched a war against the government and its people.
@AhmadAlgohbary #SaudiArabia and UAE are sending humanitarian aids weekly under UN supervision.
@AhmadAlgohbary the whole humanitarian crisis were caused by Houthis who blocked all ways for aids to reach civilians in Yemen.

hi 😌 https://t.co/IJ9GHp4O01
@jjz1600 it’s good that Houthis didn’t target them or blow them up.
@AhmadAlgohbary I’m glad that Houthis didn’t use the chance and attack them by missiles or explosions.
@AliAbunimah yes they’re suffering from Houthis attacks and thinking of their Palestinians brothers. 	they’re really strong.
@DrJillStein at least @realDonaldTrump is better than @BarackObama who made a horrible deal with Iranian regime.
@iyad_elbaghdadi @LoujainHathloul @Saudiwoman @azizayousef is there any official statement about what you claim? if not then it’s a fake one just to have the world’s attention to unimportant things.

@basha_ie @AlyaaGad @LoujainHathloul @azizayousef @Saudiwoman figure it out by yourself.

@mechael1717 @hiddensilence_1 @AhmadAlgohbary justice that guarantees terrorists like Houthis never rule or control Yemen.
@AhmadAlgohbary don’t care who’s gonna rule? seriously??	they can’t be safe under Houthis’ rule, no one can.
@DailySabah I guess it’s bad news for some people who believed those rumors.
@Ndawsari you want them to leave in order to open the way for Houthis to come and control it? to make it a new base for their operations?		no way!!
@PressTV he attended some events this month publicly, you can’t lie about that too 😂

@DailySabah #Hezbollah, #MuslimBtotherhood, and other terrorist groups should be sanctioned by all world’s countries, not only US and Gulf countries!! #Turkey needs to follow the moves.

@AP good move by US administration👍🏼	we hope #Iran can understand its situation before it’s too late.
@AhmadAlgohbary why you didn’t help them then!
@AhmadAlgohbary the worst thing in wars is to use people’ suffering for your own agendas!	shame on you.
@SteveSchmidtSES all chaos and destruction in Middle East caused by terrorist organizations funded and supported by #Iran. 	look at Iran’ roles in region and you’ll see that it has been the biggest sponsor of destruction.
@SameeraKhan that’s not correct! #Canada cares about safety and stability in Middle East, and it’ll do whatever it takes to establish peace there, even if it sells weapons to #Saudi Arabia to protect Yemenis.
@ForeignPolicy @realDonaldTrump did the right thing when he announced to withdraw from the deal, because Iranian regime is the one who gets benefits from it by funding its dangerous activities.
@ForeignPolicy what does the world get from #IranDeal? nothing but disaster and chaos in some countries!!

@AhmadAlgohbary so you’re taking advantage for any incident took place for your own agenda!!	Yemen has been in civil war for years and coalition is going to end the war by defeating #Iran &amp; Houthis.
@HillelNeuer a hero? since when?	he challenged the laws and insulted Islam, why you recognize him as a hero when he’s now paying for his own actions!
@Joyce_Karam both countries opened new chapter in their relationship after what #Iran did to ruin their relationship for years.
@thedailybeast Iran is the main source of wars in Middle East, that’s why @realDonaldTrump withdrawal from the deal that Iran used to destabilize the region.
@Ndawsari it was misunderstanding between Yemeni officials and UAE, and now it’s over before terrorists take advantages of it.
@RepRoKhanna #Iran regime is supporting terrorists groups in Yemen, Libya, Lebanon, Egypt, and Bahrain. US administration took the leadership to combat terrorism all over the region and gulf countries -except Qatar- are helping your country.
@RepRoKhanna try to say something that makes sense, Iranian regime helped Houthis to take down the legitimate government in Yemen and launched missiles attacks on civilians &amp; #SaudiArabia.
@RepRoKhanna each country has its own interests in region, even your country. Iran &amp; Houthis once targeted Americans ships and tried to blow them up, and you said #Saudis dragged it to civil war??
@AJEnglish yes it’s over, no chance for you to make them disagree anymore.
@Afrahnasser both sides reached a deal, so why are you so upset about it!!
@hisham_melhem #Israel think it has US support in its side, and it’s wrong!	US administration won’t keep silent on that shoutings.
@erelija @statedeptspox #Isreal &amp; Houthis went so far with its actions against Palestinians and Yemenis. 		president @realDonaldTrump should condemn their policies in public and made his final decision.
@statedeptspox Houthis’ will continue their aggressive moves against civilians there until someone like @realDonaldTrump come and stop them.
@theIRC the blood of children death in #Yemen is on Houthis’ hands. 	#UN needs to do something toward Houthis’ actions against Yemenis innocents.
@brhodes the deal didn’t stop #Iran policies or its activities, instead it used the the deal to extend its presence in region and threatened other countries.
@ColinKahl BTW, #Iran has spreading its revolutionary message decades ago, it established #Hezbollah &amp; #Brotherhood organizations.
@YousefMunayyer you’re talking to former CIA director! the guy who’s all information he needs, don’t think he’ll ignore the reality of Iranian regime.
@YousefMunayyer #Iran has funded #Hezbollah and trained its members for decades, facts don’t lie!!
RT @SecPompeo: On Sunday shows I discussed withdrawal from JCPOA: To suggest that’s driving Iranian conduct in Yemen, the rise of Hezbollah…
@SecPompeo it’s time to stop the brutal regime who has denied its actions in #Yemen. 	I’m pretty sure the US administration will end the era of dictatorship in #Iran and free its people.
@SecPompeo exactly, Iranian regime though they can do whatever they want as long the deal is in place. 		their aggressive policies are no longer acceptable!!
@ColinKahl imposing sanctions won’t be enough, we need to cut all its sources that used to fund terrorism and attacks.
finally we got someone who’ll stop the regime forever and bring peace to our world. https://t.co/wwggwKRorU
@realDonaldTrump you’re right, the Iranian regime took advantage of the deal to destabilize the whole region and fund terrorist operations.
@PressTV and Iran is helping Yemen? bullshit!!	your regime is responsible for everything happened in #Yemen
@OMGno2trump another lesson:	- all 19 terrorists were trained in #Iran.	- bin Laden had Iran’s support all time.
@Jabergdwah @BREAKING_PTV it’ll be free when #Iran stops its dirty acts there.
@Mhdaralbar @BREAKING_PTV @Loubylass if Houthis accept to dialogue with legitimate government to reach a political solution.
@BREAKING_PTV I like your ways in misleading people :)	just say there’re 4 Houthis.
@markcurtis30 if it did launch that attack, it’ll announce it publicly, but until this moment there’s no evidence that the coalition did attack civilians.
@KenRoth sometimes I think @hrw is overlooking what Iranian regime do to its people! is your organization afraid of that regime?
@KenRoth BTW, China has the largest rate of executions, I didn’t see you condemn them!! I’m wondering why.
@KenRoth reforms don’t mean to overlook the terrorists’ actions!!	each country has its own way to punish terrorists and killers.
@CharlieAngusNDP @JustinTrudeau those sales are the main reason why Houthis didn’t occupied Yemen until now.
@LeeCamp @Truthdig US needs a president who’s guts to protect the American interests in Middle East. 	Obama hadn’t, unlike Trump.
@BenjaminNorton and more work to do to stop the Iranian regime’s influence in region.
@abcdaee198 activists are getting paid to throw the blame on Arab coalition just to save the Houthis’ ass
@abcdaee198 you can’t blame Saudis for Houthis’ actions!! terrorists are targeting Yemenis civilians and tell the media it’s the coalition’s action.
@Ndawsari funny!! 	from one hand it cares about safety of Yemenis and from other hand it helps #Assad’s regime to kill Syrians with chemical weapons!
@LeventEler is #Turkey really concerning about Yemenis while it supports the Syrian regime to kill its people?
@K_Beckerle @UNHumanRights is Trump’s decision to withdraw from #IranDeal has anything to do with this increase of deaths in #Yemen?		I guess it’s the Iranian way to send a message to US administration.
@WalidPhares so #Iran is doing its best to have its influence in #Yemen
@MsJulieLenarz sure, if #Iranian regime succeeds to have nukes, then each country in Middle East and abroad will be in danger!!
@RepRoKhanna you must act, as senator, to help people, not terrorists!!		stop supporting the coalition means to give the militants the upper hand.
@RepRoKhanna US administration never said it accepts war crimes, but it admitted #Saudi efforts to end civil war in #Yemen.
@hasanthehun #Iran seeks to start a war by its interfering in others’ internal affairs. 		US administration won’t allow that regime to keep its policies which will destroy everything.
@hasanthehun #Iran didn’t compliant 100%!! it used the deal to cover its activities in Middle East that destabilized the whole region.
@SeanKellyMEP that’s why we should change the deal or kill it.
@SeanKellyMEP the deal is allowing terrorists to attack us, #Iran is using its money to fund terrorist operations and activities.

@AJEnglish now Iranian regime cannot use the island to blockade the humanitarian aids or ships, or even to launch its operations.
@AJEnglish the legitimate government gave the green light to UAE to use the island and protect it before #Iran put its dirty hands on it.
@AhmadAlgohbary @theresa_may still whining? do you think you can deceit the world with some lies while everyone knows who really is targeting the innocents in #Yemen!!
@davereaboi Obama administration failed to stop Iranian regime’s aggressive policies in region, Obama himself let the world down when he approved the deal and encourage it.
@TarekFatah you still repeating this one 😂💔 poor man.
@RoKhanna Saudi Arabia is working with humanitarian workers and organizations to help Yemeni people who escaped from Houthis’ missiles.
@amnesty every country has its own ways to punish terrorists and killers. 	you can’t force your view and ask everybody to do act as you like.
@chehayebk @Reuters_SarahW France, Canada, UK, and US are helping Yemeni legitimate government and Saudi-led coalition to counter the danger of Iran &amp; Houthis where they tortured and killed civilians in #Yemen.
I can’t stop laughing for this one 😂💔	@HassanRouhani @JZarif @khamenei_ir 	#IranDeal https://t.co/EzldLvd1hv
@JZarif #IranDeal didn’t stop your regime’s aggressive behaviors in Middle East that caused destruction all over the region.
@JZarif great powers won’t let #Iran to support terrorist organizations by money from #IranDeal.
@JZarif your regime used #IranDeal to finance your terrorist operations instead of enhancing your economy for Iranian people
RT @AlArabiya_Eng: #Saudi FM: Iran-planned #Houthi attacks do not affect kingdom’s stability https://t.co/wBa6gJiRF8 https://t.co/8NlvOMI9Io
@mhdksafa the civil wars must end immediately, the people are the ones who suffer its consequences.
@WFPChief @WFP it’s their duty toward another gulf country and both countries won’t let #Yemen fall in hand of terrorists.
@KenRoth Saudi Arabia never aims to bomb #Yemen, it’s only targeting Houthi militants who launched terrorist attacks on civilians.
@RT_com #Islam is a peaceful religious, but that doesn’t mean to build churches in#Saudi Arabia.
@CAATuk this move will help Houthis and other terrorists to expand their influence in region.
@AhmadAlgohbary were the missiles made in #Iran?
@PressTV so what?? terrorists need people to eliminate them to protect the world.
@rulajebreal US forces targeted Houthis’ targets, so who said it attacked civilians?	we shouldn’t believe our enemies or people who’re sympathetic to them.
@alihmourad @WFP seriously?? then Saudi &amp; UAE officials become war criminals instead of blaming Houthis &amp; Iranian regime!!		gulf countries are doing their best to save #Yemen and prevent it to fail in hands of terrorists.
@BBCJLandale @CAATuk #SaudiArabia won’t use any weapons against civilians, that’s why UK is making arms deals with Saudis.
@BBCJLandale @CAATuk you should be worried about Houthis’ actions against Yemeni people who suffered a lot from militants.

@KenRoth Canada knows that Houthis are the ones who’re killing their Yemenis brothers. 	you’re a senior activist, you’ve no right to mislead others.
@SangkulRimbas @PressTV what about change itself first!! to convert from sponsor of terrorism to peaceful country.
@RoKhanna do you have evidences to support your claim? I mean if #Saudi is killing innocents in #Yemen as you said!!
@LindseyGrahamSC some terrorists are mislead people who’re brainwashed. 	maybe in spending some time in prison + taking some advice, they’ll regret their past.
@AngeloJohnGage does #ISIS ever attack #Iran? the answer is no, never happened. 	Iranian regime has got their interests to support their other ally regime, just to extend their present and operations.
@LarrygHaynes3 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage they’re reveled and didn’t provide any links to Saudi Arabia, your former president admitted that also.
@SebastienYC_FR @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage then explain how come the leader of AlQaeda is staying right now in #Iran?
@LarrygHaynes3 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage they recruited Sunnis to blame them for their actions, simple fact. 	also who says #Hamas and #Hezbollah never threatened USA??? most of terrorist operations launched by any groups #Iran supports.
@rob8211 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage ask him @khamenei_ir 	he’ll explain to you how his agents did that.
@SandraVona @colmjocarroll @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage Obviously their regime’s forcing them to do that. https://t.co/CWFTestgrI
@LarrygHaynes3 @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage of course he does ☺️ Iranian regime has been the biggest sponsor of terrorism for decades and still.
@SebastienYC_FR @LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage he didn’t have the evidences like Trump administration do, but now the world knows for sure that Iranian regime is behind all terrorist operations.
@LeandraCme @AngeloJohnGage who trained and funded those 19 terrorists in 9/11? #Iran did https://t.co/PM3hKETBlE
@AhmadAlgohbary I agree, some media ignored the crisis in #Yemen to cover up Houthis’ roles there in blocking humanitarian aids and killing aids workers and innocents.
@CAATuk investigate itself!! who told you it committed war crimes in #Yemen? all great powers admitted the Saudi’s efforts to establish peace there.
@rulajebreal modernize the country doesn’t mean stop killing terrorists and killers!!
@RichardDawkins why? for doing what’s best for the world!! for eliminating terrorists?
@BrookingsInst terrorists want revenge!! their leader is responsible for many deaths of children and women in #Yemen. 	he’s also responsible for what happened to Yemen after he allies with #Iran.
@LeandraCme @snarwani “He’s your award” 🤔	there’s huge difference between “here’s” &amp; “he’s”, I can teach you the basics if you want 😙.
@LeandraCme @snarwani I win. ✌🏼😝
#IranDeal allowed the regime to gain money and powers that used for starting wars and proxies, funding terrorism and terrorists groups, supporting terrorists operations all over the region.
@LeandraCme @snarwani Iran is not interfering in Morocco’s affairs? the brutal regime is not interfering? you mean the biggest state of supporting terrorism is not interfering there??
@PressTV no sudanese officials confirm your claim!! which means it’s a fake one.
@Fat_hiSaid @PressTV is that how Houthis threaten peaceful Yemenis?
@AJEnglish #Saudi Arabia is standing with people of Palestinian, unlike #Qatar who supports Hamas, the terrorist group.
@snarwani does Morocco say it took orders from Saudi Arabia?
@snarwani so you want Morocco praises #Iran’s interfering in its internal affairs and welcomes it?
@foxandfriends @netanyahu Iranian regime have to stop its aggressive policies and cut its fundings for terrorism.
@foxandfriends @netanyahu he’s totally right, #Iran regime’s spreading destruction and chaos all over the region and Trump administration didn’t respond to its actions until this moment!!
@BenjaminNorton @AhmadAlgohbary Houthis won’t bomb one of their soldiers’ wedding. 	or maybe they’d do it to blame saudis as usual.
@PressTV Iranians were beaten up by saudis 😂
@PressTV the world is willing to take down your regime and free the innocents Iranians who were tortured to live under your brutal regime.
@jricole when did he say that?
@DrAlakbarov some MPs came weeks ago to Saudi Arabia and witnessed the aggression that Houthis did to Yemenis. 		don’t blame UK or others for things they didn’t do.
@DrAlakbarov there’s no evidence until this moment that #SaudiArabia is targeting civilians in #Yemen 		it’s all rumors made by Houthis.
@CassandraRules are you preferring to have #Iran as an ally? or maybe #Hezbollah !!
@AJENews really? so now Americans are the one who destabilizing the region and making wars? and your regime is innocent?
@OrwellNGoode Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the one who’s protecting US &amp; UK interests in Middle East, both governments are respecting his efforts to establish peace there.
@jjz1600 #Hamas group ruined all political solutions to end the conflict, with help from #Iran of course.
@markcurtis30 complicated in a war crimes against terrorists, and I mean Houthis &amp; Iranian agents? yeah I’d cheer for them.
@tparsi #Saudi Arabia will always stay beside their Palestinians brothers and support their case to restore their land.
@marwanbishara you must know that these kind of reports are fake especially if there’s no confirmation form Saudi officials.
@AhmadAlgohbary are their any Houthis killed in that air strikes?
@AmirAminiMD you based your analysis on insured report, intelligent 👌🏼		weeks ago, #Saudis announced they’re still supporting the Palestinians against #Israel &amp; Trump’s decision to move the embassy.
@miss9afi your husband insulted #Islam, plus he impose his opinions on people and asked them to turn against the government and its laws.
@MGee8600 @khamenei_ir no one because there’s NONE.
@BarakRavid @axios @news10 he didn’t say it publicly, which means it’s a fake report as most of the time.
@khamenei_ir wherever your regime entered, it created instability and chaos, it also brought misery and sadness to people, that’s why US &amp; #SaudiArabia will end your regime’s present in region forever.
@khamenei_ir seriously??	so you’re saying your regime did nothing wrong in region??		US is the power that will end your brutal regime.
@khamenei_ir when will your regime stop its interfering in #Yemen, #Lebanon, and #Iraq? 		let the world lives in peace without your aggressive policies in Middle East.
@khamenei_ir your regime’s goal is to make Muslims fight each other, to destabilize the whole region, to spread chaos everywhere.
@Bahebbaq @SallahAmadou @PressTV you said it, it was fragments not a direct missile.
@KenRoth you can blame Houthis &amp; Iranians for that, they started a civil war against Yemeni legitimate government.
@PeterTatchell are you repeating your old tweet?
@Independent a move that will cost the region a lot if Iranian regime used that for its interest.
@nytimesworld next time publish real statement. 		Pompeo didn’t say anything about #Qatar crisis and sided with #Saudi about #Yemen
@tedlieu my dear Ted Lieu, #Saudi Crown Prince did not say that fake claim, so please make sure of what you say before publish it.
@AJENews I don’t think #German will take this choice because it’ll allow Iranian regime to continue its policies in Middle East.
@AJENews all thanks to #Iran who made Houthis coup against their country and launching a war against their legitimate government.
@SallahAmadou @PressTV Houthis can’t even know how to use them!! I guess they blowed up themselves several times.
@PressTV those are Iranian missiles launched to target #Saudi Arabia!!	I guess that called ‘starting a war”!!
@Chellaney after hearing Pompeo’s statement in #Riyadh, are you still thinking he delivered a tough message to #Saudis? 😂
@DailySabah did he really say that? I mean the thing about #Qatar?		no peace will be achieved with Qatar as long as it supports terrorists groups.
@dadmehr_d @DailySabah yeah gulf countries, there’s no such thing called Persian there.
@ibrahim_moh9900 @weinbergersa when did USA admitted that it’s launching a war against #Yemen??		it did say it’ll counter the Iranian regime exists in region.
@KenRoth reforming means to end corruption and funding for terrorism. 		#SaudiArabia is heading to new era where justice is one of the proprieties.
@AJENews funny guys, enjoy the rumors 😂.
@KenRoth when did he say that? I didn’t hear it when he told his statement to press. 		you’re repeating unknown report that was published in @nytimes.
RT @StateDept: Secretary Pompeo: Saudi Arabia's security is a priority for the United States. We'll continue to work closely with our Saudi…
RT @StateDept: Secretary Pompeo: Muslim majority countries must take the lead in combatting terrorism and radicalization around the world..…
@yarotrof no proves that Pompeo said that, it came out from unknown source and he didn’t mention that in his statement in front of the media.
@PressTV does #Iran have women-only gyms?
@Cirincione is there any prove that whatever targeted the wedding was by US missiles? 	of course not because the case is  still under investigation.
@LotteLeicht1 #Iran is beheading a lot more and no one is mentioning that!!
@DailySabah you’re really focusing on #Saudi women’ news! just like Qatari media 😏🤔		what about trying to cover the situation in #Iran?
@DrZuhdiJasser @loladeantonia26 there’s no such thing called Wahhabism, it’s something #Iran create to blame someone for its actions in Middle East.
@DrZuhdiJasser keep your sarcasm for yourself please!		we don’t really know if those 48 were terrorists or not, plus we don’t even know it the report was fake or not!!
@ibrahim_moh9900 @weinbergersa don’t blame USA for your actions that caused Yemenis a lot of suffering and misery.
and Houthis are a toy used by #Iran 😏 https://t.co/nmAWDdQ4kK
@weinbergersa both of #UAE and #Saudi Arabia are having a great relationship and acting together for their joint interests. 	it doesn’t matter who assassinate that terrorist as long they’re working together 👍🏼
@IntheNow_tweet it’s his thoughts, you don’t need to agree with everything he says!!		are you upset because #Iran will lose its proxy if US keeps its support for #Saudi-led coalition?
@nntaleb it’s his opinion, you may disagree with him but you should respect his point of view. 		for me, I’d say stopping arms sells would allow Iranian regime to extend its present in #Yemen.
@BaFana3 @POTUS @Raytheon you claims based on local media? 😂	seriously!!		do you think Houthis will condemn themselves? he’ll no they won’t.
@NRC_Egeland we can do something, like calling to stop aids blocking by Houthis, providing weapons by #Iran.
@aliShihabi it doesn’t matter, they’re working together. 		they succeeded in eliminating one of their terrorism’s wanted list. 👍🏽
@miss9afi #Saudi is changing, but not ignoring its principles.
@AhmadAlgohbary you’re wasting your time because you’re on the wrong side!!	don’t ally with Houthis, the terrorists, and look at the big picture.
@piersmorgan still upset because you didn’t interview #Saudi Crown Prince? 😂	just move on lol 😆
@Dr_Ulrichsen #Saudi Arabia &amp; #UAE are working as one unity, #MikePompeo ’s trip to Middle East and not visiting UAE doesn’t mean he won’t go there later.
@AJEnglish there’s no way you guys can compare between #Saudi Arabia and the Iranian regime who’s making proxies all over the region.
@stranahan no #Saudi official sources confirmed that claim!!		@hrw has many activists who’re against #Saudi Arabia, so these kind of claims aren’t surprising.
@lloyd_rm @LRB Iran is giving Houthis deadly weapons, no condemnation yet!!
@snarwani so killing terrorists is radicalism!!	is that your point of view?
@BenjaminNorton the claimed incident is still under investigation, wait till the truth comes to light. 		if it wasn’t fake report, I’m sure Houthis targeted it.
@AJEnglish is that your way to confess the world that #Iranian regime is strong? 😂		we all know that #Iran can’t win a direct war  if happened.
@hdagres #Saudi Arabia don’t mind to cooperate with #Iran if it stops its aggressive policies in region and cut its support of terrorism.
@PeterTatchell @Obey___ simply because they didn’t do war crimes in #Yemen, but Houthis &amp; #Iran did.
@theIRC @DMiliband and who blocked the aids to reach Yemenis?? Houthis. 		UN must do something before we lose the civilians there.
@tedlieu if you really depend on those sources as you said, then you should condemn Iranian regime’s roles in Yemen. 		the regime has killed thousands of innocents there without and condemnation from you, senator!!
@KenRoth Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to change #Saudi Arabia, but anyone insults Islam and challenges the laws will get punished.
@KenRoth correction:	he called #Saudi king Salman, not the Crown Prince!		don’t misleading your followers next time.
@RT_com are you kidding?	you can’t fool anyone with that lie!!		#Iran, your regime, aims to control the region with your aggressive policies.
@DrJillStein FYI, the ones who reported the attack are Houthis, got it?	they targeted the wedding party to blame #SaudiArabia and get the international community’s attention.
@tedlieu wait a sec, your source is Qatari one!!	they’re allying with Iranian regime who’s fighting Yemeni legitimate government and #SaudiArabia in #Yemen
@mehdirhasan @theintercept war criminals are #Iran &amp; their ally Houthis, alongside Assad’s regime.
@CarolineLucas but there’s no proof till this moment that #SaudiArabia targeted the wedding party!!	keep in mind maybe Houthis did that.
@CarolineLucas The crisis caused by Iranian regime &amp; Houthis, so it’s normal to aids the #Saudis to restore peace there in #Yemen
@AndrewBlackmer @hennyh53 @AhmadAlgohbary they’re killing innocents children and women, do you want us to support them!!!
@hennyh53 @AhmadAlgohbary it’s clear, iran provided missiles to militants in Yemen to target innocents and blame someone else. that regime aims to destabilize the whole region in order to control it.
@AhmadAlgohbary you’re trying to manipulate the people with your claims but guess what, no one will listen because they know the truth.
@AhmadAlgohbary Houthis won’t bomb a wedding belongs to one of their supporters. 	simple fact!!
@AJEnglish who blockade what???	no way you guys can confess the people about your lies and claims. 	Houthis are the ones who blocked all aids and every means to help Yemenis.
@business because it’s a new step for #Saudis, especially for those who’s never watched a move in cinema, yes they would pay that price.
@PressTV wow? when? in Houthis’ fantasy?		they can’t even aim at one target correctly 😂
@WWE @WWENetwork new journey for #WWEStars to be in a new place like #SaudiArabia.	hope they &amp; audiences have fun.
@BenjaminNorton @nikkihaley @USUN wow!! so you’re defending the Iranian regime at the expense of innocents in #Yemen!!! 	shame on you.
RT @nikkihaley: RT @USUN : “To achieve peace in Yemen, Iran must stop its interference and its violations of the arms embargo.” https://t.c…
that’s right, no peace will be achieved until #Iran stops its aggression. https://t.co/H8WwveDMk0
@nikkihaley @USUN if the regime didn’t stop its policies? what’ll be next? launching a war against #Iran?		I hope yes.
@GeorgeMonbiot civilians who’re stucked in civil wars are the real victims. 	which hurts me is seeing the Iranian regime continue its aggressive policies in region by arming the Houthis who keep killing the innocents there.
@PressTV killing a terrorist who ordered to kill innocents is must. 	#Iran should stop providing weapons to Houthis in order to end the civil war immediately.
@innercitypress @Shuaibalmosawa @farissaeedtaiz @teddy_cat1 @SaadAbedine he should condemn Houthis’ Attack on that wedding which costed innocents lives.
@RichardWellings but there’s no mention of Houthis’ attacks on civilians there in #Yemen!!	that’s weird, don’t you agree?
@RichardWellings there’s a possible chance that Houthis were behind the attack on that wedding party.
they’re reporting from @AJEnglish 😂 told you weak source of information. https://t.co/XOnffzIv83
@Liam_O_Hare will you condemn the Iranian regime who killed innocents in #Yemen?
@Liam_O_Hare you trust one of @AJEnglish reporters, which is the wrong move you made. 		those reporters are only seeking for misleading the audiences by their agendas.
@ZaidZamanHamid you’ll see them on Wednesday and then it’ll be too late to recognize that your claims were based on weak sources, the qatari ones.
@Ndawsari you mean son of Houthis’ leader?	so no plans to withdrawal their forces and leave #Yemen to its people!!	too bad 💔
@Ndawsari it’ll have a big impact on Houthis especially his death will led to eliminate all militants in near future.
@AliAlAhmed_en @AlArabiya_Eng @UN @UN_DPA he’s a terrorist, who managed some terrorist operations. 	plus, the legitimate government praised the attack that killed him as one more step to defeat terrorism in #Yemen
@AliAlAhmed_en @BBCWorld @UKinSaudiArabia @FCOArabic @FCOHumanRights this’s how it happened: find a place to bomb and get the world’s attention, then bomb it and take pictures of victims, after that tell pro- Iran press that #Saudis are behind the attack. 		Houthis are pathetic to use innocents for their goals.
@ggreenwald it’s so funny that everything Houthis do in #Yemen become #Saudis’ act 😂	is that Houthis’ way to get some attention from international community!!		it’s useless as long #Iranian regime helping them.
@MaxAbrahms #Iran is making the situations there in #Syria &amp; #Yemen much worse than ever. 	it supports terrorists militants and funds them by money and weapons.
@OwenJones84 there’s no proof till this moment that it was destroyed by #Saudis, it may be by Houthis to blame #Saudi as always.
@Harryslaststand do you think UK government will believe any report that come from nowhere!!	trust me if all governments do act based on fake reports then wars won’t end.
@MaxAbrahms “health officials said” 🤔	who’re those!! there’s no names which make this report suspicious!!
@BrentToderian @RiyadhTransport @ArRiyadh_ADA @humantransit @grescoe @MassTransitmag @sustrans @SPUR_Urbanist @Richard_Florida this’s how to develop you country and give the people everything they may need, not like in #Iran where the regime shuts down all applications and prevent its people to communicate with outside. https://t.co/VRuxzwKouS
@AlexEmmons do you want them to admit fake facts? is that your way to support those pathetic reports made by pro #Iran!
@AlexEmmons wrong!	US is trying to protect its interests in #Yemen and counter the Iranian present there.
@NRC_Egeland I don’t know why Iranian missiles were targeting innocents on wedding party!! 	shame on Houthis and their ally.
@OxfamYemen it seems Houthis don’t want a political solution as they got orders from #Iran to kill anyone tries to help civilians.
@IraqiSecurity looks like you cannot report one correct claim. 	how taking down a toy drone becomes a terrorist attack 😂.
@JSchanzer you know why?	because Iranian agents are among those activities, they can’t condemn a regime that pay their salaries.
RT @JSchanzer: Also, I’m curious why we don’t see a broad condemnation of Iran’s proxy war in Yemen from these groups. The evidence of Iran…
@JSchanzer you’re right, Iranian regime should stop its proxies over the region
@_malbayati @evilepicface1 @ZaidZamanHamid I don’t see them! all I see is true leaders who care about their citizens and other people.
@rulajebreal anyone can see the real picture here by knowing the source who tell the story, Qataris are faking facts just to claim that saudis are against the government 😂		are #Iran @ #Qatar so desperate to create this show 😂🤔
@Cairo67Unedited since when Qataris have become a trusted source 😂		Check the media &amp; press again.
@_malbayati @evilepicface1 @ZaidZamanHamid are you saying in next years terrorists will protect the two holy mosques? 😂		what about to letting them control the world.
@danishevskiy31 @ZaidZamanHamid Coup 😂😂 	you’re so funny 😆 		tell me what happened with that coup you’ said about? I’m interested.
@ZaidZamanHamid no one can ever dare to attack #KingSalman or his Crown Prince #Mohammad bin Salman. 	#SaudiArabia is safe &amp; secure country, unlike that regime &gt; 🇮🇷
@FullSteam15 @UrDSU @IraqiSecurity very fake one 😏.
@IraqiSecurity your source is weak, make sure next time to bring a good source 😝.
@AliAlAhmed_en @USAinKSA it’s a no fly-zone, so obviously security forces will take down anything suspicious.
@AliAlAhmed_en @GhanemAlmasarir @KingSalman @ForeignAffairs your sources are enough to tell it’s a lie 😂😂😂. 	try harder my friend.
@BenjaminNorton anyone can write a fake report and says: “according to residents”. 	this’s not professional.
@markcurtis30 even in #Yemen, UK should sanction the Iranian regime for helping Houthis there.
@Francescorocca @ICRC_ye do you think Houthis militants will understand what does “humanitarians are #NotaTarget” mean?	I guess the answer is no.
@WHOYemen #Yemen suffered too much, we shouldn’t allow it to fall in hands of Iranian regime or Houthis.
@StylianidesEU @ICRC shame on Houthis 💔. 	is that the way how to treat people who helping innocents!!
@PressTVPrograms Houthis are the one who don’t want political solution 😏.
@riskparty63 I hope you enjoy your staying there and see the new #Saudi Arabia where all people can live together peacefully.
@ericgkelsey @stephenkalin @SarahDadouch there’re no ban on movies in #SaudiArabia , only cinemas.
@ICRC Gulf countries are helping Yemenis but all aids were blocked by Houthis and Iranian agents!!
@MikeGapes @bbcquestiontime it’s all war crimes caused by Syrian &amp; Iranian regimes. 	international community must act against them as as soon as possible.
@MikeGapes so you’re saying that #Russia and #Iranian regime are making the situation in both #Syria &amp; #Yemen much worse!!
@MikeGapes I agree with you, but look at the common force there, it is the Iranian regime!!
@AliAbunimah is there any UAE official announced it’ll participate with Israel Air Force? or is it another fake report?
@StateDept @UN @USEmbassyYemen @USUN I hope they discussed the Iranian role in blocking aids and causing the humanitarian crisis.
@BaFana3 weak source!! 	is that kind of your sources which you come up everyday?
@mhdksafa me too, Syrian &amp; Iranian regime’s made the worse crisis in the world in both #Syria &amp; #Yemen
@RawyaRageh so Houthis torture, kill, and kidnap Yemenis! and with Iranian help!	this civil conflict went beyond humanity.
@AhmadAlgohbary @jeremycorbyn @tedlieu you’re happy because they didn’t mention the support of Iranian regime. 	you know what, it doesn’t matter what they’re saying, Trump administration knows the whole situation in #Yemen, that’s why it supports #Saudus.
@DailySabah you’re repeating their news 😂 &gt;&gt; @PressTV 	try to find a good fake one next time.
@SamWalton there’s no proof that UK’s forces caused that destruction!!	sometimes we should think it MAY BE caused by Iranian missiles 😏.
@RoKhanna do you have anything to say about #Iran negative roles in Middle East which caused civil conflicts, wars, migration and tragedies!!
@RepRoKhanna the only common enemy in the two crisis is #Iran. 	Iranian regime is supporting both Syrian regime &amp; Houthis to attack and kill their own people!!!	US administration must stop that regime’s aggressive policies in region.
@SenToddYoung @ForeignPolicy we can alleviate #Yemen crisis by cut the Iranian regime aids to Houthis.	#Iran has been the biggest supporter of the civil war there.
@RandPaul you need to mention #Iran’s policies in #Yemen too.
@DanCardenMP while you supporting one of the Iranian agents, go to #SaudiArabia and by yourself the lies behind what’s happening in #Yemen. 	#Iran-backed Houthis are attacking innocents children &amp; women and blaming the #Saudi-led coalition.
@PeterStefanovi2 @jeremycorbyn @theresa_may but saudis tried to help yemenis unlike Iran-backed Houthis. 	@jeremycorbyn is a friend of #Iran’s regime so he’ll fight to ensure that his terrorists allies will be safe from any strikes.
@Harryslaststand Iranian regime is supporting the civil war there by giving weapons and money to Houthis who’re torturing &amp; killing the innocents people in #Yemen
@Harryslaststand do you really know what’s happening in #Yemen? 	do you know who’re the conflict’s parties?	I’m sure you’re a wise man so be sure to know what’s happening there before you judge.
@AhmadAlgohbary is that the Houthis’ daily report? 😂	I advise you not to misleading whoever read your tweets.
@mattzarb @jeremycorbyn is an Iranian agent, so no surprising he went against the air strikes on Syrian regime and asks for bombing #Saudi Arabia
@AhmadAlgohbary @realDonaldTrump @theresa_may @EmmanuelMacron why you satisfied with #iran intervening in#Yemen?	why Houthis are killing Yemenis by orders from Iranian regime?	why you defend the aggressive role of Iran in region?
@USUN the American administration knows how dangerous is #Iran but when it’ll act against the regime?
the question is, who’s gonna stop #Iran? https://t.co/Elj9FQ2Aeq
@SenToddYoung your ambassador said #Iran is the one who destabilize the region by its aggressive policies and missiles which were given to Houthis. https://t.co/IDRrjNnxJK
@SenToddYoung @SenatorShaheen @SenatorCollins @ChrisCoons did you senators consider the Iranian regime’s role in #Yemen where it pushes the civil war forward and uses the Houthis to attack #SaudiArabia.
@tcwittes Arabs are united, and latest summit that took place days ago in #Saudi Arabia proved that. 	#Egypt won’t take backward steps for stability in region as #Qatar did.
@LauraLoomer @POTUS has advisers for a reason, to think with him about future moves. 	we don’t have to agree with him 100%, but for sure he’ll do his best for his great country.
@LauraLoomer this’s the problem with #FakeNews that media spreads. 	no one said #Iran is the one to blame for 9/11 attack, which’s true based on its terrorist operations that it funded.
@Cernovich wow, I guess this’s the most stupidest analysis I’ve ever read. 		you didn’t mention #Iran’s aggressive role in #Yemen, does that make you a supporter for Iranian regime!!!!??????
@Osman_Marwa1 it’s so funny when you tries to manipulate facts and use that for your own agendas.
@illmatador @Hussam_h70 @Cernovich that case are based on lies, not evidences.
@Cernovich you’re telling fake facts!!	terrorists groups were Iranian agents who supported regimes like Syrian &amp; Iranian. 	#Saudis have nothing to do with 9/11, #Iran has. 	#US present in Middle East is must.
@KyleWOrton he’s repeating his Iranian ally speech!!	we all know that #Iran is the one who funded terrorists organizations, not #SaudiArabia
@ChrisHazzardSF do not mix all conflicts in Middle East, each country has the right to defend itself from terrorists groups like #Hamas in Palestinian or Iran-backed Houthis in #Yemen.
@DonteStallworth you never mentioned Iranian regime’s role in #Yemen, I’m wondering why!!		are you telling me that #Iran has nothing to do with civil war in there!??
#Yemen was being destroyed when #Iran entered it and helped Houthis to take over the country +3 years ago. 	US alongside with #Saudi Arabia are trying to protect the innocents there. https://t.co/ThZOcRwsuR
@PrisonPlanet won’t happen at all 😌. 	#Saudi Arabia will remain the strongest ally in Middle East for western countries.
@AhmadAlgohbary this’s the misleading information!!	even poor children used for their dirty propaganda. 	pro-Iran agents are in everywhere in #Yemen 💔
@MaxAbrahms In #Syria, Assad’s regime used chemical weapons against its own people. 	In #Yemen, #Iran is attacking Yemenis by supporting Houthis to do that. 		two faces for one coin.
@dancohen3000 @secupp any place #Iran involved in will be a disaster. 		if Iranian regime enters #America for example, trust me it’ll never see the sun again.
@Cernovich saying facts has nothing to do with money!!	previous US administration told media that #Saudis didn’t plan 9/11 attack.
@Cernovich BTW, there’s no evidence that #Saudis were behind 9/11 attack, evidences showed the terrorists were in #Iran where they got trained &amp; funded.
@Cernovich people support #Saudi Arabia because it suffered a lot from terrorism, and they appreciate its positive role to fight terrorism and cut its fundings.
@AliAlAhmed_en @Tobias_Ellwood then international community must act ASAP against Houthis and Iranian regime who starvation #Yemen &amp; killed thousands of innocents.

@mitchellvii I understand that #Iran is the common enemy there.
@Dalatrm @FarsNews_Agency they’re fake news, they’re spreading lies S usual. 	Iranian regime’s media can’t be so honest with audiences.
@khamenei_ir targeting military bases that used to launch the latest chemical attack IS NOT a war #crime. 	responding to the latest #chemical attack who killed innocents IS NOT a war crime. 		protecting the regime who killed its own people IS a war crime.
@khamenei_ir international community defeated #ISIS in #Syria &amp; #Iraq. 	your regime was trying to get there in order to save them for eliminated.
@khamenei_ir what a lie, all terrorist groups were raised in #Iran where they got trained &amp; funded. 		your regime is the one responsible for all wars in region.
@Elizrael @MStephensGulf Pathetic move 😂. 	#Qatar is trying to focus on others’ affairs instead of its internal problems.
@DrAlakbarov then tell #Iran to stop sending its missiles and targeting innocents in #Yemen.
@ChrisMurphyCT Saudi- led coalition never used chemical weapons in fighting Houthis unlike Syrian regime. 	you can’t compare between the two wars because Assad is killing his people on purpose while #saudis are protecting Yemenis from Houthis attacks.
@PrisonPlanet what do you think of Iran’s present in #Yemen and #syria? 	the regime has helped to keep the civil war in both countries continue which cost lives there.
@markcurtis30 all nations care about safety of people, not only in #Syria or #Yemen, but what’s fake is focusing on #Saudi Arabia’s attempts to protect itself instead of #Iran’s role in Yemen.
@markcurtis30 #UK is against the Houthis’ coup, so it’s normal to condemn their aggressive in region not only in #Saudi Arabia.
@SamWalton that’s your opinion, but reality says #Iran is behind the destabilizing in those countries you mentioned. 	Iranian regime funded terrorist groups in region, and supported their operations.

@AhmadAlgohbary saloon at the picture from another aspect, #Iran is helping the Syrian regime, supporting #Hezbollah, giving missiles to Houthis to keep on the civil war. 		I guess the Iranian regime is the one who’s aiming to drive the region into chaos.
@markcurtis30 it’d be better if #Iran stops its support for Houthis and let the country for its people.

@RepRoKhanna innocent civilians were attacked by Iranian missiles, not Americans ones. 	you should encourage other senators to condemn the Iranian regime’s actions.
@Pax_UK @17_londers1978 @SamWalton and you seems to be the shield of pro-regime states like Iran 😏.
@Pax_UK @17_londers1978 @SamWalton okey then instead of focusing on fake reports about Saudi Arabia, go and condemn #Iran’s and its allies’ there who tortured and killed civilians in purpose.
@AJEnglish Qatar is a close friend of #Iran, which is a close friend of Houthis. 		the math is simple.
partnership between the two great nations will make the world more safer. https://t.co/UwS8xS10q9
RT @AlArabiya_Eng: Speaking from Washington DC, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir: We are cooperating with the #US in containing #Iran.…
@SamWalton @STWuk @CNDuk you never mentioned #Iran’s missiles that targeted innocents in #Yemen and destroyed their hospitals, schools and even public sites.
@Pax_UK @17_londers1978 @SamWalton should I remind you when #Russia protected the Iranian regime by using the veto against a resolution at UN which would condemn its aggressive role in #Yemen!!
@SamWalton + it’s the most capable country that can take #Iran down if the Iranian regime made stupid move toward Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦.
@SamWalton we all knows that U.S. &amp; UK are making arms deals with #SaudiArabia just because it’s their strongest ally in Middle East.
@BenjaminNorton @SenatorMenendez @SenBillNelson you’re upset because those senators didn’t help to stop the air strikes that target your friends, the Houthis.
@SenFeinstein do you really know why is #Saudi Arabia fighting there? and for whom?		FYI, Houthis have taken over the country three years ago and tortured &amp; killed anyone who doesn’t acknowledge them as the rulers. 	#SaudiArabia is helping the legitimate government to retake the country.
@AhmadAlgohbary aren’t those photos of victims of Houthis’ attacks! 	I guess they’re.
@AhmadAlgohbary U.S. administration is full aware of all #Saudi-led coalition’s operations and as long it didn’t mention this incident then it means it didn’t happen at all or it was done by Houthis.
