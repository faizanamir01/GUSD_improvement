📣Everyone who wants to buy a gun should be properly vetted first!📣		If you agree, text SENATE to 954-954. We'll connect you to your senator's office so you can tell them to vote YES on SB. 42, the Background Checks Expansion Act. #ChecksOverChecks https://t.co/KPYc4DSH7U

BREAKING: The House just passed #HR1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act, to close the Charleston Loophole.		Since 1998, the loophole has put over 60,000 guns in the hands of prohibited gun owners.		We must now call on the Senate to pass this life saving legislation.
During the #RoadToChange Tour, we discussed the Charleston Loophole with survivors from The Emanuel AME Shooting.		Today, we have an opportunity to remove this arbitrary wait time from the Background Check System.		Ring Your Rep @ (202) 224-3121 &amp; tell them to vote yes on #HR1112 https://t.co/BehVsoOEAt
Here's the deal:	1. The background checks bill passed the House yesterday.	2. Now it's headed to the senate.	3. We need EVERYONE to call their senator to get this bill passed.		Text SENATE to 954-954—we'll connect you to your senator so you can demand they vote YES on SB.42. https://t.co/jOAcE0wQdt
Today, the House voted on H.R.8, AKA the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, and it PASSED! 		One of the first pieces of gun violence prevention legislation in a decade cleared the first hurdle toward becoming a law. #ChecksOverChecks https://t.co/CzhUIKYyDE

After going dark to honor those lost in Parkland 1 year ago, we sadly turn our attention to Aurora, IL.		While our community healed, another was torn apart.		Even as strides are made to prevent gun violence, the cycle continues.		These Angels will receive justice. #AuroraStrong
Thank you for joining this fight alongside us this past year. Together, we will make sure no other community or family goes through what we went through last February.
We will be going dark for four days from February 14th through the 17th. During that time, if past trends continue, around 400 people in the U.S. will likely be shot to death.
On February 14th, 2018 the Parkland community lost 17 lives in a tragic and preventable act of gun violence. Everything we have done and everything we will do is for them. #MSDStrong https://t.co/pnaOwTSD2c
