The FBI defines a mass shooting as 4 people killed (not including the shooter). Mass shootings occur in churches, in schools, at concerts, in waffle houses - just about anywhere. Except in other countries. https://t.co/gf8k8UAy1k
(4/4) Removing the assault and semi-automatic weapons from our Civilian society, instituting thorough background checks and mandatory waiting periods (and raising the buying age and banning the production of high-capacity magazines) are the ways to stop shootings in America.
(3/4) The local police say a man at the scene wrestled his gun away - looks like you don’t need to arm a teacher (or a resource officer) to stop a shooting. There goes the sales pitch for @SmithWessonCorp 🤷‍♀️
(2/4) they happen everywhere in America, and now one has happened in Waffle House. You can donate all the shooting shelters to schools that you want, but at the end of the day, we can’t build our world out of Kevlar - someone is making Mad Money off that.
(1/4) He was white and he used an AR-15. The @NRA is about to say this man had mental health issues, so that the rest of us will get scared of anyone with poor mental health and buy a gun in preemptive defense so that gun sales increase. Shootings don’t just happen in schools, https://t.co/FIzyTCvuA1
