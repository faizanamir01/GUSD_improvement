Why because there ilegal immigrants? @ACLU Trump calls this MAGA. Great job! @nytimes https://t.co/gHPICKHKv5
@ACLU Yet the Trump Administration is only interested in Venezuela for their oil calling it humanitarian help when we have people dying in our governt custody in ICE facilities. Anything wrong here? Is this what MAGA is all about? Absolutely disgusting!
@NYDailyNews An 11 year old child held accountable for a minor death? What the fuck is wrong with our American Justice System? The parents should be in federal prison. Why did the parent leave a minor to care for a baby when both children require adult supervision? Shameful court case.
@PietroMartnez @NoticentroWAPA @Jenniffer2012 Exactly!!
@NoticentroWAPA @Jenniffer2012 Let’s be clear about this people. It’s a speech given in Washington. Everyone can dance and clap away but the reality is that if you don’t live in PR you don’t vote on this decision nor will you contribute in making PR a state.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How much did Trump JR utilize from your charity fund to pay Fox News for this useless interview on TV?
@juandalmauPR Is nice to dream!
@TheJusticeDept does this seem correct? This case requires more attention in holding the parents accountable. Not a 11 year old child. @nytimes @dcexaminer @NYPDnews https://t.co/wwOr761aRt
@thehill That’s definitely Trump! He doesn’t respect @SpeakerPelosi because he can’t pay her off like he has done throughout the years with others.
@ChuckCallesto At the end of all these continuous Trump allegations of women, tax evasions, &amp; federal governt violations, he won’t be held accountable &amp; he will end up winning a second term. The rich and powerful always prevails. That’s MAGA! 👌🏻

@RonWyden @SenBooker Get ready to create thousands of back logs throughout the court system in the U.S		Start opening prison doors for offenders to start walking out.
@Public_Citizen Trump throughout years has cheated the system in taxes. It’s one reason why he had conflicts with the IRS in the past. The only difference is that he can’t use his charity money to pay anything off again.
@YanieYampier People can’t handle criticism nor others opinion without getting offended. Without others opinion or criticism we can’t evolve in becoming better at what we do everyday.
@TheDC_Opinion @DailyCaller @VicToensing Trump holds no saying when sanctioning other countries. He was given clases during the UN about that. He needs to remember that.

@ACLU Trump has committed many illegal activities before office. Yet nothing is done about it regardless of the severity of his actions. Why expect anything different now? The governt will not do anything! Waste of time.

@krassenstein These are acts of cruelty by the Trump Administration. Many of Trumps appointees are aware of these acts and many refuse to say or expose the truth of the facilities. This is one of many steps that Trump thinks it will MAGA. Absolutely disgusting.
@NoticentroWAPA the @DSPnoticias &amp; @DCR_PR do not hold accountable violent offenders. Criminals kill officers, woman, &amp; children at their liking but the @Justicia_PR is scared to give violent criminals the death penalty bqz it’s cruelty. But criminals killing innocent citizens isn’t cruelty.
@Jenniffer2012 Esos crimínales merecen la pena de muerte! ustedes no tienen ningún control en combatir la criminalidad. Tienen estos criminales con bandejas de oro en la carcel con lujos y sin consecuencias. Por eso es que están acabando con la gente trabajadora en PR.
@nievesm711 @ricardorossello Y la tristeza de todo es que el mismo gobierno tiene estos criminales en un ambiente lleno de lujos en la prision que no representa ningún tipo de castigo. Los tienen con más derechos que la sociedad y mas que los empleados de corrección. Por eso es que matan como locos.
@ricardorossello A great concern to our law enforcement community in PR. If the @Justicia_PR allows these criminals to kill a PR police officer without hard punishment, then our system is lost. Pesquera soft hand slap tactics to violent criminals truly displays who runs &amp; controls the island.

@nutcrake @RepStephMurphy @ricardorossello Nine years living in the island and I’ve seen enough to know the continuous political abuse &amp; lies. mismanagement of US dollars, contributing citizens loosing pensions &amp; retirement benefits, while criminals in prison vote for PR political parties.

@RepStephMurphy @ricardorossello How does a violent criminal who murders an innocent citizen gets the right to vote? Understandable if he is return to society but while serving a life sentence they hold the same right as a tax payer to vote? Contributing working citizens hold those rights. Not criminals in jail.

One that yet many US governt employees can’t swallow is with violent criminals in prison vote into office PR political groups in exchange for prison privileges.

@gustavovelezpr @sierradedorado7 @cate_long @carlosjrom The 2012 Census with over 2 million citizens in PR living of a temporary assistance program for generations at a cost of billions yearly while the @SenadoPR, @CamaraConPR, as allowed this to continue. How is this going to pay the debt @FOMBPR? How is this helping the economy?
@gustavovelezpr @cate_long It’s interesting how many claim such roles in economics, &amp; financial experience &amp; yet no one can create a system to restore the islands economy. But they love US tax payers dollars &amp; only contributing citizens pay the price for the incompetence of PR politicians mismanagement.
@jefonseca04 @VoceroPR @ricardorossello Deberían despedir todos los idiotas que estuvieron en el proceso de arresto y al los del tribunal por idiotas. Eso fue para que lo pongan en un programa de asistencia para el y no ir preso. Que vergüenza ser gobernador y tener gente así en un sistema de justicia tan perdido.
@VoceroPR That tells you the incompetence of the  Injustices in Puerto Rico. He stole $11 dollars and within the process how much did the courts spend in thousands of dollars? Very phenomenal work! 🎊🎉👏👏

@GarciaManny4 @sierradedorado7 @Hjtorrespr @trudythought @SolusLupusNews It’s won’t happen. If you recall in 2012 the US federal government was going to initiate an internal investigation in a wide area of political appointees in PR and for some apparent magical reason it was refrain from being executed at the last minute. Dirty closets don’t last.
@GarciaManny4 @sierradedorado7 @Hjtorrespr @trudythought @SolusLupusNews The sad part is that many are identified and yet, nothing is done to get them out.
@PRPDNoticias To join the police department of PR with the type of inconsistency it’s absolute stupidity. They have to purchase their own uniforms, equipment, gas up &amp; fix their government cars at their expense. The retirement and pensions are extremely abusive. They deserve better!
@PRFAA @ricardorossello the PR government asking for 600 million for none contributing people living off a temporary assistance program for generations &amp; yet you call it a success? You tax up the small percentage of contributing citizens, attack pensions, retirement benefits &amp; that’s fairness?

@CarmenYulinCruz @SJUCiudadPatria @nytimes @FederalTimes @washingtonpost it’s absolutely ridiculous &amp; embarrassing how @CarmenYulinCruz manipulates the media.

@JohnnyMndez36 @ricardorossello @CamaraConPR @fortalezapr Another useless trip at the hands of US tax payers dollars.
@CarmenYulinCruz @ABC @CarmenYulinCruz shameful is when voted elected officials target communities &amp; shut down schools in PR to save millions in fed funds and force families to leave our island in seek of a better environment for their children’s education. That’s shameful!

@TelenoticiasPR This is an absolute disgusting move to increase such benefits @SenadoPR. You can’t increase working class citizens salaries, protect their benefits, or pensions but you politically benefit one another as politicians. @FOMBPR working class contributing citizen deserve the same!
This negligence falls on you @DeptVetAffairs @NydiaVelazquez we need laws that will prevent citizens &amp; veterans with mental health conditions from obtaining fire arm license.

@DTRHPR @FOMBPR in federal debt &amp; yet the PR governt has extra millions to hand out in bonuses? The same thing weeks  after the hurricane handing out millions in bonuses from @fema federal aid for citizens in need of help and this isn’t mismanagement of funds? @TheJusticeDept
@ricardorossello @DSPnoticias start by eliminating voting privileges to incarcerated violent criminals &amp; stronger laws. Violent criminals in PR are aware that no death penalty is in practice &amp; you provide civilian luxury privileges in prison. This isn’t rehabilitation &amp; they will continue these violent crimes
@NydiaVelazquez We have Veterans with mental health conditions in need of help while the @DeptVetAffairs ignores their conditions or don’t provide the adequate medical attention they deserve. why are they allowed to possess guns after being diagnosed with mental health problems? Who is at fault?
@NydiaVelazquez I agree with you 100% however, attacking Americans 2nd Amendment rights isn’t the answer. Existing guidelines are in place by @DeptVetAffairs to alarm employers &amp; local law enforcement of patients with mental health conditions &amp; yet VA doesn’t disarm VA patients with guns. Why?

@Justicia_PR 3 years for driving under the influence &amp; impacting a citizen with a child?! Are you joking?!  No wonder violent offenders do not fear the judicial system in PR. Your soft in crime &amp; violent offenders are awarded in PR prisons with privileges in exchange for votes in elections.
LEOSA in P.R.! Why is it so complicated to the @PRPDNoticias and the @DSPnoticias respect and understand LEOSA? Is it the poor educational level of PR police? Or not having the adequate understanding in law? Can we have anyone from the @TheJusticeDept educate them? https://t.co/iu5XyRrMtz

@NoticentroWAPA @CarmenYulinCruz in wait of funds to pay? Your district has received millions while you made countless political trips with governt fed funds &amp; you can’t pay our law enforcement community who sacrifice their lives? Yet is ok for you to mismanage funds &amp; not pay what is owe? 👍
@mjean2 is our own working class families who continue to vote for these idiots into office while they attack our schools districts, pensions, &amp; increase our taxes. US Census 2012 with less than 1.3 contributing citizens &amp; over 2.2 million in free housing &amp; food stamps in PR. Shameful!
@primerahora This is what religion has compass to? Shameful.
@FOMBPR How this benefits contributing working class citizens in PR? you have a population over 2 million lazy people costing 2 billion yearly living of a temporary program for generations? They contribute to nothing &amp; make fun of hard working families while the PR governt does nothing.
@SecEducacionPR The reality to this is that our schools are behind in every aspect of advancements just like the governt structure within P.R. All thanks to all Political appointees who have avoided evolving along side the U.S. Don’t fool your self. Your millions in cuts will hurt our society.
@GarciaManny4 @EDUCACIONPR @LeninPR @radioislatv @NoticentroWAPA @SecEducacionPR The @SecEducacionPR is only working to protect politicians interests to save millions a year to only benefit their needs and not of our children’s interests or future. This is an act of an absolute attack towards our society!
@FOMBPR 2 million of non contributing citizens who live at the governt expense for generations collection assistance &amp; living off housing at a cost of 2 billion a year at the cost of US tax dollars. Why not cut their budget? @USDA is a temporary assistance prog not long term!
@trschatz51 Contributing working class citizens along with their children are being victims at the expense of 2 million people who live of the governt in housing &amp; assistance while they contribute to nothing. Cut their budget &amp; force them to work. Stop attacking the working class families.
@trschatz51 The @SenadoPR is to protect our interests at all levels regardless of political interests. Yet, you have allowed the governt to cut millions in our education for children, you increased funds in public assistance at a cost of 2 billion a year. Why? Cut welfare &amp; housing!
Puerto Rican schools threatened https://t.co/0zrPSZaCSz via @wordpressdotcom @nytimes @jayfonsecapr @SecEducacionPR @washingtonpost this is absolutely an embarrassment &amp; a fake display of interest for our children’s education in PR. It’s only about political financial gain!!
@SecEducacionPR @NBCNews It’s disgusting how parents in PR applaud this lady. They spend millions in a charter school &amp; many 👏? your politicians have their children in Private facilities with great resources at US tax payers dollars &amp; our communities schools with poor resources &amp; facilities. Shameful!
@noticel Start your investigation at the local pawn shops near the housing projects. That never fails!! 🤭
@cucusahernandez políticos en PR y el @Justicia_PR solo radican cargos cuando les conviene por intereses. El governt federal lo que tiene que hacer es una auditoria de años con los fundos federales para que hagan un operativo y se lleven a todos y así se acaba el abuso que tienen con el pueblo.
@CarmenYulinCruz @SJUCiudadPatria Is incredible how this lady loves making a fool of her self in social media. You do have only one employee working while you have over 10 others just looking absolutely ridiculous while they do nothing looking up at the sky for 8 hours.
@jayfonsecapr They can go ask for help to the very same political violent criminals who vote for them during elections for privileges from the PR Prisons.
@jayfonsecapr This isn’t anything new! It’s the same with other agencies like the @AEEONLINE with employees who retired without even reporting to work in labor hours and PR governt employees in medical appointments or shopping during work labor hours. What’s the big deal about it now? 🤷‍♂️
@CarmenYulinCruz En esto fue que la gente de San Juan uso sus votos? Que vergüenza!!!!
@CarmenYulinCruz You have no dignity or respect to citizens of P.R. You know very damn well that you fudge numbers and lie to the public. We have elevating violent crimes throughout the island every day. You have no control or the resources to reduce such violent crimes against citizens.
@fortalezapr @DSPnoticias @ricardorossello Your system is poor and weak with no structure or leadership for the PR police department to be an effective agency. Your academy classes are weak in many levels to help assist in knowledge with community policing, relations, public safety, civil rights,&amp; crime scenes. Good luck!
@Jenniffer2012 @VoceroPR Interesting how millions evolve to billions in fed governt funds a year &amp; no one appointed nor a P.R. Politician can’t construct a system to coordinate governt agencies within one another to work effectively &amp; generate revenue  to continue operating? alarming to U.S. tax payers!
@hferrerrios useless continuous debates among politicians in P.R. Sadly none can’t manage nor govern the island to assist the economy. Your all a waste of votes. You take away from hard working families, abuse your government employees pensions &amp; cut education to children. Is that leadership?
@CarmenYulinCruz Guess your ready to go to federal prison for inappropriate federal government funds?
@Johnny_Oaks90 @VoceroPR @SenadoPR @ricardorossello @DSPnoticias @PRPDNoticias Interesting that activity was reported to the @PRPDNoticias at the PR 29 bayamon and no police presence was in the area. They have no remorse for the working class citizens &amp; yet the @SenadoPR spends billions a year in these people in public housing. They need to shut them down!
@VoceroPR @SenadoPR @ricardorossello @DSPnoticias @PRPDNoticias these actions aren’t enough for the continuous disturbances, brutal inappropriate behaviors &amp; trash they polluted within hard working communities in Hato Rey. We deserve better &amp; respect. Our votes count, we aren’t criminals!

@WapaTV It’s absolutely ridiculous how you would lie to citizens with such false informations. This lady is just alike Carmen Yulin. An absolute embarrassment to contributing citizens.
@primerahora @DSPnoticias @PRPDNoticias these crimes against citizens are because of the lack in leadership and protection to communities. Our very own governt left citizens at the hands of criminals last night while they engaged in criminal activity driving in four tracks &amp; dirt bikes.
@Metro_PR @GobernacionSec is because of political credibility you say such ignorance? Every agency the P.R. Governt holds has no consistency and no coordination among one another to support each other financially. The services provided lack in customer service &amp; disciplinary correction.
@primerahora @SenadoPR @DSPnoticias @USDA @ricardorossello this is the type of sick individuals our governt of PR spends billions yearly on? People who don’t contribute to the economy &amp; only lives of fed governt funds by creating disturbances, intimidating working class citizens &amp; no police?
@noticel @DSPnoticias @PRPDNoticias @fortalezapr @SenadoPR @CamaraConPR @nytimes is this what the P.R. Governt calls protection for citizens? They overcrowded our communities with disturbances without any police response. is a display of fear in not holding accountable these criminals.
@noticel Only people with low self esteem who seek such acts of attention have no respect for the law, no remorse for life, no values, norms, nor respect to communities. Why hold such disturbances in an area of contributing citizens? All just to endanger the public. Absolutely anything!
@OSRivera78 @CarmenYulinCruz 😂👍

@TheJusticeDept When will the DOJ take interest in an audit to the Puerto Rico Government in mismanagement of federal government funds?
@utieroficial  https://t.co/nqbJvJMhfT
@NotiUno The DSP recently, under negotiations was granted with law enforcement authority. Before such negotiations, H. Pesquera with DSP employees participated in drug &amp; arrest operations without any type of enforcement authority. But it’s ok to do so being that it’s a political?🤔
@NotiUno People need to realize in PR that the governor of PR created an agency DSP to benefit his long time friend and business partner #HPesquera. This agency in anyway hold no absolute authority over any other agency especially the PR Police Dept. don’t be consume by politicians BS!
@PuertoFor @hortizruiz @CarmenYulinCruz In PR I learn that responding to another incompetent person is a cry out for meaningless attention. Especially, when they speak out of words that hold no credibility and have no knowledge of reality when they only live in a world full of phantasy.
@VictorPares2020 @CamaraConPR @JohnnyMndez36 The public still waits of the previous misconduct and fraud by the @AEEONLINE employees who illegally provided power lines to small business owners after the hurricane for financial gain. What is the status of this investigation? @DSPnoticias @FBISanJuan @PRPDNoticias @nytimes
@noticel Go into a shelter. Don’t display false information so our public feels sorry for others who made bad decisions. Especially, if they left not having a plan or evaluating the consequences. Many people in PR lost everything and yet, they remain here to fight for what’s theirs.
@noticel If this Judge honors this criminal her bail, this displays weakness in our criminal justice system and a slap to the face to the victim and society. She shouldn’t be release into society. This will send a clear message to violent offenders that our system is weak!
@PuertoFor @DCR_PR @PUCPR1 Absolutely true!! Many refuse to speak of this but it’s an embarrassment of the DCR &amp; the government of PR to provide such authority to violent criminals. They leave staff at the mercy of inmates without protection, rights, or tools to fulfill their duties in a safe environment.
@NotiUno This is the origin of the complex problems political parties have created in the island. Debates among politicians blaming each other, and refusing to work for an effective solution to meet the interests of the public and our economy. Move forward and put your salaries to work!!
@CarmenYulinCruz Without a permanent roof?! You didn’t lose anything in your property! You continue to display false information to the public. You should be ashamed!
@primerahora @CarmenYulinCruz I would love to see how much in federal governt funds she utilized for this event 🤔
@GarciaManny4 @utier @FBISanJuan @AEEONLINE @utieroficial @USACEHQ @fema The government of PR is trying to play the devils advocate with the people of PR.

@sfcaponte1 @jaramilloutier The best part of all this is, that the governor and politicians claim that they are ready for hurricane season and yet, they can’t correct the basics.
@luisraul2016 @luisvegaramos The implications that exist in PR is because of political consequences and their incompetence. You project as if you care when you actually do not, and yet you blame others for your failures you alone created. The only victims are the working class &amp; don’t use them as an excuse.
start formal preparations as early as possible to protect your loved once from this upcoming hurricane season in PR. If we are confronted with a category 4 or 5 we will have another crisis. Programs to help prep effectively can be found at https://t.co/kLFftVSRra
@luisraul2016 @luisvegaramos These are consequences towards the continuous years in failures PR politicians created in mismanagement of federal governt funds, negligence in not protecting working class citizens, destroying the economy, &amp; refusing to pay your debt in a responsible manner. Great work! 👍
@utieroficial @RSantosUtier @nyrican_grl @jaramilloutier @publicpowerorg @utier @dionisio07oyola @AEEONLINE The public’s pressure consumes you!

@CarmenYulinCruz What good do you bring forth to our community schools when all you commend is (que cosa)? Perfect example in the incompetence of these politicians who do nothing to protect the public’s interests. Great vote! 👏🏼👍🏼
@NotiUno Politicians in PR are like wolfs, they pray among the weak and later force them out of office for political gain and control. Back to the same question, how is this helping contributing citizens? How is this correcting attacks in the labor work force and economy?

@DCR_PR @VoceroPR @ricardorossello @fortalezapr @SecDCR @BeatrizRossello @EliaEnidCadilla I can tell that politicians are focusing in upcoming elections in providing inmates with privileges for votes. This is why the Correctional system within PR doesn’t work, being that it is crippled with political benefits. This is why crime is high &amp; death penalty isn’t practice.
@HUDDepSec @RepJenniffer @HUDgov We have millions of citizens who cheat the system for generations in PR who aren’t eligible for housing and yet no one enforces nor investigates these issues in PR. Why? Why is the PR governt allowing people to cripple financially, the economy with services they do not need?
@NotiUno @SecEducacionPR @ricardorossello @jayfonsecapr Dr. Santos J. Sepúlveda elementary is one like many of hundreds of schools in your list to close down with outstanding academic performance &amp; high test scores yearly. What excuse you hold in closing down these schools that project high scores?
@primerahora This is absolutely ridiculous how the media feeds false information. No one goes hungry in NY especially, with the many programs available to citizens. If they refuse to work for public assistance &amp; refuse home shelters it’s bqz they wish to do so. But in NY, they must work.
@VoceroPR @VoceroPR obtain your facts correctly when accusing @fema of anything. Stop being political in doing favors to distract our public. If not for our U.S. military, Fema employees, &amp; contractors we would had a crisis in PR. No thanks to AEE or the governor
@utieroficial @jaramilloutier @RSantosUtier @publicpowerorg @utier @dionisio07oyola @AEEONLINE You talk more than what you work. You should had provided generators to those affected areas until service is restored. Families are suffering because of this lack of incompetence.
@NotiUno Is this what leadership has evolve into within PR political parties? They blame each other for their failures, they call outs lies, they have no credibility in anything they say. This will harm &amp; cripple our society until, politicians realize that only listening will benefits all
@CNN Uhmm..🤔 so, are they going to band them from our law enforcement officers or Active military personnel? Good luck with that! 😂
@Metro_PR Is this the type of message you distribute to citizens of PR? We have a struggle within the behaviors that surround our culture and communities. You give attention to a convicted criminal? Great message to our society. 👍
@GarciaManny4 @cate_long At the end the PR governt will never accomplish anything to benefit citizens of PR. Their system within political influence and inappropriate behaviors will continue to lead to poor decisions making &amp; their way of mismanagement fed funds will never benefit the public’s interests.
@DSPnoticias @PRPDNoticias @Justicia_PR @fortalezapr @SecAsuntosPR It’s interesting how the government of PR critics the U.S. Fed Governt but can’t exercise anything without their advice, support, or law enforcement community.

@jayfonsecapr The PR politicians interest are to continue digging enough until they are satisfied with the damage they leave behind crippling the working class communities of PR. At the end politicians walk out as millionaires without remorse to the damage they leave behind to society.
@CarmenYulinCruz Last time I recalled the office has not neglected anything in assisting PR in Aid. @realDonaldTrump Stop passing incorrect information to the public especially with your political BS @CarmenYulinCruz You don’t need more billions from FEMA for your political pockets &amp; bonuses.

@primerahora It’s absolutely ridiculous how the government of PR has continue obtaining billions since hurricane Maria and yet, these people are going bankrupt? This proves that the government of PR is incompetent when managing federal governt funds nor able to provide effective solutions.
How were those interventions justify having an agency with civilians who participated in law enforcement arrest not having that authority during previous interventions? What’s wrong with this? @jayfonsecapr anything wrong with this picture? How does the courts allow such acts?
@PRPDNoticias @TheJusticeDept @jayfonsecapr the department @DSPnoticias is undergoing law enforcement trainings to initiate the same duties as the PR Police. the DSP was involved in a few police interventions &amp; arrest in the past without possessing such authority at the moment.

@CamaraConPR @JohnnyMndez36 @ricardorossello These attacks to our working families who earn their salaries are reflections in failures from the very same political groups who govern our islands. You fail to acknowledge that every decision you enact into society only displays your incompetence.
@csaavedraDTRH @ricardorossello Anything in decision making that affects or attacks our society interests is a failure of our own governt &amp; political parties.

@GarciaManny4 Agree with you a 💯 %
@noticel @stevenmnuchin1 did they provided the adequate information in documents with credibility, to convince you to make such modifications? All this was done in less than half a day? You can adjust continuous modifications for them &amp; they will continue to fail the public’s needs.
@law_melendez Exactly!
@law_melendez You walk into a bank for a business loan &amp; expect success explaining ideas verbally to a loan officer with no support in proposal documents, no research in your business, &amp; no credibility. Will that get you a loan? That’s how the governt administ in PR likes to negotiate.
@JoseADelgadoEND @Jenniffer2012 @ElNuevoDia Don’t act surprised. This is a continuous political game among politicians for years. You call out people who make more money than you then fight with one another while at the end our citizens get screwed paying your riches. Game of thrones in PR politics!
@ElNuevoDia Are you kidding me. With the continuous request in fed governt funds and yet, you have no effective strategy to help support the island. Your using funds to patch up areas and have no solutions to obtain a way to generate funds to continue operating. Your crippling PR!
@PuertoFor @NotiUno @fema @Jenniffer2012 @CarmenYulinCruz is this effective governt management? You spend countless hours in resources in areas that don’t contribute to help society nor the economy &amp; yet, you owe money to the PR police depart? Your political escorts are always paid. The excuse is?
You can cut funds within that area to help support local governt agencies and local labor services. You keep increasing public assistance benefits for people who claim that they can’t work but then again they drive better vehicles &amp; live better than the contributing citizen. 🤔
@ricardorossello @jayfonsecapr @trschatz51 you issue billions a year in fed funds to keep over 180 million in public assistance with no interest to build programs that will make them contribute back into the economy. Why not target millions in assistance to work &amp; contribute?
@normandoh @CarmenYulinCruz They claim that we have no money, and eliminate bonuses &amp; benefits from contributing citizens. But at the end their own bonuses &amp; increases in salary benefits will never be affected.

Will they be monitoring to the last cent? Are these funds an urgent need for these areas for spending? How is this helping the economy in PR &amp; how will these funds be paid?
@noticel this smells like another fishy political plan for financial gain 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰 at the end of this continuous phase all we can expect is the suffering of our contributing citizens.
@NotiUno Religion shouldn’t cross paths with political issues nor when the criminal justice strikes down. If we allow religion to get involved in political influences then, what is religion then? We need balance, trust, dignity, &amp; honor. That which our governt doesn’t hold to the public.

@EDUCACIONPR @SecEducacionPR @BeatrizRossello @ricardorossello @fortalezapr @Itza_M_Garcia @LuisRiveraMarin @VillafanePR @SecAsuntosPR @AbelNazarioPR Today with many other volunteers, we are assisting our local community school in today’s class sessions to help working parents meet their daily work schedules. Walking out in our future children isn’t a solution against political appointees who hold no values or interests to PR.
@ram_wanda @EDUCACIONPR The public’s power to vote into office elected officials are obligated to listen,meet public’s interests, &amp; needs for effective solutions. politicians ignoring our public’s calls to meet hold no remorse or interests in the citizens of PR.  people in office that can’t be trusted.
@noticel @utier don’t try to obtain support from the public when your involvement within the political parties have created enough damage with the @AEEONLINE and now a bigger mess with the most incompetent enactment in education. You continue making changes without the public’s interests.
@EDUCACIONPR In order to move forward in society, we need to embrace changes. but when it’s something forced into our communities without our public’s input &amp; based out of political appointees who lack in leadership, structure, &amp; no hard field study in research to show support is a disaster.
@GarciaManny4 These people are appointed only for financial gain &amp; nothing for our public’s best interest. It’s truly, harmful to society &amp; our future when we have political parties only focus in our public’s contributions. 💰💰💰
@melgonzalez0935 @primerahora in U.S. a small percent in locations targeted specific community class to benefit those locations. sadly, we heard the hearings &amp; so-called experts lacked in resources to support their verbal expertise. Our public’s interests, teachers, &amp; students input is vital for success in PR
@melgonzalez0935 @primerahora Can you explain or show the time of study in research conducted in this enactment? Who where the study subjects in the field? When will people realize that in order to have effective solutions we need TIME &amp; revenue to study areas that benefit the public and not political groups.
@melgonzalez0935 @primerahora Mr. Gonzalez, did ever occurred that my federal status along with information oversees beyond what you won’t see? This holds no interest in improving anything. This was enacted to show who holds control &amp; not of any further interest in our children nor the educational system.
@yasomerc @noticel I thank you for your commitment in walking out in our students. I thank you for thinking of them first &amp; I thank you for punishing children and depriving them from education. Your an absolute role model! 👍 your just as good as the same political group leading by example.
@yasomerc @noticel If you called that education, then our children future are in jeopardy! Great work! This is what communities count in educating our children. 👍
@bluelivesmtr This is a reminder to all our brothers and sisters in blue, that our system does not honor our daily sacrifice protecting our public. This is what they call justice for law enforcement? We want the death penalty to criminals who take a blue life, not parole!

@noticel Your actions in walking out towards your commitment in service to our children and communities is punishing and depriving our kids from their education. Your behavior is as equal as the incompetence of the very same political groups who bring no good into our society.

@NotiUno We have other effective tools as citizens to bring forth issues that impact our society. But, this poor level of behavior by teachers is one that, I wouldn’t want my child in any of their classrooms. Lowering our standards will not lead to positive results like these people.
@PRPDNoticias @DSPnoticias @Justicia_PR @fortalezapr for a successful transition in the reduction in crimes, you must establish community relations with communities. communities are a valuable asset to combat crime areas. Creating police training programs to get community leaders involved will build confidence &amp; reduce crime.

It’s ridiculous how our Americans public focuses to debate a governt purchase of a table.

@kbo8898 @nytimes Absolutely a 💯! If you don’t live in PR nor had the benefit to work within both governt branches you won’t see or understand.Its a waste bqz over 80% of rent their aparts to drug lords or other people while owning homes to make money of HUD. No monitoring or control by governt.

@bluelivesmtr The police department doesn’t need to answer anything to this guy. He was detain as in protocol with an active shooter. The information part in assuring the schools or public are aware falls under their own jurisdiction. Our law enforcement officer lives are first at all coast.
@Jenniffer2012 why raised utilities to our citizens when your government received millions?! Why are only the small working class citizens who pay contributions being targeted? Do you increase rents yearly to public housing &amp; utilities? Do they pay back to governt the billions in assistance?
@NotiUno What justification is in placed for increase in water? Is it because they have so much water from the continues rains? This is absolutely abusing our citizens.
@NotiUno Let’s me honest Governor. His political influence placed him on this position &amp; it wasn’t bqz of his experience. His salary is more than the PR Superintendent who is in charge of the police department &amp; our public’s safety.
@NotiUno That was just a display of talk from an individual who doesn’t accept that he has no knowledge in what he is doing. The same when he ran the police department. He drank more coffee out of his office than crimes fighting or helping our the police department.
@NotiUno It’s exactly what I said before. Pesquera takes authority away from our Police department &amp; of the superintendent of the Police. No absolute leadership, structure, or effective communication between each other. A clear weakness combating crimes against our public.
@NotiUno You pay $248,500 a year to this guy and he can’t even reduce crimes against our citizens?! He can’t protect our communities nor display any interest in working with our citizens to hear out community concerns that may help police target crimes areas more effectively. Great job!
@yucahuhijodeat5 @NotiUno I believe it. It’s a shame that it’s generated from hard working citizens taxes.
@NotiUno This position in PR is an absolute waste of tax payers dollars that Pesquera holds. We have a police superintendent &amp; why we need another useless person on board doing absolutely nothing for our communities?!
@NotiUno I am sorry Pesquera. But people need to understand when it’s time to go. You served our citizens of PR &amp; at times in political affairs you need to watch what bores out of your mouth.
@UnivisionPR It’s embarrassing to know that people fled our island and many still say they can’t find employment. We have millions of undocumented immigrants who quickly find work &amp; become contributing citizens but our people in PR not being immigrants can’t find employment? 🤔
@washingtonpost @SenadoPR you should enact this ASAP in PR. This will force the millions of people out of welfare who you maintain in public assistance &amp; free housing who do absolutely nothing to contribute to the islands economy nor their lives. It will save @USDA millions in tax payers dollars
