The @DeptofDefense runs the largest employer-sponsored child care program in the country, caring for over 200,000 kids. It’s the kind of high-quality, affordable child care that should be in every family’s reach – and it’s the model for my #UniversalChildCare plan. https://t.co/EUZcQAIU2K

Whether you have kids, grandkids, or no kids at all – America's children are our country's future. That means we have an interest, and a responsibility, to invest in them. Let’s start by making #UniversalChildCare a reality. https://t.co/T5QxmQipld
My #UltraMillionaireTax on America’s wealthiest families could fund #UniversalChildCare, giving millions of kids a leg up. And by offering parents more options to balance work and family, we could also help boost our economy.
In many states, child care is more expensive than in-state college tuition. Under my plan for #UniversalChildCare, child care would be free for nearly 9 million kids. And no family would pay more than 7% of their income for child care.
My plan for #UniversalChildCare would build off the success of Head Start to create a network of high-quality child care options. Federal funding would guarantee every family has access to high-quality, affordable care for kids from birth to kindergarten.
When my kids were little, I struggled to find good, reliable, and affordable child care. It felt like an impossible task then – and it still is for many families. That’s why I’m proposing a new plan for #UniversalChildCare. https://t.co/95soeZa5wx

Of course, we can’t forget the most recent @WellsFargo scandal that took place right under Tim Sloan’s nose. The bank has been gouging students with triple the fees of its competitors on college campuses. https://t.co/kKrm0u9cXc

Americans are an adaptive, resilient people, and we have met hard challenges head on before. We can work together, as we have before, to strengthen democracy at home and abroad. We can build a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just wealthy elites.
55 years ago, when President John F. Kennedy spoke at @AmericanU, he said that, “our problems are manmade--therefore, they can be solved by man.” The same is true today. 		(OK, I’d add that they can also be solved by women, too.)
The time for holding back is over. Patriots of every political persuasion must stand up to this type of behavior. Americans must demonstrate to @realdDonaldTrump and to the world that we are not sliding toward autocracy – not without a fight.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions and instincts align with those of authoritarian regimes around the globe. And he is aided and abetted every step of the way by Republican politicians too pleased with his judicial appointments and tax cuts to stand up for fundamental American values.
Here’s the thing about authoritarian governments – they are rotten from the inside out. Authoritarian leaders talk a big game, but their system is rotten because, by its very design, it stacks the decks for the wealthy and depends on corruption in order to survive.
It also requires us to speak out against hateful rhetoric that fuels domestic terrorism of all kinds. We must speak plainly about all of these incidents. Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda &amp; ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with US values.
We must remain vigilant and fight for our democracy every single day. That starts with protecting our elections and democratic processes, and making it clear that there will be severe consequences for those – foreign or domestic – who meddle, hack, or undermine them.
Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve national security. A 21st century industrial policy, for example, would produce good jobs that provide dignity, respect, and a living wage, and it would also reinforce US international economic power.
A foreign policy that works for all Americans must recognize that America can project power abroad only if we are strong and secure at home. But every day, shortsighted domestic policies are weakening our national strength.
Let me propose three core nuclear security principles: 	1. No new nuclear weapons. 	2. More international arms control, not less.	3. No first use.
America should also be reinvesting in diplomacy. Foreign policy shouldn't be run exclusively by the Pentagon. Yes, we should expect our partners to pay their fair share. But diplomacy isn't about charity; it's about advancing US interests.
It is time to identify which programs actually benefit American security in the 21st century, and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. Then pull out a sharp knife and make some cuts.
The defense industry will inevitably have a seat at the table – but they shouldn’t get to own the table. US security and values should come ahead of the profit margins of private companies.
.@realDonaldTrump has refused to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he's more interested in appeasing defense contractors than holding the Saudis accountable for murdering a @washingtonpost journalist or for the thousands of Yemeni civilians killed by those weapons.
How do we responsibly cut back? We can start by ending the stranglehold of defense contractors on our military policy. It’s clear that the Pentagon is captured by defense contractors – and taxpayers are picking up the bill.
Let’s cut our bloated defense budget. The US will spend more than $700 billion on defense this year alone. That is more than President Reagan spent during the Cold War. If more money for the Pentagon could solve our security challenges, we would have solved them by now.
Let’s make sure that the three brave Americans killed in Afghanistan this week, including one who grew up in Boston, are the last Americans to lose their lives in this war. It’s time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan – starting now.
Yes, we can – and we we must – continue to be vigilant about the threats of terrorism, whether from Afghanistan or anywhere else. But rather than fighting in an Afghan civil war, let’s help them reach a realistic peace settlement that halts the violence and protects our security.
For nearly 2 decades, this country has been mired in a series of wars – conflicts that sap American strength. The human costs of these wars has been staggering: more than 6,900 Americans killed, another 52k wounded. Many more who live every day with the invisible scars of war.
All three of my brothers served in the military. I know that our servicemembers and their families are smart, tough, and resourceful. But a strong military should act as a deterrent so that most of the time, we won’t have to use it.
Just last week, our own government said that climate change is already happening and will dramatically endanger the world we share. The threat is real and existential – and we need to take action, now.
Our economic policies should also address the challenges of today’s interconnected world, including areas like corruption, privacy and data rights, and climate change.
We need a new approach to trade, and it should begin with a simple principle: our policies should not prioritize corporate profits over American paychecks.  That should be true for NAFTA and true for every deal we cut.
.@realDonaldTrump grabs headlines railing against @GM’s plans to axe thousands of American jobs in Ohio and Michigan – but his actual policies aren’t stopping them or other like them from continuing to put corporate profits ahead of American workers. It’s time for real change.
I oppose NAFTA 2.0, and I will vote against it in the Senate unless @realDonaldTrump reopens the agreement and produces a better deal for America’s working families.
There’s no question we need to renegotiate NAFTA. But as it’s currently written, Trump’s deal won’t stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won’t stop outsourcing, it won’t raise wages, and it won’t create jobs. It’s NAFTA 2.0.
For decades, leaders of both parties preached the gospel that free trade was a rising tide that would lift all boats. Great rhetoric – except that the trade deals they negotiated mainly lifted the yachts – and threw millions of working Americans overboard to drown.
Our country is in a moment of crisis decades in the making. America’s middle class has been hollowed out, working people have been betrayed, and democracy itself is under threat. It’s time to create a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just the rich and powerful.

I’m joining the entire MA delegation to urge @realDonaldTrump to approve federal assistance for Merrimack Valley families, businesses &amp; communities. https://t.co/GQYhslaMfg
Banks are making a record amount of loans to companies swimming in debt, then pushing the risk to investors. Just like the pre-2008 subprime mortgage market, it’s a ticking time bomb that could blow another hole in our economy. Regulators must take action – before it’s too late. https://t.co/RiV6WFk1H1
A deal's a deal. After the @RedSox #BeatLA, @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris were good sports and settled their World Series wager with @SenMarkey and me.

Americans know Washington isn’t working for them. But instead of giving up, more and more people are demanding a government that is run by the people, for the people – and my plan to #EndCorruptionNow would do just that. https://t.co/b47OCAhHjy
The wealthy and well-connected want to keep Americans divided and stop us from fighting back against a rigged system. But change is coming to Washington, and we’re going to put the power back where it belongs – in the hands of the people. https://t.co/7XZg8gXMwy
We have to follow through on our promises to our veterans. Congress expanded the GI Bill – now the VA needs to ensure vets get what they’ve earned. I introduced a bipartisan bill to make sure vets aren’t penalized financially for the VA’s mistakes. The Senate should pass it. https://t.co/ajrF21tEiy
My heart goes out to everyone affected by the deadly California wildfires, especially those who have lost loved ones. Grateful to the many brave firefighters &amp; first responders who are putting their lives on the line to keep others safe, today and every day. America is with you.
All 3 of my older brothers served in the military. This #VeteransDay, I’m grateful for the service of our veterans and their families, and I'll keep working with my colleagues in both parties to put them first.
Yemen is in crisis – and we can no longer look the other way. Cutting off US refueling support is a start, but it’s too little, too late. We cannot continue selling the Saudis weapons that kill Yemeni civilians. We cannot continue to support this war. https://t.co/N9PmkB2LJb
For over 3 years, the US has helped the Saudi-led coalition bomb Yemen with few constraints. Thousands of civilians died in airstrikes. When I asked the Pentagon if it tracked the Saudi aircraft we refueled and the targets struck, they said they didn’t. https://t.co/uhi4WKLD2H
Wall Street fat cat @SecretaryRoss had huge financial interests in Chevron, Boeing &amp; Greenbrier but met with their CEOs anyway – potentially violating conflict of interest laws. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would prohibit these financial conflicts. https://t.co/jWdFVv7BXa
This week, @realDonaldTrump took his latest dangerous step in violating the #IranDeal, which has successfully blocked Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb since 2015. Unilateral withdrawal from this agreement isolates us from our allies and makes us less safe. https://t.co/lNTzAQdXlU

Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting. So far, Brett Kavanaugh has refused over and over again to submit to one. He lied repeatedly while under oath. I don’t know when the full Senate will ultimately vote. But NOW is the time to make your voice heard.
One way for Brett Kavanaugh to clear his name is to submit to an FBI investigation. But he refuses. And he won't release the thousands of documents from his gov't service. What is he hiding? A Justice should have honesty &amp; integrity. Kavanaugh has neither – he should withdraw.

The events described by Julie Swetnick, Ms. Ramirez &amp; Dr. Ford are absolutely heart-wrenching. The idea that the Senate would continue this confirmation process without an FBI investigation is even more revolting.	 	@realDonaldTrump must withdraw Brett Kavanaugh's nomination.
Why do Republicans continue to stand behind Brett Kavanaugh? Why does @realDonaldTrump want Rod Rosenstein out?		Simple: They want to protect the wealthy and well-connected above all else. And they’re willing to run over anyone who gets in their way. https://t.co/hk3KaCGGS9

My new bill:	✅Makes record investments to build homes including in rural areas.	✅Gets localities to scrap zoning rules that make housing more expensive.	✅Helps first-time homebuyers in formerly redlined areas.	✅Offers relief to families still struggling after the 2008 crash.
I’m introducing the American Housing &amp; Economic Mobility Act to build 3 million new homes in 10 years, bring down monthly rents by 10%, &amp; create 1.5 million jobs. By asking 10k of the richest families to pay their fair share, it doesn’t add to the deficit. https://t.co/AaJqd63MWF

If @realDonaldTrump is ready to force out Rod Rosenstein, how much longer until he goes after Special Counsel Mueller? Every resignation and firing brings us one step closer to a constitutional crisis. Congress must immediately pass the bipartisan bill to protect Mueller.
If Republicans have blocked an FBI investigation, bullied Dr. Ford, &amp; tried to "plow right through" &amp; put Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court – all while holding onto credible information about a second sexual misconduct claim – then this isn’t a confirmation.

The Climate Risk Disclosure Act will help investors determine climate-related risks, encourage markets to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, &amp; reduce the risks of an environmental and financial catastrophe – all without spending a dime of taxpayer money.
Markets need to take the many complex risks posed by climate change into account. This isn’t a radical new idea – @algore proposed something similar years ago. It’s a concrete step we can take today. https://t.co/dG0xnFbskO
On the other hand, if the global community follows through on commitments to limit global warming and move away from the use of fossil fuels, oil and gas companies could be worth a lot less.
If climate change continues at this rate, sea levels will rise – putting companies with physical assets near shorelines at risk. More frequent superstorms will interfere with shipping. Longer droughts will result in higher food costs. That can all affect a company’s bottom line.
My new Climate Risk Disclosure Act would force public companies to disclose critical information about how climate change could affect the value of their assets so that investors can make smart decisions with their money.
Before the 2008 crash, investors and the government failed to address growing risks in our financial system. We’re making the same mistake with climate change today – we know it’s coming, but we’re not doing enough to stop it. I'm introducing major legislation to help fix that. https://t.co/O1mZhdYLVk

.@realDonaldTrump’s pick to run the @CFPB said she doesn’t disagree with a single thing @MickMulvaneyOMB has done. The Senate should reject Kathy Kraninger’s nomination unless she commits to reverse Mulvaney’s betrayals of students and stand up for American consumers.
The @CFPB has returned $750 million to scammed student borrowers. But today, the agency’s top student loan watchdog resigned – because @MickMulvaneyOMB is siding with greedy student loan companies over students and military families. Disgraceful. https://t.co/ct92JofPMO
I count it as a blessing to have had the honor to serve with John McCain in the Senate and on the Armed Services Committee. If there ever was a true American patriot, John was that patriot. I’ll miss his strength and his maverick spirit, but most of all I’ll miss his kindness. https://t.co/UzYvlRN1No
Democrat or Republican, foreign leader or President of the US, John McCain would go toe to toe with anyone to fight for what he thought was right. At a time when character &amp; integrity are under siege, we all mourn the loss of a public servant who lived with courage &amp; conviction.
John McCain and I disagreed on many things, and sometimes quite forcefully. But even when we disagreed, I always respected that his heart was focused on doing what he thought was best for the American people.
John McCain was fiercely devoted to his family, his constituents, and his country. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this difficult time. As a nation, we all share in the sense of emptiness his passing has left behind.
The GOP is trying everything it can to weaken unions. But we're fighting back every step of the way, &amp; it's paying off. A federal judge just struck down key pieces of @realDonaldTrump’s executive orders designed to roll back federal workers' rights. This is a big win for workers. https://t.co/s5sV4qFCar

Americans know Washington isn’t working for them. But instead of giving up, more &amp; more people are demanding a government that is run by the people for the people – and I have a plan to do that. Here’s my speech outlining my new bill to #EndCorruptionNow:	https://t.co/IOnB9zehDl
.@EricCantor, have you been listening? You spent so much time schmoozing with the rich and powerful that your constituents voted you out. Then you went to work for Wall Street. I’m shocked – SHOCKED – you don’t like my bill to #EndCorruptionNow. https://t.co/f7upTp3iCO
Since introducing my bill to #EndCorruptionNow this AM: Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign crimes. Paul Manafort convicted on tax fraud. Rep. Duncan Hunter indicted for misuse of campaign funds. And these are just the guys who've been caught.	 	Time to clean up Washington.
Today I introduced a sweeping anti-corruption bill to clean up Washington. My reforms would make it flatly illegal for Americans to work as lobbyists for foreign governments. Congress should pass this law so we never see another snake like Paul Manafort again. #EndCorruptionNow
Paul Manafort lied about lobbying for a foreign government and got rich. And it's shocking that @realDonaldTrump's campaign mgr has been convicted of criminal tax fraud. But it's insane that ANYONE is allowed to take shady foreign cash to lobby our government. #EndCorruptionNow
I plan to fight to pass as many of these reforms as possible. I believe we can break the stranglehold that the wealthy and well-connected hold over our government. I believe we can get democracy working again. #EndCorruptionNow
Inside Washington, some of these proposals will be very unpopular, even with my friends. Outside Washington, I expect that most people will see these ideas as no-brainers and be shocked they’re not already law. #EndCorruptionNow
Build a new anticorruption agency to make sure that all key federal officials – even powerful Senators and Presidents – file disclosures and get rid of conflicts. #EndCorruptionNow
Big Change Number Six – Hire a new independent sheriff to police corruption. There are dedicated public servants that enforce our ethics laws – but they have less authority than security guards at the mall. #EndCorruptionNow
Strengthen the code of conduct for all federal judges – no stock trading, no payments from corporations for attending events, no honoraria for giving speeches, no lavish getaways &amp; fancy hunting trips funded by billionaires. &amp; I mean all federal judges, including SCOTUS justices.
Fifth Big Change – Restore faith that ordinary people can get a fair shake in our courts. #EndCorruptionNow
Prosecute companies that knowingly mislead government agencies. And stop the practice of companies paying for sham “studies” designed to derail the rulemaking process. #EndCorruptionNow
Fourth Big Change – End corporate capture of rulemaking. #EndCorruptionNow
We should ban Americans from getting paid to lobby for foreign governments – period. If foreign governments want to express their views, they can use their diplomats. #EndCorruptionNow
Start by fixing the Swiss cheese definition of a “lobbyist.”  Require everyone who gets paid to influence government to register. And bring that lobbying out into the sunlight. Make every single meeting between a lobbyist and a public official a matter of public record.
Third Big Change – End lobbying as we know it. #EndCorruptionNow
Presidents should not be able to own companies on the side. And we shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let the American people see their financial interests. That should be the law – not just for presidential candidates, but for every candidate for every federal office.
Second Big Change – Stop self-dealing by public officials. If a person works for the government, then that person should serve the public. No making policy decisions to help yourself instead of taxpayers. #EndCorruptionNow
Ban elected and appointed officials from becoming lobbyists after they leave office. Not for 1 year.  Not for 2 years. For the rest of their lives. No special deals for millions and millions of dollars to the policymakers who will be in a position to pay back their old employers.
First Big Change – Padlock the revolving door between big business and government. #EndCorruptionNow
The problem is enormous – but we’ve dealt with enormous problems before. We just need some big reform ideas and a willingness to fight for real change. #EndCorruptionNow
There’s no real question that the @realDonaldTrump era has given us the most nakedly corrupt leadership this nation has seen in our lifetimes. But they are not the cause of the rot – they’re just the biggest, stinkiest example of it. #EndCorruptionNow
These reforms have one simple aim: to take power in Washington away from  the wealthy, the powerful, and the well-connected who have corrupted our  government and put power back in the hands of the American people.  #EndCorruptionNow
Today, I’m introducing the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation proposed in Congress since Watergate. This is an aggressive set of reforms that would fundamentally change the way Washington does business. #EndCorruptionNow
Our government systematically favors the rich over the poor, the donor class over the working class, the well-connected over the disconnected.  This is deliberate, and we need to call it for what it is – corruption, plain and simple. #EndCorruptionNow

The Supreme Court – thanks to a seat stolen by right-wing Republicans – just upheld Trump’s Muslim ban. While the Court ruled it’s legal, the American people still know it isn’t right. And together, we'll keep fighting against religious discrimination, xenophobia, &amp; hate. (2/2)
Last year, I joined hundreds of people at Logan Airport to protest @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban. We believed that the courts would ultimately overturn it – because it didn’t make us any safer, and it clearly violated America’s core values. We were wrong. (1/2) https://t.co/E0NigZxunc
I believe that when a woman flees the only home she's ever known with her 4-year-old son and begs the United States of America for asylum, she deserves a fair hearing. I believe that every human being has worth. We must do better.
I spoke with one woman from El Salvador at a CBP processing center. She  gave a policeman a drink of water, and the gangs came after her. She sold everything she had and fled with her 4-year-old son because their lives were in danger.

Let’s be clear: @realDonaldTrump's gag rule isn't about improving women’s health care. It's an attempt to control women and shut down Title X providers that offer critical reproductive care. It’s right-wing ideology disguised as health policy. https://t.co/eHi45WAoMD
Car dealers are exempt from @CFPB oversight – and auto loan defaults just hit a 15-year high. That's not a coincidence. It's what happens when shady lending practices go unchecked. https://t.co/83jrJdauyF
Even as banks make record profits, their former banker buddies turned regulators are doing them favors by rolling back a rule that protects taxpayers from another bailout. This kind of corruption is common in @realDonaldTrump’s Washington. https://t.co/jECa7oWhJT
Thousands of students were cheated by for-profit colleges, but @BetsyDeVosED wants to stop students from getting the full loan forgiveness they deserve. So, I called for an investigation. Now a federal judge has agreed with me &amp; stopped her illegal scheme. https://t.co/8PWmtFXzjV
.@Walmart rakes in billions from the #GOPTaxScam and sends the profits straight to Wall Street, while many employees struggle to put food on the dinner table. These share buybacks are a perfect example of how our economy is rigged against working families. https://t.co/A9H8Adtzv0
In another example of weak enforcement that will harm our economy, the DOJ just approved the @Bayer-@MonsantoCo merger, placing enormous power in the hands of one agribusiness giant. This deal is a brutal blow to small &amp; family farmers, as well as our food supply. https://t.co/XFVYbvGrJk
The official death count in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria is only 64. A new study shows the real total could be 70x that. For months, I've pushed for an accurate gov't count to learn the full extent of this tragedy. It's disgraceful we're still waiting. https://t.co/uDYGca05LG https://t.co/6nazdgPsy1
All 3 of my brothers served &amp; came home safe. But many do not. I had the chance to honor a special group of veterans by dedicating a new POW/MIA Chair of Honor in the Capitol.

Update: Brian Montgomery has been confirmed by the Senate 74 to 23. In Donald Trump’s Washington, the revolving door spins faster and faster.
The #BankLobbyistAct was just signed into law – rolling back rules on big banks. But bank lobbyists are already asking Congress for another round of favors. Washington won't stop this cycle until the American people demand it.https://t.co/eeSnK0ALNQ
President Trump’s wild back and forth with Kim Jong Un shows once again that he has no strategy. If @realdonaldtrump wants to demonstrate real leadership, he needs to develop a plan and commit to work towards a peaceful resolution with North Korea.

We should be expanding – not limiting – women’s access to reproductive health care. Instead, the GOP is attacking services that prevent unplanned pregnancies, women's access to STI &amp; cancer screenings, &amp; their right to make their own reproductive choices. https://t.co/oJo8ewgKvY
Big banks have spent millions of dollars trying to roll back the rules we put in place after we bailed them out ten years ago. Today, they got what they paid for. The House just passed the #BankLobbyistAct. We lost this round – but we won't give up the fight. https://t.co/ppFj9SUm1M
In a decision written by Justice Gorsuch, the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations can block workers from suing together over major violations of their rights, like sexual harassment, discrimination, &amp; wage theft. Congress should act to reverse this terrible decision. https://t.co/k6742lLlhV
For years, armies of bank lobbyists &amp; executives have groaned about how financial rules are hurting them. But there's a big problem with their story – banks are making record profits. Congress has done enough favors for big banks – the House should reject the #BankLobbyistAct. https://t.co/x95rfTYBUL
The #BankLobbyistAct rolls back the rules on big banks &amp; increases the risk of another taxpayer bailout. It could pass the House tomorrow. This is our last chance to stop this bill from becoming law. Washington has heard enough from the lobbyists – it's time they hear from you.

We're going to keep fighting back against @realdonaldtrump, @VP Pence, and right-wing politicians who want to regulate women's bodies and shut down Planned Parenthood. Women's reproductive health care is health care. Period. #StandwithPP  https://t.co/kmLaPxRi4I
.@realdonaldtrump's gag rule is designed to kick providers like Planned Parenthood out of Title X &amp; hold women hostage to the GOP's agenda. Title X patients won't be able to learn about all their reproductive options – worsening health care disparities &amp; reducing access to care.
Title X provides birth control, cancer screenings &amp; HIV tests to over 4M Americans. It doesn’t fund abortions &amp; never has. But today, @realdonaldtrump will issue a “gag” rule that will stop Title X doctors from even talking to their patients about abortion-related services. https://t.co/3LFHjd4Yli

Even the Trump Administration has conceded that Iran is complying with the deal. Now @realdonaldtrump has pulled out without offering any real alternative to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Creating chaos and confusion isn’t a strategy – it’s a recipe for disaster.

Harry from Hull, MA told the @CFPB about his son’s shady auto-loan. The agency looked into his complaint &amp; forced those companies to refund $6.5 million to over 50k active-duty servicemembers. Harry came to the hearing today because he wants the @CFPB to keep helping people.
One of those people is Ari. Before he deployed to Iraq, he bought a truck and got pushed into a subprime auto-loan scam that cost him more than 60% of his monthly paycheck. His dad Harry contacted the @CFPB on his behalf while he was deployed.
I just finished questioning @MickMulvaneyOMB in a Senate hearing. Before he started running the @CFPB, he tried to kill it repeatedly. If he’d gotten his wish, billions of dollars would still be sitting at the companies that cheated customers – instead of the people they cheated.

I'm grateful to Ambassador Branstad, our diplomats, and the many representatives from other US government agencies who proudly represent our country in Beijing and at our consulates throughout China. https://t.co/Zij2IKYdPL
With Vice Premier Liu He, I had an extensive discussion about how China's trade-distorting measures end up hurting American workers. I've long been skeptical of trade policy – both at home and abroad – that caters to big corporations instead of working families.
In my meetings with Chinese government officials, we discussed the challenge posed by North Korea and the need for a diplomatic solution. I urged China to continue enforcing international sanctions until we see clear evidence that North Korea has changed its behavior.
In Beijing, I had candid discussions with Chinese officials about US-China relations, acknowledging both our shared interests and our areas of disagreement, including my concerns about China's treatment of human rights.

Defeating a public health epidemic like the opioid crisis isn't easy. It takes major resources, local control, &amp; the courage to combat stigmas. But we know what needs to be done. We've come together before to save lives – it's time for us to do so again. https://t.co/yotQ1IA8dq
Just like HIV/AIDS, we should ensure that every single American who needs addiction treatment and support gets it, without delay. That’s how we end the opioid crisis – not with speeches, but with treatment.
Our proposal isn't about public declarations and empty words. Just like HIV/AIDS, we need to provide communities that are battling the opioid epidemic every day with the funding and tools they so desperately need.
The Ryan White CARE Act transformed how America treats HIV/AIDS. Congress must show the same political courage on opioids that our colleagues showed 30 years ago. @RepCummings and I propose a parallel approach for opioids – investing in research &amp; in treatment at the local level.
Thanks to the Ryan White CARE Act, over half a million people a year with HIV/AIDS receive vital services. The epidemic isn’t over – but now life-saving medications are available, new infections have plummeted, and science – rather than stigma – guides medical care.
In 1990, Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked together to pass the bipartisan Ryan White CARE Act – named in honor of a teen from Indiana who was diagnosed with AIDS at age 13. The law transformed our approach to treatment and provided significant new funding.
Three decades ago, an epidemic swept across our country, killing tens of thousands of people each year. Stigma prevented many from seeking treatment. Doctors and lawmakers alike were stumped on how to treat this rapidly evolving crisis. It wasn't opioids – it was HIV/AIDS.
Politicians treat the opioid crisis like it's some new, intractable problem. It's not. 30 years ago, Congress passed a law to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic – and it worked. Today, @RepCummings and I call on Congress to pass a similar law for opioids. https://t.co/yotQ1IA8dq
Tom Hoenig – a top banking regulator &amp; political Independent – said the #BankLobbyistAct makes a serious mistake by weakening capital standards for big banks. He’s right.

If we want to make the promise of our legal system real, then everyone must be held equally accountable when they break our laws. We can start by bringing the white supremacists who attacked DeAndre Harris in Charlottesville to justice.

These aren't “community banks” – these are huge financial institutions that wrecked out economy in 2008 &amp; sucked down about $50 billion in taxpayer bailouts. The #BankLobbyistAct takes them off the watch list &amp; puts us at risk for another financial crisis.https://t.co/kqrJ4p2bG0
Zions Bancorporation got $1.4 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis. But last spring the CEO begged to be taken off the government watch list. He got his wish – the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @ZionsBank as your local community bank.
Comerica Incorporated controls about $72 billion in assets today &amp; has naming rights to a MLB stadium – but taxpayers spent $2.25 billion bailing it out during the 2008 financial crisis. And the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @ComericaCares as if it were a tiny community bank.

Regions Financial Corporation has about 1,500 branches and 1,900 ATMs. It also got $3.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. If the #BankLobbyistAct passes, @askRegions could get the same level of federal oversight as a small community bank.
Keycorp is doing pretty well these days – it made almost $1.3 billion last year. That’s a lot of growth since the 2008 crash, when it got $2.5 billion in taxpayer bailouts. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate KeyCorp as if it were a small community bank.

BB&amp;T Corporation has over 2,000 branches across the country and controls $221 billion in assets. It received $3.13 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crash. But the #BankLobbyistAct could apply the same rules to @BBT as your neighborhood community bank.
SunTrust Bank got $4.85B in taxpayer bailouts after the financial crisis. It’s recovered pretty well. It controls $206B in assets and has a MLB stadium named after it. But the #BankLobbyistAct could regulate @Suntrust as if it were a small community bank.

7. Amend Section 301 of the #BankLobbyistAct to include the FREE Act – which I introduced after the #EquifaxBreach to allow Americans to freeze their credit files without paying fees to the credit reporting agencies. https://t.co/J2HTvCGCVE
6. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks from this bill from merging or acquiring another bank for 5 years. Loosening the rules on these big banks will lead to more consolidation in the banking industry unless Congress prohibits it. https://t.co/nnjTTQcpt0
5. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent banks that receive regulatory rollbacks as a result of this bill from buying back stock for 5 years. Why would we loosen the rules on big banks just so they can shower more money on wealthy shareholders and executives? https://t.co/aGVTMg47qM
4. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that have outsourced more than 50 jobs in the last 5 years. Congress should reward keeping jobs here at home – not do favors for banks that move jobs overseas. https://t.co/ML8oA7ei5e
3. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that were fined over $10 million by regulators in the last 10 years. These banks have caused enough damage already – think of the harm they could do with even fewer rules. https://t.co/rzkk7EXMDg
2. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks that are under Justice Department supervision after being busted for breaking the law. They broke the rules already – they shouldn't be rewarded with less oversight. https://t.co/P95w6VPlzi
1. Amend the #BankLobbyistAct to prevent rolling back rules on banks      that received over $1 billion in taxpayer bailouts during the 2008 crisis. They already wrecked our economy once – we can't let them do it again. https://t.co/D8Ah69cBad

Senate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn’t be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again. https://t.co/bfkEgNdl9C

Today, 13 big banks wrote a sweet thank you note to the Republicans – and Democrats – who support the #BankLobbyistAct. These banks got $30B in bailouts just a few years ago, but they are still able to get Senators of both parties to do their bidding and roll back the rules. https://t.co/M2bMtkoU7r

In her last act as Fed Chair, Janet Yellen took significant steps to hold @WellsFargo accountable for its fake accounts scam.

We’ve been down this road before. Whenever things are going ok in the financial system, the lobbyists flood the halls of Congress &amp; convince politicians to roll back the rules – because what could possibly go wrong? https://t.co/7rUKIajJ8Q
The #BankLobbyistAct takes 25 of the 40 biggest banks in the country off the watch list for more federal oversight. It weakens consumer protections on mortgages – and makes it harder to fight racial discrimination in housing. https://t.co/69zXffiLFt
The Senate – with the support of some Democrats – is set to start debate on a bill to roll back regulations on the same big banks we bailed out a few years ago. If we lose the final vote next week, we’ll be paving the way for the next big crash. https://t.co/i7HO3AvNJ9

.@Equifax can’t be trusted. Their mistakes allowed the breach to happen, their response has been a failure, and they still can’t level with the public. Enough is enough. We have to start holding the credit reporting industry accountable. https://t.co/p9oKVLqyHb

Today, #SCOTUS heard arguments in Janus v. AFSCME. I know which side I’m on in this case – standing with teachers, nurses, firefighters, &amp; workers who want to #UnrigtheSystem &amp; join together to fight for higher wages, better benefits, &amp; retirement security:https://t.co/MgoYaU05VZ
I’ve pressed the @NLRB for months about William Emanuel’s conflicts of interest, and the Inspector General is now investigating. Today, I asked the board to reconsider their decision, and they just said they will: https://t.co/MX5WWl56oH
William Emanuel’s list of potential conflicts of interest is a mile long – and he was the key vote in a recent @NLRB decision that could allow big companies (including those represented by his former employer) to shirk their responsibilities to employees. https://t.co/GXuZF0h4bc
The @NLRB is supposed to protect the rights of workers to organize and fight for better wages. But the GOP has stacked its board with anti-worker, big money insiders – including William Emanuel, who used to represent big companies in cases against workers.
On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear Janus v. AFSCME – the latest case in a years-long assault by powerful right-wing billionaires against workers. If AFSCME loses, so will nurses, teachers, police, and firefighters all across our country. #UnrigtheSystem https://t.co/4GoGyK3Abo

American consumers deserve a straight answer, so today I asked @MickMulvaneyOMB again: Why are you using the @CFPB to prop up payday lenders? https://t.co/XqBj00N4F5

The more you look at the details of the #EquifaxBreach, the worse it gets. Congress needs to pass the bill I introduced with @MarkWarner to impose tough penalties on credit bureaus like @Equifax when they compromise our data. https://t.co/jwdUD3w2CP
According to its own policies, @Equifax was supposed to let people know if their info was hacked. But they only notified 2.5 million. Everyone else had to go to a website that was easily spoofed and put people's data in even greater danger. #EquifaxBreach https://t.co/cBR9c5NsRX
Despite its many security failures, @Equifax used a loophole to get a big contract from the IRS after the breach. It then raised its prices – cheating American taxpayers out of millions of dollars. #EquifaxBreach https://t.co/xupIwcWe8g

The massive fraud at Wells Fargo showed the whole country that we need more accountability on Wall Street. But for more than a year, we've watched as @realDonaldTrump and his government have raced to turn the big banks loose again to once again threaten our whole economy.
Chair Yellen’s decision today to freeze the growth of Wells Fargo until it shapes up also demonstrates that we have the tools to rein in Wall Street – if our regulators have the guts to use them. This one hits them where it hurts.
Fines alone will never rein in fraudulent behavior at the big banks. We need tough penalties that affect the actual lives of the people who run the banks. By pushing out Board Members at Wells Fargo, Chair Yellen sent a strong message.  https://t.co/k5StPPvKRp

We’re still defending women’s reproductive rights 45 years after #RoevWade. Why? Because politicians who’ve never been pregnant and had to make these gut-wrenching decisions want to score political points at the expense of women and their families.

I was in #PuertoRico today with the MA delegation to see what can be done to help recovery efforts. It was clear that the road to recovery is long &amp; we're not moving fast enough. US citizens are suffering. We must do more to help, and we need to do it now. https://t.co/2KfKEqLVrN
@realDonaldTrump Eight years ago today, Joe Freddy Francois was a child in Haiti when the earthquake hit. Six years later he graduated as high school valedictorian. The character of this nation is not the character of its president. It is the character of its people.	https://t.co/g9c0FISdRe
I could call @realDonaldTrump’s comments racist, vile and disgusting because that is what they are. But I also want to tell you about Joe Freddy Francois because immigrants from Haiti, Africa and everywhere else are an integral part of the American fabric.
I’m fighting for Washington to work better for our veterans and all working families. Let’s pass the Protecting Veterans from Predatory Lending Act and give our vets more financial security.
@SenThomTillis Right now, some shady lenders can pocket huge fees by pushing veterans to refinance their VA mortgages - even when the vets end up losing money on the deal. Our bill puts a stop to that.
I’m glad to partner with @SenThomTillis on a new bipartisan bill to crack down on lenders who are trying to exploit our veterans. https://t.co/jZ6uMEdrxR
@realDonaldTrump Responsible nations stick to their agreements – and @realDonaldTrump should stick to the #IranDeal to keep our country safe.
@realDonaldTrump The Iranian regime supports terror, abuses human rights, &amp; develops ballistic missiles. The worst thing we could do is make it easier for Iran to get its hands on a nuclear weapon.
@realDonaldTrump This week, @realdonaldtrump faces a choice: keep the #IranDeal intact, or re-impose nuclear sanctions that would violate the agreement and make it easier for Iran to get a nuclear bomb.
Since 2015, the #IranDeal has blocked Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb. So far, the deal is working. But @realdonaldtrump’s refusal to recertify it could change that.

@USChamber Here’s the basic problem in Washington. Big business lobbyists are so used to running the place that they label anyone willing to stand up to them as extreme. When Tom Donohue and the @USChamber attack me for standing up to corporate interests, I know I’m doing my job.
Earlier today I introduced a bill to hold big companies like Equifax accountable to consumers.  Then millionaire lobbyist Tom Donohue who runs the @USChamber called me an extremist.

@MarkWarner @Equifax If we want @Equifax and other credit reporting agencies to act responsibly with our data, we need to hold them accountable when they screw up. https://t.co/0mZ1ZHqiHG
@MarkWarner @Equifax Had this law been in place during the Equifax breach, the company would have had to pay at least $1.5 billion in fines – half of which would have gone straight back to affected consumers. Instead, @Equifax likely made money off the hack.
Today @MarkWarner and I introduced a new bill that would impose massive, mandatory penalties when companies like @Equifax expose millions of Americans’ personal information. https://t.co/GTugkoudIw

@realDonaldTrump Congress should act now to pass the SECURE Act and provide qualified TPS  recipients with access to legal permanent residency. Many Salvadorans, Haitians &amp; Nicaraguans have lived, worked and paid taxes in the US  for decades. This is their home. We must #SaveTPS.
The Trump Admin’s use of TPS to initiate wholesale deportations is fundamentally wrong. These actions do not make America stronger or safer - they weaken our economy and our communities.
First, the Trump Admin ended Temporary Protected Status for 2,500 Nicaraguans. Then, nearly 60,000 Haitians. Today, @realdonaldtrump crossed another item off his anti-immigrant agenda by terminating TPS for 200,000 Salvadorans.
Dreamers aren’t bargaining chips. They aren’t pawns in @realDonaldTrump’s game. We made a promise. We said come out of the shadows &amp; be fully woven into the fabric of America because that’s who you are. In America, we work hard &amp; dream big &amp; we must keep our promise to Dreamers.
Congress needs to take immediate action to protect state marijuana laws, and the patients that rely on them.
@TheJusticeDept's reckless decision to rescind its policy allowing states to enforce their own drug policies puts our public health and safety at risk.

Sooner or later, a reckoning is coming. And I will promise you this: When it does, the politicians who lead this Congress &amp; voted for this tax heist will be held accountable for turning their backs on the American people.
Americans are angry. And they are right to be angry. Over &amp; over, again &amp; again, they watch this Congress ignore their problems while jumping to do more favors for billionaires, giant companies, &amp; campaign donors.
The bill that the Republicans jammed through the Senate tonight isn’t tax reform. It’s a heist. Let's call this out for what it is: Government for sale. #GOPTaxScam
Tonight I told the @SenateGOP who are ramming through their #GOPTaxScam: It’s a terrible day for millions of working families in this country who just want Congress to work for them. https://t.co/801O1iqUxN

No, there isn’t “plenty of time” to pass the Dream Act. 30,000 Dreamers will lose their legal status each month. The Dreamers I just spoke with outside the Capitol can’t wait any longer for Congress to keep its promise. We need the #DreamActNow. https://t.co/2rX4wog12N
I’m ready to vote on a clean #DreamActNow. So are many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. A majority of Americans support this bipartisan bill. So what the heck are you waiting for, @SenateMajLdr? Let’s do this RIGHT NOW.
@HouseGOP Big banks sucked down almost $70B in taxpayer bailouts just a few years ago – and now the @HouseGOP want to turn them loose all over again. No Democrat that claims to support working families should join the GOP in supporting this bill. https://t.co/ds2ryUjBSN

We need to fight for judges that protect the rights of all Americans, not just the wealthy &amp; the well-connected. That’s why I will be voting against these judicial nominees, &amp; I urge my colleagues to do the same.
This week, the GOP Senate will vote on Steven Grasz, Donny Willett, &amp; James Ho to sit on the federal courts of appeals. The records of all 3 nominees show that they will favor powerful interests over workers, women, LGBTQ individuals, people of color, &amp; religious minorities.
Now that there’s a GOP President who’s committed to tilting our courts further in favor of the rich &amp; the powerful, Republicans are looking to fill our courts with judges who share that commitment.
For years, the GOP have worked hand-in-hand with billionaire-funded right-wing groups to ensure that our courts advance the interests of the wealthy &amp; powerful over those of everybody else.
Are you really trying to bully, intimidate and slut-shame @SenGillibrand? Do you know who you're picking a fight with? Good luck with that, @realDonaldTrump. Nevertheless, #shepersisted. https://t.co/mYJtBZfxiu
The American people deserve to know how this #GOPTaxScam will impact the economy and how it will affect middle-class families. @USTreasury promised an economic analysis – but this isn’t it. I look forward to the IG’s investigation providing real answers for American families.
To recap: After claiming repeatedly he had projections showing the #GOPTaxScam paid for itself, Mnuchin released a report showing that there were no such projections, and that even his own wildly optimistic made-up projections weren’t enough for the plan to pay for itself.
Where does the other half of the growth come from according to @USTreasury? Partly from proposals that haven’t even been introduced in Congress and may never happen. https://t.co/aZpZlfdcgX
But it’s worse: even Mnuchin’s made-up numbers on the corporate tax changes only get Republicans halfway to the economic growth numbers they’re claiming.
Mnuchin’s projection is completely out of line with other projections. It's way higher than credible estimates, and even higher than right-wing projections that ignore the effect of the national debt on growth. https://t.co/7C6KCIWwOB
In other words: @USTreasury’s OTP couldn’t support Mnuchin’s claims about economic growth, so he just said it again without evidence.
While @USTreasury’s OTP made other projections in this report, it didn’t make the key projection that growth would go up about .35% annually thanks to the corporate tax changes in the GOP tax bill.
A bit of important background on this claim. @USTreasury includes the Office of Tax Policy (OTP). The OTP is staffed by non-political tax experts and economists, who are responsible for projecting the economic impact of changes to the tax code.
But how does the report show that economic growth WILL be 2.9% instead of 2.2% thanks to the GOP tax plan? It doesn’t! Instead, @USTreasury "expects approximately half" of this additional growth to come from corporate tax changes. https://t.co/Vv6MGNCH9j
@USTreasury The @USTreasury report says that IF economic growth is 2.9% instead of 2.2% over the next ten years, then the national debt will go down despite the GOP plan’s massive tax giveaway to big corporations. Oh really?
In this bogus report, @USTreasury was supposed to use its economic models to project how the GOP tax plan would affect economic growth.	 	It didn't do that. It just made up the numbers.
After I requested an investigation, @USTreasury finally released its "analysis" of the #GOPTaxScam. This one-page report is pathetic – and shows Secretary Mnuchin has no basis for claiming that the tax plan "will pay for itself with growth." https://t.co/3KjogQLeHE https://t.co/ZmcwxSkcQN

Just offered amendment #60, which prohibits deregulation under the #BankLobbyistsAct for financial institutions that have fired or retaliated against whistleblowers.
Amendment #52 which stops deregulation of banks under consent decree or a deferred prosecution agreement failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct
Just offered amendment #52, which stops banks that break the law &amp; agree to a consent order or deferred prosecution agreement from getting deregulated under the #BankLobbyistsAct. Banks that break the law need more supervision, not less.
Amendment #49 to prohibit deregulated banks from merging with other banks for 5 years failed, 5-18. Six Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct
Amendment #47 to require bank execs to certify their banks aren’t breaking the law failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct
Just offered amendment #49, which prohibits any bank deregulated under the #BankLobbyistsAct from merging with another bank for 5 years. If this bill is truly about helping community banks, let’s stop big banks from gobbling up other banks.
Just offered amendment #47, which requires big bank execs that want to be deregulated under the #BankLobbyistsAct to sign an annual certificate that they’ve done due diligence &amp; certify that there’s no criminal conduct or civil fraud happening at their bank.
Amendment #44 to require public votes on million dollar settlements failed, 8-15. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct

Amendment #40 on the financial exploitation of seniors failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct
Just offered amendment #40, dealing with financial exploitation of seniors. The immunity provisions in the #BankLobbyistsAct are too broad. This helps financial firms report the exploitation of seniors without also letting banks off the hook for unrelated consumer violations.
Amendment #39 on the FREE Act failed, 7-16. Four Democrats voted with the Republicans against it. #BankLobbyistsAct

This Congress doesn’t work for working families. It works for corporate lobbyists &amp; campaign donors in backroom deals &amp; 1:30 AM votes. This corruption is hollowing out America’s middle class &amp; tearing down our democracy.

Flynn’s admission underscores the importance of the Special Prosecutor. No one is above the law – NO ONE. The American people deserve to know the truth.
President Trump’s National Security Advisor pled guilty to a federal crime relating to his contacts with the Russian Government. This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a serious threat to the national security of the United States.
We can build an America where every kid has a shot at success. Where every family has some basic measure of economic security. Where every senior has enough savings to retire with dignity. That starts by defeating this #GOPTaxScam.
I don’t think a single middle class family in this country should pay more taxes so that big corporations &amp; billionaires can pay less. Big corporations should pay MORE so that we can cut taxes on working families &amp; small businesses &amp; invest in our future. #GOPTaxScam
The #GOPTaxScam is a smash-and-grab job. The GOP don’t even try to hide the corruption. And they don’t worry about how many middle class families are hurt in the caper.
This #GOPTaxScam is about paying off the rich, corporate donors that helped get the @SenateGOP elected. It’s about the way money has corrupted Washington: millions in campaign contributions for billions in tax giveaways.
The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about fiscal responsibility. For years, the GOP have whined about exploding debt. If this trillion-dollar #GOPTaxScam passes, the @SenateGOP will turn around next week &amp; say – sorry! There’s no money for Medicare, Medicaid, education, housing, you name it.
The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about economic growth or jobs. Trickle down doesn’t work. But don’t take my word for it: top execs have admitted that they’ll use tax giveaways to buy back stock &amp; fund new mergers. Nothing for workers.
The #GOPTaxScam isn’t about helping working people. It RAISES taxes for millions of middle class families. The @SenateGOP had their chance to vote to make middle class tax cuts permanent this afternoon. They voted NO.

The only thing that will turn the @CFPB into a disaster is for @realDonaldTrump to ignore Dodd-Frank &amp; name an acting director determined to destroy the agency.
The @CFPB has returned $12 billion to working families who were cheated. That’s government that works for the people, @realDonaldTrump.
Less than a decade after taxpayers bailed out the big banks, the banking industry made record profits last year. That's who you're worried about, @realDonaldTrump? https://t.co/O318bHhZbS
If @realDonaldTrump believes he is acting legally by ignoring Dodd-Frank, he should go to court &amp; seek a judgment right away to settle this @CFPB dispute.

Bank lawyer Alan Kaplinsky &amp; I often disagree. But we agree that there is an "enormous cloud of uncertainty" over @realDonaldTrump naming Mulvaney acting @CFPB Director. https://t.co/uPiDuRdgtl
.@realDonaldTrump can nominate the next @CFPB Director - but until that nominee is confirmed by the Senate, Leandra English is the Acting Director under the Dodd-Frank Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can’t override that. https://t.co/r949ccaJAb

The new Director of the @CFPB must be someone with a track record of protecting consumers &amp; holding financial firms responsible when they cheat people. This is no place for another Trump-appointed industry hack.
At the @CFPB, Rich Cordray forced the biggest financial institutions to return $12B directly to the people they cheated. He held big banks accountable. He's a dedicated public servant &amp; a tireless watchdog for US consumers – &amp; he will be missed.

This is important. @realDonaldTrump has cited the death count to argue his disaster response to Puerto Rico was top notch. It appears many hurricane deaths are going uncounted. Each day that passes makes it tougher to figure out the true total.

The fight to save heath care isn't over. Sound the alarm. We need you to fight today &amp; every day until this @SenateGOP bill is dead.
Let me repeat: The Graham-Cassidy @SenateGOP "health care" bill IS Trumpcare, &amp; it will rip health care away from millions of Americans.
Coverage ripped away from tens of millions of Americans with Graham-Cassidy – kids with disabilities, grandparents in nursing homes.
Graham-Cassidy completely eliminates help for families to buy health insurance. Gone. Good luck on your own.
The @SenateGOP Graham-Cassidy "health care" bill cuts Medicaid funding &amp; rolls back protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
There's nothing new &amp; improved about the Graham-Cassidy bill – it's the same cruel @SenateGOP "health care" bill, but on steroids.
The @SenateGOP have a big 9/30 deadline to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And here's the scary thing: they might have the votes to do it.

On top of these bills, I launched an investigation into the @Equifax breach &amp; credit reporting industry in general. https://t.co/VLssJGpmC6
Bad credit doesn’t make you a bad employee. Workers should compete on the merits, not on their credit scores.
Credit reports are already riddled with errors. The @Equifax hack will make it worse. Inaccurate reports shouldn't hurt your job chances.
I also reintroduced the Equal Employment for All Act to prevent employers from asking job applicants for their credit histories. https://t.co/dYO2PXEPWs
The idea behind our bill is simple: @Equifax doesn't pay you when they sell your data. You shouldn't have to pay them to stop selling it.
The FREE Act lets you freeze – and unfreeze – access to your credit file at no cost. It's like a free Do Not Call list for your credit data.
Companies like @Equifax make billions selling access to your data without your consent, then charge you if you want to stop them. It's nuts.
I introduced the Freedom from Equifax Exploitation (FREE) Act with @brianschatz. Our bill gives you more control of your data. https://t.co/l5pboE0t4q
Lot of people are outraged about the @Equifax data breach. I am too. Here’s what I’ve been doing about it this week.
Today I told an @AnthemInc VP: If they want to make huge profits off taxpayers, they ought to provide decent coverage through the ACA. https://t.co/i6KU8bRKg2
More than half of @AnthemInc's revenue comes from programs like Medicare &amp; Medicaid. But they're abandoning people in ACA exchanges.
Insurance giant @AnthemInc sent Congress a ransom note: bigger tax cuts, or they’d pull out of more state health care exchanges.
When the GOP tried to repeal the ACA, some – like @BCBSMA – fought for their customers. But not @AnthemInc.

“Skinny repeal” is reckless, cruel &amp; immoral. If the @SenateGOP pass this bill, they'll show they just don’t care about American families.
Only in the GOP alternative upside down reality can you hate a bill so much that you’re going to vote for it.
Here’s what you learn in “How to be a Senator 101”: If you support a bill, you vote yes. If you don’t, you vote no.
Mark my words: If the GOP can’t get a deal in committee that destroys the ACA even more, “skinny repeal” will become the law of the land.
If the @SenateGOP wanted a bill they could fix in committee, it could’ve been blank piece of paper. They CHOSE to intro this malicious bill.
And here’s the worst part: The @SenateGOP knows this bill is appalling. One senator called it “a disaster.” “The dumbest thing in history.”
CBO says this latest garbage bill will lead to 16 MILLION more uninsured. https://t.co/huOjkQsfha
This @SenateGOP bill they’re voting on tonight kills a part of the ACA key to keeping insurance affordable for everyone.
From what I can tell, “skinny repeal” just means gutting important parts of the Affordable Care Act.
So here’s the deal: In the dead of night tonight, the @SenateGOP will try to pass a “skinny repeal” of health care.
The @SenateGOP “skinny bill” is here and it’s exactly as wretched as we thought it’d be. https://t.co/nRxBnQloQB
"C’mon, @SenateGOP. Pass a terrible 'skinny repeal' of health care &amp; we'll 'fix it' in committee!” ?!? https://t.co/fv5Uc9lro1
Health care for millions of Americans hangs in the balance and it will all unfold tonight. Here’s what’s happening: https://t.co/gF4A42GxBq
The American people don’t think that guaranteed health care is a joke. I look forward to the @SenateGOP learning that lesson.
The @SenateGOP thinks guaranteed health care is all a big joke. They’re using it as a cynical ploy to play political football.
.@SenSanders is correct: Health care is a right, not a privilege. We have a moral obligation to make sure everyone has access to it.
None of this needs to happen, and I hope it doesn’t. https://t.co/4LsASr4es2
We won't let the @SenateGOP pass a bill that defunds Planned Parenthood and strips women's access to basic medical care. We will fight back. https://t.co/QCkqcp76Oq
"Skinny repeal" should be called "gut it and run." Voting to destroy insurance markets and kick millions off health care remains immoral. https://t.co/D8N1Jlk6tD
If the Senate passes "skinny repeal" then the @GOP will go into a back room to "compromise" between 15M and 23M people losing health care.
And "skinny repeal" would likely result in at least 15 MILLION people losing health insurance. https://t.co/v40pO3cQua
If the Senate passes "skinny repeal" – which guts the marketplace – premiums will skyrocket. Insurers will quit.
Senators can hide their final health care bill from the public, but they can't hide from the consequences of their votes.
.@SenateDems will vote to protect Planned Parenthood – and we will vote down this terrible proposal.
These next votes are on “repeal and run” of the Affordable Care Act – with a ban on Planned Parenthood funding thrown in for kicks.
This morning @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s second attempt at ripping health care away from millions of people.
.@realDonaldTrump can pretend this is a military decision, but it isn't. Banning troops on gender identity is shameful &amp; makes us less safe.
By attacking thousands of troops, @realDonaldTrump makes clear that he cares more about extreme ideology than military readiness.
The only thing – only thing – that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job.
This vote will be the first of many @SenateGOP failures. We're doing everything we can to defend the health care of millions of Americans.
In addition to being cruel, this first @SenateGOP proposal violates the Budget Act, so it needs 60 votes. It won't get them.
Tonight @SenateDems will vote to kill @SenateMajLdr McConnell’s first attempt at ripping health care away from millions.

We must have the @CFPB's back as Wall St's buddies in Congress try to roll back the rules. But today: we celebrate. Happy Birthday, @CFPB!
The big banks have been against the @CFPB from day one, and their armies of lobbyists are doing all they can to weaken this agency.
For 6 years, the @CFPB has had 1 mission: to take tricks &amp; traps out of financial products like credit cards and hold cheaters accountable.
Today is a special day. It’s the 6th birthday of the @CFPB – or, as I like to call it, the Little Agency That Could. https://t.co/TplGMEGlpJ

People in MA &amp; across this country spoke out against this terrible "healthcare" bill. Today, you proved that you made your voices heard.
I’m deeply relieved that @SenateMajLdr delayed a vote on the @SenateGOP's bill to rip health care away from 22 million Americans.

This is a tax cut bill paid for by stealing billions from working people &amp; destroying health care for millions. Time to start over.
A bill that is opposed by the @AmerMedicalAssn because it will literally harm millions is not a "health care" bill.
A bill that kicks 22 million people off insurance to deliver $569 billion in tax giveaways to rich people is not a "health care" bill.

There’s a reason the @SenateGOP don’t want you to see their mean healthcare bill: they know it will hurt real people.
Gutting funding for babies’ healthcare or seniors’ nursing homes is mean. Letting insurance companies drop cancer survivors is mean.
But @realDonaldTrump is right: The GOP healthcare bill IS mean. Cutting healthcare for 23M people to give billionaires a tax break is mean.
Of all the words that @realDonaldTrump could pick, Trump called his healthcare plan “mean.” Mean for hard-working Americans.
There are a lot of words that a President could use to describe their healthcare plan. Effective. Efficient. Comprehensive. Compassionate.

As our top law enforcement officer, the AG must be truthful and uphold the law. Sessions cannot continue to serve. He should resign.
If AG Sessions were truly recused, he should have had nothing to do with firing Comey. He promised to recuse. He broke that promise.
Today before Congress, AG Sessions refused to answer key questions about his discussions with @realDonaldTrump related to Comey’s firing.
And now there’s talk that the Special Counsel now running the Russia investigation may be next on the chopping block. That’s bananas.
But even after recusing himself, Sessions recommended that the President fire FBI Director Comey – who was leading the Russia investigation.
AG Sessions was forced to recuse himself from the Russia investigation after he lied to Congress about multiple meetings with the Russians.

Let me repeat: The @HouseGOP voted today to make it nearly impossible to hold big banks accountable for cheating you. #WrongChoiceAct
While everyone was watching Comey today, the @HouseGOP just voted to gut the rules on Wall Street. #WrongChoiceAct
A hostile foreign gov used a dangerous weapon to undermine our democracy. We must set aside politics &amp; make certain it never happens again.
No matter who @realDonaldTrump threatens, intimidates, or fires, it’s the job of law enforcement &amp; Congress to get to the bottom of this.
Comey’s sworn testimony today paints a picture of a President only interested in protecting himself, his aides, &amp; his friends from the law.
The first job of the President of the United States – the first job – is to protect this nation from threats.
There’s no question this is a powerfully important moment for the Senate, the Trump-Russia investigation, our rule of law, &amp; our democracy.

The recent Trump-DeVos education budget upends the student loan program &amp; makes it harder to afford college.
But so far what has @BetsyDeVosED done? She’s hired advisers tied to shady for-profit colleges &amp; made it easier to cheat students.
As Education Secretary, @BetsyDeVosED controls the $1T student loan program – a massive responsibility.
Selling out to these corporations might be @realDonaldTrump’s style, but we must do better as a nation and tackle climate change head-on.

Trumpcare is devastating for the poor. Seniors. Pregnant women. People w/ pre-existing conditions, mental health &amp; substance use disorders.

Under Trumpcare, 445k MA residents would lose healthcare. We’d lose $10B in state funding. And out-of-pocket costs would skyrocket.
A new analysis out today shows: Trumpcare will hit Massachusetts like a sledgehammer. https://t.co/f03ZTPOpA1
When we fight, we can win. I’m going to keep on fighting any attempts to weaken, undermine, or kill the @USDOL conflict of interest rule.
@BarackObama @USDOL We can’t let our guard down. The Trump Admin &amp; giant financial firms made it clear: they'll try to roll back this rule as soon as they can.
@BarackObama @USDOL Good news: We put a stop to the predatory conflicts of interest that cost Americans saving for retirement $17B/yr. https://t.co/Dr1trMUM48

@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury Watch this totally bizarre testimony from @USTreasury Sec Mnuchin where he admits he doesn’t support Glass-Steagall. https://t.co/pFTMnqf82m
@realDonaldTrump Now that @realDonaldTrump &amp; @USTreasury Sec Mnuchin have met with the Wall Street lobbyists, they’ve done a complete 180 on Glass-Steagall.
.@realDonaldTrump has claimed for months that he supports reinstating Glass-Steagall - the law separating commercial &amp; investment banking.
As Mueller steps up to enforce the law, Congress must step up too – with its own independent, bipartisan, &amp; transparent investigations.
For Mr. Mueller to succeed, he needs total authority to pursue this investigation – completely free of any hint of political interference.
It is obvious to the American people that the Russia-Trump investigation requires a special counsel, &amp; I am glad we finally have one.

AG Sessions didn’t just decide to recuse himself because he’s a nice guy. @TheJusticeDept regulations require it.
Sessions played a role in firing FBI Director Comey – a firing @realDonaldTrump said was, in part, based on Comey’s Russia investigation.
After getting caught lying about contact with the Russians, Sessions said he’d recused himself from the Trump-Russia investigation.

@SenatorLankford The bipartisan #TruthinSettlements Act passed unanimously through the Senate in the last Congress. It’s time to make this happen.
Today @SenatorLankford &amp; I reintroduced our #TruthinSettlements Act to shut down the backroom deal making: https://t.co/WHFVH5SgoY
Settlements may be tax deductible or have credits hidden in fine print. If the gov is going to cut deals, we should know what we’re getting.
When the federal gov reaches a settlement with companies that break the law, they tout a big $ amount. But those numbers can be misleading.
Wishing all my best for a speedy recovery to my dear friend @maziehirono. Your Senate family is here for you every step of the way!

It’s time for Congress to get their heads out of the sand. @realDonaldTrump cannot pick the person to continue this critical investigation.
But does anyone seriously believe @realDonaldTrump fired the top person investigating his ties to Russia because he was unfair to Hillary?
There’s no question that Comey made questionable decisions during the election. The FBI shouldn’t comment on ongoing investigations.

If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to help Syrians fleeing murderers, he should drop his effort to ban their children from America immediately.
Congress must demand an actual strategy, clear goals, and a plan for achieving them before approving additional military action in Syria.
The President's erratic approach to Syria is not a strategy. It underscores why our Constitution doesn't let Presidents wage war alone.
Within a week, Trump's Admin went from asserting they wouldn't intervene to launching Tomahawk missiles against Assad. That's erratic.
We need a plan to hold Assad accountable. But so far I’ve seen no compelling strategic justification for Trump's missile strike.

If bankers want to go gamble with complex financial products, ok – but they shouldn’t do it with the money in grandma’s checking account.
But let’s get real: Most of the big banks are even bigger now than when we declared them “too big to fail” in 2008 &amp; bailed them out.
We’ve made some real progress since Wall Street’s high-risk bets brought our economy to its knees.
If ever we needed a strong, independent Supreme Court with broad public support, it’s now. Rules change or not, we’ll keep fighting for it.
The GOP will be responsible for every 5-4 decision that throws working Americans under the bus to favor the powerful, moneyed few.

Changing the rules to jam through a right-wing, corporate-owned judge means the GOP will have to own the Gorsuch Court.

Today is a great day for the people of Massachusetts &amp; people across the country who depend on the Affordable Care Act.
The truth will come out, @GOP. Get on the right side of history before it's too late.
The idea that Devin Nunes will investigate Trump/Russia is a farce. It's time for a real, independent, transparent inquiry.
The FBI is investigating collusion between @realDonaldTrump's campaign &amp; Russia. When will the GOP end the charade &amp; put country first?
Meanwhile, reports today say @realDonaldTrump's campaign manager was paid millions to help Putin influence US politics. Drip. Drip. Drip.
After slamming leaks as "criminal," Devin Nunes is now privately briefing @realDonaldTrump - even leaking info to help him.
Who does House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes think he works for: the American people or @realDonaldTrump?

I've strongly opposed the Gorsuch nomination. Giant companies don't need another Supreme Court justice to tilt the law in their favor.
Neil Gorsuch is up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court from a President whose campaign is under FBI investigation.
Instead of siding with the big banks, the @HouseGOP should join @HouseDemocrats in ensuring that the @CFPB remains a strong cop on the beat.
Today, the GOP @FinancialCmte has a hearing about “restructuring” the @CFPB – another way of saying they want to weaken it.
The @CFPB is widely popular with the American people – and widely hated by the big Wall Street banks it regulates.
The @CFPB is a tough watchdog for working families, forcing big banks to return more than $12B to people they cheated.
Transparency, pressure &amp; activism work. But we’re going to need a whole lot more of it to make @usedgov work for students.
The DeVos aide who resigned last week? His dad happened to run the student loan company that sued @usedgov about that pro-borrower policy.
The damage has already been done. @usedgov announced it would let student loan companies charge some struggling students outrageous fees.
The same day I wrote to DeVos about her aides’ obvious conflicts, one of them apparently resigned. https://t.co/KIw0enbJ8O

Consider what #Trumpcare will do to families &amp; communities struggling with the opioid crisis. We already have an opioid treatment gap.
There's no other way to say it: #Trumpcare is just part of a GOP plan to help the rich get richer &amp; kick dirt in everyone else's face.
Who thinks the central problem in America is that middle class families have too much health care &amp; rich people need more gov handouts?
What kind of health care bill has as its central feature ripping insurance away from tens of millions of American citizens?
About to speak about the devastating impact that #Trumpcare will have on fighting the opioid crisis in MA. Watch: https://t.co/sHhsGuB8B5

Throwing 24 million people off their health care to give billionaires a tax break is heartless &amp; irresponsible. We cannot pass #Trumpcare.
Alan on the South Shore worries about his daughter Meg, who needs Medicaid for her disability. What about her, @realDonaldTrump? #Trumpcare
Olivia in North Reading has a chronic illness &amp; needs the ACA to stay alive. Will she be in the 24 million, @SenateMajLdr? #Trumpcare
Denise from MA has 3 cancer survivors in her family of 4. Will they be in the 24 million who lose under #Trumpcare, @SpeakerRyan?
MA residents have been writing, calling, emailing me – deeply worried about their health care. And they have every right to be worried.
The budget experts' numbers are in: the GOP #Trumpcare plan will rip health coverage away from 24 million people. https://t.co/sFNLFmNvXo

Newsflash, @realDonaldTrump: The Senate confirms US Attorneys. And you're not replacing real prosecutors with cronies w/out a massive fight.
You can't fire the rule of law, @realDonaldTrump. You can't shut down ongoing investigations by career prosecutors.
.@realDonaldTrump wants people like AG Sessions – a loyalist who lied to the Senate about meeting with the Russians – in @TheJusticeDept.
.@realDonaldTrump fired acting AG Sally Yates – who refused to defend his #MuslimBan &amp; had warned the WH about Flynn’s contact with Russia.
GOP &amp; Dems respect Preet Bharara as a fearless prosecutor who stands up to both parties &amp; Wall Street. I guess that's why Trump fired him.
Preet Bharara had authority over Trump Tower. @realDonaldTrump called him directly, breaching protocol. 24 hrs later he was asked to resign.
Weeks ago, @realDonaldTrump promised to keep Preet Bharara as the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Yesterday, Preet was fired. Why?
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about getting corruption out of gov. But he wants a bunch of tame prosecutors who won’t investigate him.
It’s time to junk this cruel #Trumpcare bill before massive numbers of Americans are hurt by it.
A health care bill that destroys care &amp; affordable coverage for millions – seriously? What planet are these guys living on?!
Republicans seem intent on plowing ahead anyway – pretending down is up, left is right, &amp; #Trumpcare is somehow not a catastrophe.
Don’t forget patient advocates like @ACSCAN &amp; @AARPadvocates – they’re appalled by #Trumpcare, too.
The GOP have convinced people who never agree on ANYTHING – docs, hospitals, economists, even insurance companies: #Trumpcare is a disaster.
Anyone who cares about access to mental health care benefits under the GOP health plan needs to watch @RepJoeKennedy’s video right now. https://t.co/Pj2bQQrGHw

I’m heading to the Senate floor now to speak out against GOP’s plan to repeal the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order: https://t.co/dzZQbTR3Rg
There’s a lot we could be doing to help US workers. Instead, the GOP wants to make it easier for giant gov contractors to hurt workers.
Today’s debate on the Fair Pay &amp; Safe Workplaces order is about who Congress works for. I’m here to fight for workers – &amp; I’ll be voting no.
Instead of helping workers, the GOP will vote today to make it easier for companies that hurt workers to get massive gov contracts.
My office released a report today that shows 2/3 of the top contractors have been caught breaking labor laws. https://t.co/AOed3xBPYa
The US gov pays billions to federal contractors – but some of the biggest corporations underpay workers &amp; put their health/safety at risk.

When we’re #fightingforfamilies loud enough person-to-person, city-to-city, state-to-state, then DC can’t ignore these issues any longer.
And while the GOP continues to block #equalpay for equal work, state lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies.
Businesses that cheat their workers must be held accountable. State lawmakers are #fightingforfamilies with bills to stop wage theft.
A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. State lawmakers across the country are #fightingforfamilies with bills to expand overtime.
And Massachusetts continues to lead the way in #fightingforfamilies with earned sick time &amp; the highest state minimum wage in the country.
Massachusetts has shown that #fightingforfamilies can start in states. We did it with marriage equality &amp; health care reform.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP leadership aren’t #fightingforfamilies with policies like raising the min wage, overtime pay or fair scheduling.
And we need Attorney General Jeff Sessions – who should have never been confirmed in the first place – to resign. We need it now.
We need a special prosecutor totally independent of the AG. We need a real, bipartisan, transparent Congressional investigation into Russia.
This is not normal. This is not fake news. This is a very real &amp; serious threat to the national security of the United States.
Now Jeff Sessions is AG – the final say on the law enforcement investigation into ties between the Trump campaign &amp; Russia? What a farce.
Jeff Sessions answered “No.” Turns out he met with the Russian Ambassador. Two months before the election.
It's a simple q: "Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election?"

For any and all these reasons, today I urged my colleagues to vote NO on Wilbur Ross for @CommerceGov. https://t.co/n5KKjRI5ps
Wilbur Ross has shady ties to Russia, serious business conflicts, &amp; a history of cheating people out of their homes.
.@CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself.
.@SenMarkey &amp; I wrote to 17 agencies about whether they’ll use Trump’s order to cut off funding for MA services. https://t.co/fPboLE9Pqu
MA pays more in taxes than we get back in federal funds. But that money is at risk because of @realDonaldTrump’s order on local immigrants.

Every R who opposes extending debate today is responsible for whatever it turns out is in Pruitt's emails next week. Make the right choice.
Considering how obsessed @GOP are with emails, I'd hope they'd vote to extend debate on Pruitt until we can see his secret Big Oil ones.
.@SenateGOP are jamming through Pruitt at @EPA before his emails come out. At 12:30pm, @SenateDems will force a vote to extend the debate.
.@EPA nominee Scott Pruitt wouldn't provide his office's records of dealings with Big Oil, so a court ruled he must release them next week.
I’m speaking on the Senate floor now to strong oppose Scott Pruitt to run the @EPA. Watch: https://t.co/mWLpJbotzx
In the choice between corporate polluters &amp; people who want to breathe the air &amp; drink the water, Scott Pruitt sides with the polluters.
Those emails might show corruption - so of course Republicans are jamming his confirmation through 4 days before the emails become public.
A few hours ago, a judge in OK ordered the release of thousands of emails on @EPA nominee Scott Pruitt's relationship with Big Oil.

.@realDonaldTrump ’s nominee for @USDOL - @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees CEO Andy Puzder – has made his fortune treating workers with total contempt.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP should stop these reckless actions to hurt the ACA before they hurt even more people who need health coverage.
When you shut down ads, fewer people sign up. Now Humana is pulling out of the exchanges. They don’t have enough healthy young ppl enrolled.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP have worked around the clock to sabotage health care: A vague ACA order. Repeal &amp; run. Pull the enrollment ads.
Congress must pull its head out of the sand and launch a real, bipartisan, transparent inquiry into Russia. Our natl security is at stake.
When did @WhiteHouse know that Flynn lied? What other contacts with Russia occurred during the campaign? Who knew what? Who approved what?
This. Is. Not. Normal. @realDonaldTrump owes Americans a full account of his Admin’s dealings with Russia, both before &amp; after the election.
.@realDonaldTrump is still making money overseas &amp; may have financial ties to Russia. Nobody knows since he STILL won’t release his taxes.
.@StateDept Sec Rex Tillerson has close ties to Putin. @CommerceGov nominee Wilbur Ross has close financial ties to Putin buddies.
Reports say our own intel agencies have corroborated parts of a dossier alleging that Russia has compromising info about @realDonaldTrump.
This isn’t a game. Reports say the Russians conducted a series of successful cyber-attacks on our elections to help elect @realDonaldTrump.
But American national security demands that we not allow Michael Flynn to become a scapegoat for this Admin's disturbing ties to Russia.
Michael Flynn’s blinding religious hatred &amp; shady Russian ties disqualified him as NSA on day one. His removal is a win for American values.
I will be voting NO on Steve Mnuchin’s confirmation for @USTreasury tonight. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
If Wall Street threatens to blow up the economy again, does anyone seriously expect Steve Mnuchin to tell his buddies to knock it off?
Personnel is policy. Hiring Mnuchin &amp; all these @GoldmanSachs execs shows @realDonaldTrump has no interest in reducing Wall St’s influence.
.@realDonaldTrump talked a big game about Wall St - but he's hired enough @GoldmanSachs alums to open a new bank branch at the @WhiteHouse.

There’s nothing in Steve Mnuchin’s record to suggest he could stand up to Wall Street – or that he’d even want to stand up to Wall Street.
Consider this MY warning: We won’t be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist.
And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions’s radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too.
If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism &amp; bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us.
If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us.
There’s no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly &amp; clearly: This is just the beginning.
Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have.
Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully &amp; fairly enforce the law.
I’m deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight.

After literally standing next to Wall St CEOs, @realDonaldTrump made it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your savings.

It’s time for the Senate to stand up for the Constitution &amp; exert moral leadership. I urge my colleagues: Vote NO on Jeff Sessions for AG.
Jeff Sessions is so dangerous that a Republican-controlled Senate rejected his nomination to a federal judgeship 30 years ago.
Trump expects us to replace the AG w/ Jeff Sessions, whose career is defined by hostility to civil rights, immigrants &amp; the rule of law.
Let me repeat: the @POTUS fired the nation’s top law enforcement officer for refusing to defend an illegal, unconstitutional, immoral order.
Last night, the acting AG refused to defend @realDonaldTrump’s unlawful &amp; unconstitutional Muslim ban, so Trump fired her.
Watch live now as I speak out from the Senate floor about @realDonaldTrump's Muslim ban: https://t.co/KYG7aJim5s #NoBanNoWall

I urge my colleagues: vote NO on Steve Mnuchin. Don’t put the fates of the families you represent in the hands of a lying Wall St insider.
Steve Mnuchin won't give us an honest answer about his foreclosure record. He's not going to give us one when we give him our economy.
If Steve Mnuchin were the Captain of the Titanic, he’d deny ever hitting the iceberg.
You have to wonder, @SenateDems &amp; @SenateGOP: What else is Steve Mnuchin willing to lie about if we hand him the keys to @USTreasury?
Mnuchin lied about his bank’s illegal tactics in response to @SenBobCasey's q's. There’s no other way to say it. https://t.co/lUsVQChRMd

On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember what can happen when hatred &amp; fear turns neighbor against neighbor. When we abandon those in need.
Turning our back on refugees because of their religion creates recruiting fodder for ISIS and other terrorist groups.
The Syrian refugees admitted to the US last yr are kids, doctors, teachers, engineers, &amp; college students who sought safety from terrorists.
We are a country of immigrants &amp; refugees, of people fleeing religious persecution &amp; seeking freedom, a country made strong by diversity.
.@realDonaldTrump's order restricting immigrants from Muslim countries &amp; freezing admission of refugees is a betrayal of American values.
Let’s be clear: A Muslim ban by any other name is still a Muslim ban.
Today, @realDonaldTrump closed the door on that little girl – &amp; so many others who are running for their lives.
I thought about what horrors must have possessed her parents to hand a wad of cash &amp; their little girl over to human smugglers.

And Betsy DeVos is unwilling to commit to be a cop on the beat with for-profit colleges that break the law &amp; cheat students.
Betsy DeVos repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public ed. She plans to maintain financial ties that could create conflicts of interest.
I will vote against Betsy DeVos’s nomination for @USedgov because it’s not in the best interests of America’s young people.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions today show an ugly indifference to immigrants &amp; a profound misunderstanding of the real dangers we face.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will divert local police dept resources away from protecting &amp; building trust in our communities.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will waste taxpayer dollars on irresponsible &amp; misguided pet political projects.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions will hurt working parents &amp; children who have risked their lives to flee war, violence &amp; poverty.

Attacking @PPFA &amp; US women’s reproductive rights isn’t enough for @realDonaldTrump &amp; the @GOP. Today they made their fight global.
We must measure @POTUS @realDonaldTrump by actions, not only words. And today he made it harder for families to achieve the American Dream.
That’s 40,000 families who just lost their chance to buy a home thanks to brand-new @POTUS @realDonaldTrump.

Today at 1 ET, @SenateDems are hosting a forum with ppl who’d be hurt by Price’s health care policies. Watch live: https://t.co/Q6m4FyZNmi
And yesterday at his @HHSgov hearing, Tom Price wouldn’t commit to protecting Medicare &amp; Medicaid from massive cuts. https://t.co/1NJ6dYCJK8
Rep Tom Price - @realDonaldTrump’s pick to run @HHSgov - is the lead architect of legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
When Mnuchin makes mistakes on complicated paperwork, he asks for forgiveness. When his customers made mistakes, he took their homes.
Heather McCreary lost her home when Mnuchin’s bank said she sent the wrong check with her complicated paperwork. https://t.co/k9OjA82Yfw
Steve Mnuchin told @SenStabenow &amp; @SenatorMenendez he didn’t disclose $100M because “the amount of paperwork” was tough. Boo hoo.
The people who broke our economy &amp; ruined people’s lives need to be held accountable. Not given the keys to break our economy again.
No, @SenOrrinHatch, @POTUS didn’t force Mnuchin &amp; OneWest to lie to homeowners about modifications &amp; steal homes while making millions.
.@SenPatRoberts says @RonWyden should take a valium? Maybe more Senators should be outraged by Wall St bankers that steal people's homes.
.@SenOrrinHatch said Mnuchin's bank's disgraceful actions are "essentially unrelated" to his qualifications. Tell that to his victims.
.@SenateDems held a forum to hear Mnuchin’s victims. While watching the @USTreasury hearing, remember Colleen. https://t.co/kc8ap1VIjV
.@GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear Colleen – an 84-yr-old who might lose her home because of a reverse mortgage scam from Mnuchin’s bank.
Steve Mnuchin ran a bank that lied &amp; cheated people out of their homes. @GOPSenFinance didn’t want to hear those stories today.
.@realDonaldTrump should stand with working Americans &amp; uphold @POTUS’s protections. Read my new @CNN op-ed. https://t.co/gNozaRHTU1
New protections making sure Americans are paid overtime &amp; aren’t exposed to deadly chemicals could turn to dust with @realDonaldTrump.
Paid sick days, a higher min wage, &amp; discrimination-free hiring for federal contractors could go out the window with @realDonaldTrump.
If @realDonaldTrump follows through on promises to “eliminate” or “repeal” @POTUS’s exec orders, workers could lose wages &amp; benefits Monday.
Thank you, @SenRonJohnson. Dais or not, I hope more will watch the heartbreaking stories of Mnuchin’s victims. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
If Rep Tom Price won’t commit to protecting 1 in 3 Americans’ health care, he’s not the right person to run @HHSgov.
I asked @HHSgov nominee Price: Will you follow @realDonaldTrump’s promise for no Medicare/Medicaid cuts? (Nope.) https://t.co/7pC2c4YzSl
.@HHSgov nominee Tom Price proposed a whopping $449 billion in Medicare cuts &amp; $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts as chair of @housebudgetGOP.
.@realDonaldTrump promised over &amp; over that he wouldn’t cut Medicare &amp; Medicaid, but his @HHSgov nominee won't make the same promise.
OneWest Bank victims deserve to have their voices heard, so we invited them to share their stories. Tune in now: https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
It will take a lot more than petty rearranging of furniture to stop @SenateDems from fighting for working families, @SenateGOP. Try again.
But @SenRonJohnson ordered dais chairs removed from his empty room so Senators talking to victims couldn't sit in their usual spot. Really. https://t.co/DvmGvx9WDh
3 hours before the Mnuchin victims’ forum was scheduled to start, @SenRonJohnson finally agreed that we could use his empty hearing room.
Mnuchin's allies in Congress will do ANYTHING to protect @realDonaldTrump’s @USTreasury nominee &amp; please their Wall Street friends.
So today at 2:15PM ET, we are holding a forum with OneWest Bank foreclosure victims. https://t.co/RMCZNyqxsC
25 Senators asked @SenOrrinHatch to hear from OneWest Bank foreclosure victims at Steve Mnuchin’s @USTreasury hearing. He refused.
Tune in now to watch @HELPCmteDems’s confirmation hearing with Tom Price for @HHSgov secretary: https://t.co/Xto9jqdsBS
I explained my concerns about Tom Price’s @HHSgov nomination in a 20-page letter yesterday. https://t.co/edaNYEBoWO
Tom Price has also championed proposals to privatize Medicare &amp; radically restructure Medicaid – weakening our nation’s health care.
Tom Price championed ACA repeal. He’s opposed improvements to women’s care. He’s cosponsored leg to discriminate against LGBT ppl.
The job of @HHSgov sec is to “enhance &amp; protect the health…of all Americans.” I’m not convinced Tom Price is willing or able to do that.
If #BetsyDeVos won't use @usedgov’s many tools &amp; resources to save students from fraud, she shouldn't be the Secretary of Education.

In fact, #BetsyDeVos has no experience with student loans, Pell Grants, or public education at all.
As @usedgov secretary, #BetsyDeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank. She has no experience doing that.

.@usedgov secretaries have served as teachers, school system leaders, governors – and Betsy DeVos has held no such position.
There is no precedent for a @usedgov secretary with the lack of experience in public education that Betsy DeVos has.

.@SenateDems &amp; I have asked @SenOrrinHatch to include outside witnesses for Mnuchin’s @USTreasury hearing. https://t.co/9kl5j5ScuY https://t.co/sOSIWL9Xx0
If being “the Foreclosure King” qualifies Mnuchin for @USTreasury, we should hear from ppl with first-hand experience with his businesses.

Rex Tillerson may try to dodge accountability in the US Senate – but @ExxonMobil certainly won’t dodge accountability from @MassAGO Healey.

.@ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson had a bad day yesterday. Wouldn’t call out his pal Putin. Claimed Exxon didn’t lobby against sanctions (it did).
The solution is clear: @realDonaldTrump must divest fully – putting his assets in a true blind trust. If he won't, Congress must require it.
.@HUDgov grants &amp; loans must be about helping the American people ONLY – not @realDonaldTrump's personal fortune.
Dr Carson danced around my q, because here’s the truth: He can’t promise it, b/c @realDonaldTrump won't eliminate his financial conflicts.
I asked Ben Carson a simple q: Can you assure us no @HUDgov money will help @realDonaldTrump’s business empire? https://t.co/Q3Dh4lPVL0
And if @realDonaldTrump won’t follow the Constitution, Congress must fight back every step of the way. https://t.co/wEG1wdljgO https://t.co/kNrsXY0JnY
If @realDonaldTrump truly wants to make America great &amp; put America first, he’ll divest his assets by placing them in a true blind trust.
The @OfficeGovEthics says he “[doesn’t] think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be @POTUS.” I don’t either. https://t.co/3i4PgapSOs
The idea that @realDonaldTrump will still own massive business interests as @POTUS isn’t only unethical – it puts us all at risk.

In fact, @USDOL Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder seems to have little respect for American workers at all.
.@realDonaldTrump’s pick to protect America’s workers is a fast food CEO whose burger chains have had numerous labor law violations.
My colleagues &amp; I will host a forum today at 3pm to hear from @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees employees. I hope you’ll tune in. https://t.co/GTfV3Diadr
.@SenAlexander refused our request to hear from Andrew Puzder’s employees at his confirmation hearing. https://t.co/tkxIcHZlCJ
22 of my colleagues &amp; I urged @SenAlexander to hold a hearing with Puzder’s employees &amp; other outside witnesses. https://t.co/TvdrZiwq9K
It’s essential for the HELP Committee to hear from Puzder’s employees to evaluate his qualifications &amp; suitability for @USDOL Secretary.
If confirmed as @USDOL Secretary, Andrew Puzder would oversee enforcement of many labor laws that @CarlsJr &amp; @Hardees reportedly violated.
Andrew Puzder’s fast food chains have had numerous violations of wage protection laws &amp; several class action lawsuits by employees.

A blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents. We still expect @realDonaldTrump to do the same.
Today @RepKClark, our Democratic colleagues &amp; I introduced the bill to implement the Emoluments Clause: https://t.co/wEG1wdljgO
The only way for @realDonaldTrump to truly eliminate conflicts is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust.
Americans STILL deserve to know that the President is doing what’s best for the country – not what’s best for himself &amp; his businesses.
It’s been 25 days since @realDonaldTrump promised to outline his plans for the Trump empire. We’re still waiting.
Cabinet officials must put our country's interests before their own. No conf hearings should be held until we’re certain that’s the case.
This is ridiculous. @realDonaldTrump’s noms can’t drag their feet on ethics paperwork while their Senate friends try to run out the clock.
.@OfficeGovEthics wrote back with “great concern” about the @SenateGOP’s confirmation hearings. https://t.co/YIC6e5TBSs
Confirmation hearings start Tuesday, so @SenSchumer &amp; I asked @OfficeGovEthics how the ethics reviews are going. https://t.co/z04Vyhxx5b
Confirmation hearings historically aren’t conducted until the @OfficeGovEthics certifies that each nominee has no unresolved conflicts.
The @SenateGOP are bypassing important steps to make sure these billionaire cabinet nominees are free of dangerous conflicts of interest.

And now the @HouseGOP is gutting its ethics office in the middle of the night – hours before the new Congress is sworn in.

If the outgoing Obama Admin won’t find a solution for SS recipients taxed on their forgiven student loans, the incoming Trump Admin should.
It’s baffling that @USTreasury won’t act to protect hundreds of thousands of people. https://t.co/XmNC1DEyOR
This is nuts. @USTreasury has helped real estate developers &amp; trust fund owners with taxes on forgiven debts – but not SS recipients?!
.@usedgov plans to forgive student loans for people with severe disabilities – but @USTreasury wants to stick them with a giant tax bill.
387k Social Security recipients are struggling to pay student loans but have been diagnosed with a disability so severe they can’t work.
Every nominee must follow the law before they are confirmed – even rich ones who think the rules don't apply. https://t.co/DwCczwAcu9
If President-elect @realDonaldTrump's cabinet nominees ignore the ethics rules, it's a recipe for corruption. https://t.co/eMPhPZRm4k
Rs &amp; Ds always require cabinet nominees to complete FBI background checks &amp; ethics agreements to resolve financial conflicts.
Federal agency appointees can face jail time if they make official government decisions that affect their own financial interests.
Cabinet officials must put the interests of the nation ahead of their own bank accounts. It's not just good government – it's the law.

Steve Mnuchin &amp; OneWest also ran Financial Freedom, which serviced 17% of reverse-mortgages but were responsible for 39% of foreclosures.
Steve Mnuchin &amp; OneWest Bank swooped in after the 2008 crash &amp; aggressively – &amp; sometimes illegally – foreclosed on people’s homes.
Placing assets in a true blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents. Our bill makes clear we expect Trump to do the same.

I look forward to working closely with the bases, companies &amp; research labs across MA as a member of the Armed Services Committee.
Massachusetts leads the US in innovative defense work &amp; scientific research. Our expertise is critical to keeping our country safe.
As we’ve seen with the recent Russian cyberattacks, the nature of our national security threats is changing, and we need to change too.
Congress must provide effective support &amp; oversight of the Armed Forces, monitor ntl security threats &amp; ensure responsible use of force.

Appointing Andrew Puzder to run the agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hard-working American family.
Andrew Puzder plotted to replace his workers with machines because they are "always polite" &amp; "never take a vacation."

I’ll keep fighting to implement the good policies in #CuresAct, repeal the giveaways, &amp; hold Congress accountable for NIH &amp; opioid funding.
But I believe the final 21st Century #CuresAct still failed to live up to the standards we should expect from our Congress.
We also got a ridiculous provision removed from the #CuresAct that would let drug companies hide kickbacks to doctors &amp; hospitals.
By fighting back, we changed a #CuresAct provision that would let @realDonaldTrump decide opioid spending. Now MA should get its fair share.
Republicans also broke their promise in the #CuresAct to meaningfully boost guaranteed funding for NIH and the opioid crisis.
Republicans concluded that bipartisan medical innovation in the #CuresAct would require a raft of giveaways to giant drug companies.
I’m glad that many good provisions in the #CuresAct will become law, but I’m disappointed by the price we paid for the GOP to pass the bill.
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision reducing the admin burden at NIH to ensure more efficient spending of fed research money.
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision ensuring the meaningful inclusion of women &amp; minorities in clinical trials.
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision supporting the development of genetically-targeted therapies for people with rare diseases.
The #CuresAct includes my bipartisan provision to strengthen Senator Kennedy’s work to protect the genetic privacy of patients.

HR 6392 would take power away from independent regulators &amp; give it to @realDonaldTrump’s choice for Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin.

If I were Wall Street &amp; the GOP, I’d be scared too: The @CFPB goes after big banks like @WellsFargo when they break the law.
The real reason Wall St &amp; their @GOP allies are going after the @CFPB is because it’s working too darn well for consumers &amp; must be stopped.
You’re going to hear a lot of reasons why we must make these changes to the @CFPB. Not one of them is going to be true.
It’s only been a few days since the election &amp; Wall St banks &amp; their @GOP friends are already licking their chops to undercut the @CFPB.
And @FCC should ban unreasonable pay-for-privacy schemes that coerce consumers to give up #privacy for discounts. https://t.co/CG8MNN9LcJ
The @FCC can do something about #broadband #privacy – &amp; they should @TomWheelerFCC @JRosenworcel @MClyburnFCC @AjitPaiFCC @mikeofcc
Right now we have no #broadband #privacy rules to protect consumers – no rules on how companies can collect, use, share, &amp; sell our data.
Great to see the @nytimes agrees it’s time to pass my Accreditation Reform and Enhanced Accountability Act: https://t.co/tqk48zWDlu
Glad to write the intro for @acslaw’s new Big Ideas report on top policy recs for the next administration: https://t.co/0oOlgE16oz
Congress should pass the #SAVEBenefits Act in Nov to give a much-needed boost to millions of Americans on Soc Security who have earned it.
.@RepDuckworth &amp; I introduced the #SAVEBenefits Act to give 70M Americans a one-time 3.9% Social Security payment. There's still time.
Today the @SocialSecurity Admin announced a 0.3% COLA for 2017. For many Americans struggling to make ends meet, that offers little relief.
The SEC needs new leadership to return to its mission to protect investors. @POTUS should use his authority to designate a new chair today
SEC Chair White has refused to advance a rule to require public corporations to disclose political spending despite broad bipartisan support
But under Chair White the SEC routinely ignores needs of investors to cater to interests of big businesses, dragging its feet on key rules
The SEC has a simple purpose: to protect investors by ensuring they have the information they need to make decisions
Today I asked @POTUS to immediately designate a new Chair of the SEC to replace Mary Jo White: https://t.co/Jin8kvpbZ5
I am heartsick for the 2 brave @bostonpolice officers shot in Boston, their families &amp; the entire BPD. Our gratitude &amp; prayers are with you.
A bank CEO should not be able to oversee a massive fraud &amp; simply walk away to enjoy his millions in retirement.
A bank teller would face criminal charges &amp; a prison sentence for stealing a handful of 20s from the cash drawer.
If @WellsFargo’s John Stumpf is leaving with all of his ill-gotten millions, that's still not real accountability.
As I said: @WellsFargo CEO Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made during the scam, &amp; face DOJ/SEC investigation. He’s 1 for 3.

Watch @RepGutierrez tell this Board to open its doors to actual Puerto Ricans, not just Wall Street. https://t.co/VvYErL4IAX
If this unelected Board wants Puerto Rico to believe it takes their crisis seriously, they can start by leaving NY. Start by showing up.
I guess holding the mtg in Puerto Rico would've been inconvenient. 20,000+ Zika cases. Recent blackouts left 1M w/o power. 340k w/o water.
Will this Board speak for the ppl of Puerto Rico or the bankers? Today it met for the first time - not in PR, but NYC. That's a bad start.
Congress passed a bill in June to "help" Puerto Rico - handing authority over PR to an unelected Board, but providing no actual resources.
Today I joined @SenSherrodBrown, @SenSanders &amp; 9 other @SenateDems to say no to trade deals with #ISDS. https://t.co/aATYWclM2T #TPP
It’s time for @usedgov's student loan bank to prove they care more about Corinthian’s victims than their own bottom line.
Today I wrote to @usedgov demanding their student loan bank halt collection of Corinthian students’ debt: https://t.co/qk6LpjPfeP
That means Corinthian’s victims eligible for loan forgiveness are instead having tax refunds, EITC &amp; Social Security garnished. It’s absurd.
We uncovered data that instead of simply discharging the loans of Corinthian’s victims, @usedgov pushed 80k of them to debt collectors.
Corinthian Colleges went belly up amid findings that it defrauded students. Under fed law, those students are eligible for loan discharge.
That’s the @GOP agenda in a nutshell: Pay Congress to do nothing, &amp; block back-breaking Americans from getting paid for a hard day’s work.
Last night @HouseGOP voted to delay our new overtime rule by 6 months. Kill a simple rule that hard-working people deserve to get paid.
.@SpeakerRyan’s Congress is on track to work the fewest days in decades. But what did they do last night before leaving town until November?
RT @VotingInMass: The voter registration deadline is 3 weeks away. Make sure your voter information is up to date:	https://t.co/g1xroLhd7B…
Deepest sympathies for the family of Shimon Peres on the passing of a dedicated public servant with an enduring commitment to peace.
As I said last week: Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was ongoing, &amp; face SEC &amp; DOJ investigations.
.@WellsFargo CEO Stumpf will be just fine: he keeps his job &amp; most of the money he made while massive fraud went on under his nose.
.@WellsFargo employees who tried to sound the alarm about the creation of fake accounts were fired. Their lives turned upside down.
.@WellsFargo employees who failed to meet management's outrageous sales goals were fired.
This is a small step in the right direction, but nowhere near real accountability. https://t.co/7Aj4fxXp9x
Watch my speech calling on @SenateGOP to end their outrageous demands &amp; to stop threatening a gov shutdown. https://t.co/FeX2lsYmvG
And any politician who won't stand with Flint, MI - whose kids are choking on poisoned water - lacks the moral courage to serve in Congress.
If @SenateGOP seriously think they can hold the gov hostage to protect political corruption w/o anyone noticing, they'd better think again.
Every agency w/ jurisdiction should follow @USDOL's lead &amp; determine whether @WellsFargo &amp; its senior execs should be prosecuted/sanctioned.
I'm glad @USDOL announced today that it will conduct a prompt &amp; thorough "top-to-bottom review" of @WellsFargo. https://t.co/IJN1XVDmF6
Last week we asked @USDOL to investigate whether @WellsFargo violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. https://t.co/uLSbc4A4mX
We will not sit by while our planet is destroyed so that the super rich can make an extra buck.
My @SenateDems colleagues issued a report showing how the fossil fuel industry funds Clean Power Plan opponents. https://t.co/b50fN7afnM
The fossil fuel industry made billions at the expense of our environment. Now they want to kill the country’s plan to reduce air toxins.
Want to see 1 more example of the @GOP putting billionaires first? Just look at their opposition to the Clean Power Plan.
.@WellsFargo’s Stumpf will be accountable only if he resigns, returns every nickel he got during the scam, &amp; faces DOJ &amp; SEC investigation.
If John Stumpf can oversee a massive fraud &amp; walk away w/ $100M+, why should we expect any CEO to follow the law? https://t.co/wixnesLKGh
Yesterday I led a letter to @USDOL to investigate if @WellsFargo misclassified workers &amp; failed to pay overtime: https://t.co/JdsIupLhmQ
The @CFPB’s investigation of @WellsFargo uncovered staggering workplace conditions imposed on employees to meet sales quotas.
.@WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf blamed his bank’s massive fraud on 5300 low-level bank tellers, branch managers &amp; customer service reps.
Congress must do more to reform higher ed accreditation, so I introduced a bill w/ @SenatorDurbin &amp; @SenBrianSchatz: https://t.co/33bV95cRNF
.@usedgov did the right thing today to protect students &amp; taxpayers by stripping ACICS of its college accreditation power.
Corinthian &amp; ITT Tech committed fraud to drown students in debt with useless degrees, but ACICS accredited both when they filed bankruptcy.
College accreditation is supposed to make sure kids get a good education while colleges take taxpayer money. But the system is broken.
.@SenateGOP has billions of reasons to defend this rotten system - but we're sick of it &amp; ready to fight. https://t.co/acTsbKkKU4
If @SenateMajLdr thinks he can hold the whole government hostage to shield donors buying off politicians, think again.
We know why - billions in secret dark money is flowing into our political system, to prop up @realDonaldTrump &amp; his GOP allies in Congress.
But here we go again - Republicans are threatening to shut down the gov in days unless we ban disclosure of corporate political spending.
Shutting down the government isn't very popular with the American people. You'd think the Republicans would've learned that by now.
If you missed my questions for @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf on his gutless leadership earlier today, take a look. https://t.co/5brb1ARRqC
Tonight I'll be talking to Rachel @Maddow about today's @SenateBanking hearing with @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf. Tune in at 9PM ET!
Watch my questioning of @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf &amp; his gutless leadership at today’s @SenateBanking hearing: https://t.co/5brb1AAgz4
.@WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf should resign, give back the money he took while the scam was going on, &amp; be criminally investigated.
A bank cashier who steals $20 would be facing theft charges, but Wall St execs never hold themselves accountable. Not in 2008 &amp; not now.
We know @WellsFargo’s Board knew of exec Carrie Tolstedt’s misconduct, but she’ll still retire with a huge payout: https://t.co/leTA3jL4we
We know @WellsFargo is proud of cross-selling - getting customers to open more accounts. See the earnings calls: https://t.co/gPflL7JtkL
.@WellsFargo’s definition of “accountable” is to push blame on low-level employees who don’t have money or PR firms to defend themselves.
The @CFPB caught @WellsFargo in a massive, years-long scam. CEO John Stumpf hasn’t resigned. He hasn’t fired 1 senior executive.
Today at 10am @SenateBanking will question @WellsFargo CEO John Stumpf about its years-long scam. Watch: https://t.co/EG5ZjTAP7j
I agree with @SenMarkey – it's time to #UnlockTheBox. https://t.co/RxvFH4nyB6
Watch my speech on our bill to make sure every Presidential candidate releases their taxes – even @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/hCCRK0ZUtk
.@realDonaldTrump won't release his taxes voluntarily. Let's pass the Presidential Tax Transparency Act and make sure he comes clean.
We don't know what @realDonaldTrump is hiding in his taxes. What new tax scams he's running. Which foreign dictators have him on the take.
Every major party Presidential candidate should release their tax returns. And they all do – except @realDonaldTrump. He's just too chicken.
Thanks, FCIC Chair @PhilAngelides. I agree: This wasn't "immaculate corruption" - DOJ's failure defies common sense. https://t.co/W9MOrTjfWw
The @FBI released @HillaryClinton’s info citing “intense public interest.” It should do the same for its Wall Street FCIC investigations.
I’ve also asked the @FBI to release its investigation materials related to FCIC referrals. https://t.co/iicSLZ2Wwf https://t.co/rvt4JF8frd
I've asked @TheJusticeDept to investigate its inability to prosecute the FCIC's referrals. https://t.co/iicSLZ2Wwf https://t.co/oVNl7ghEx3
Not one of the people or corporations referred to @TheJusticeDept by the FCIC has been criminally prosecuted. That’s an abysmal failure.
The FCIC investigated the causes of the 2008 crisis. Recently-released docs show they referred 9 people &amp; 14 corps to @TheJusticeDept.
8 years ago today, Lehman Bros filed for bankruptcy. The big banks recklessly gambled with our economy &amp; millions of people suffered for it.
Rep @LamarSmithTX21’s big oil buddies don’t want state AGs to do their jobs, but the AGs aren’t going to cower to big oil or the GOP.
You don’t need a hearing to know basic facts, @LamarSmithTX21: the US Constitution gives states power to enforce state laws.
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 held a hearing today on his unprecedented step of subpoenaing state AGs for investigating @exxonmobil.
The American people pay us to get things done, @SenateGOP. With this schedule, I’d want my money back. #DoYourJob https://t.co/XiZoYvht6O

Read my @nytimes op-ed about how Congress should fix our broken corporate tax code: https://t.co/SsUA4SfYOz
When tax dodgers move back to the US, they should pay their fair share – just as working families &amp; small businesses have been all along.
Now that other leading countries are starting to get tough on tax enforcement, corporate tax dodgers want to move money back to the US.
Corporate tax dodgers have taken full advantage of the benefits of being a US company while searching for every way to avoid paying taxes.
We need MORE transparency &amp; accountability in shadow banking, not less. @HouseDemocrats: stand up to Wall St lobbyists &amp; oppose HR 5424.
One @HouseGOP bill being pushed this week, HR 5424, would let private equity &amp; hedge funds disclose even LESS info to federal regulators.
1st order of business for @HouseGOP after a 7-wk recess? Not Zika. Not LA flooding. Just a pile of bills to weaken the rules on Wall Street.
All we’re asking is for the @SenateGOP to stop playing politics with judicial nominees and #DoYourJob. This is disgraceful.
Today I called on the @SenateGOP to consider 10 nominees already passed through Judiciary. They said no. https://t.co/6u3LeFmH4y #DoYourJob
The @SenateGOP have made it very clear: They want @realDonaldTrump to appoint judges who will bend the law for their interests. #DoYourJob
Today there are more than twice as many judicial vacancies &amp; emergencies as there were at this point in the Bush Admin. #DoYourJob
The @SenateGOP are setting new records for obstruction with judicial nominations – leaving courts overburdened &amp; understaffed. #DoYourJob

#Zika funding isn’t a place for your selfish, partisan games, @SenateGOP. People’s lives are at risk. Bring a clean bill to a vote NOW.
After a 7-wk @GOP recess, the @SenateGOP's 1st priority is the same old #Zika bill that hurts women, vets, Obamacare, @PPFA &amp; clean water.
19 of my @SenateDems colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to Mylan for answers about the EpiPen price hike: https://t.co/Q3q1yTinBN
Mylan’s promise of a new generic EpiPen for half the price only further calls into question the excessive price of branded EpiPens.
Mylan’s expanded patient assistance programs are an industry game to keep EpiPen costs high for insurance companies, the gov &amp; employers.
I have serious concerns about pharmaceutical giant Mylan’s significant price hikes for the life-saving EpiPen Auto-Injector.
.@ITTTech's free ride is finally over &amp; the message is clear: We won't stand by &amp; allow these shady schools to cheat students &amp; taxpayers.
Today, @usedgov has finally said enough is enough, banning @ITTTech from enrolling any new students with federal dollars this fall.
The SEC, @CFPB, &amp; @MassAGO are all suing @ITTTech for fraud &amp; they failed, again, to meet the low standards of their accrediting agency.
.@ITTTech – a massive, for-profit college – is currently under investigation by 20 state &amp; federal agencies for cheating students.
Great news: @TheJusticeDept will end its use of ineffective &amp; dangerous private prisons - 1 step to fix our broken criminal justice system.

.@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.
Every MA delegation member signed a letter to @LamarSmithTX21 w/ concerns about this disgraceful pander to Big Oil. https://t.co/fUl9DZ1liu
GOP says @MassAGO’s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies don’t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.
We haven't found another example – not one – of a House committee subpoenaing a STATE AG's investigation of potential STATE law violations.
The @HouseGOP claims to be for states’ rights, but they don’t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law.
Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman— a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.
Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53Hk
Yesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5
Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG.
This is an outrageous abuse of Congressional subpoena power to threaten a state AG and help a campaign contributor.
For the @GOP, states’ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women’s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud.
.@LamarSmithTX21 says he “takes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitution” — but apparently not the 10th Amendment.
Yup, that’s right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AG’s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law.
Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee — a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas — to subpoena @MassAGO.
First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because she’s doing her job.
.@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.
Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.
Heartsick for the families of the Baton Rouge police officers killed today. More violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.
The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount https://t.co/kAUI4UG4pS
We need our gov agencies to work together to warn students, veterans &amp; families about other unlicensed “universities” like Trump “U.”
11 Senate Dems &amp; I sent a letter to @usedgov, @FTC, @CFPB &amp; @DeptVetAffairs about fake schools like Trump “U”: https://t.co/HqofUVw95d
Trump U violated NY law by calling itself a "university" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme.
The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples.
Marriage equality is the law of the land. But #LGBT Americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.
I’m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.
Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but I know this: change must come. It must come now.
I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.
I’m sick at heart for the families of the officers killed in Dallas. Sick at heart for the families of the men shot in LA &amp; MN.
Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities.
No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those we’ve already  lost.
#blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.
We can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to “survive” the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmatter
Most cops are good ppl. But we can’t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to “survive” police. #blacklivesmatter
We’ve seen the sickening videos of black Americans killed in traffic stops. Lives ended by those sworn to protect them. #blacklivesmatter

I love strong, healthy markets – but for markets to work, we need competition. Consolidation &amp; concentration are on the rise.
#Zika isn't just coming. It's here. If the GOP won’t take it seriously, they must accept responsibility for the devastating consequences.
Every day @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP don't take #Zika seriously, more ppl get sick. 481 pregnant women in US states &amp; territories have Zika NOW.
Is this some sort of sick joke, @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus — and our country’s response to this emergency — just a game to you?!
I didn’t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, PP, AND clean water all at once – but they did it. #Zika
The GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M – money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.
The GOP #Zika bill rolls back Clean Water Act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of Americans’ drinking water.
The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
The GOP #Zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.
The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund, even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak.
The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.
Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am.
4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act – and the GOP dragged their feet.
My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP just tried to pass.
.@SpeakerRyan &amp; the @HouseGOP: You should be ashamed of yourselves for your totally corrupt priorities. People are watching.
.@HouseDemocrats: Please vote NO on this veto override. We weren’t sent here to do dirty work for Wall St’s armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.
When @SpeakerRyan turns off the cameras, the @HouseGOP gets to work — both for the @NRA AND for Wall Street. Unbelievable.
.@SpeakerRyan scheduled a vote tonight to kill a new @USDOL rule that protects workers’ retirement savings from shady financial advisers.
After a whole day of #NoBillNoBreak, @HouseGOP is instead moving on a vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl. Really.

I called for immediate votes on 15 judicial nominees. @SenateMajLdr objected. 9 nominees? No. 4 nominees? No. Just 1 nominee? No.
I took @SenateGOP's deal: 2 other judges confirmed if I’d keep quiet. Then today I went back to the floor to call for votes on the 15.
I wanted to request votes for the 15 District Court noms on Monday – but @SenateMajLdr didn’t want to be embarrassed so he cut me a deal.
The @senjudiciary Committee has cleared 15 nominees for federal District Courts. Those nominees are still waiting for confirmation votes.

Gov is supposed to work for all of us. But when it comes to making sure courts &amp; watchdogs are staffed, @SenateGOP refuse to do their jobs.
Congress wasn’t elected to help predatory lenders. If anyone tries to block or delay the @CFPB payday rules, it’s time to fight back hard.
Payday lending is a $7B/yr industry. That buys a lot of influence in Congress – not just with the GOP, but also some Democrats.
The proposed payday lending rule isn’t perfect – it could do more – but the payday industry is already firing back.
The @CFPB’s new rule cracks down on tricks payday lenders use to generate thousands in interest &amp; fees from ppl trapped in cycles of debt.
It’s another good day: The @CFPB just took a big step to protect consumers from predatory payday loans. https://t.co/KtnxEk4F1E
We’ll gear up &amp; fight back, like we’ve done so many times before. We won’t let the @CFPB be destroyed by Wall St &amp; their Washington friends.
The @CFPB has handled 900k complaints &amp; forced big banks to return $11B to people they cheated. @HouseGOP can’t stand gov that works.

When these OT changes take effect in December, millions will have a fighting chance to build more financial security. That’s a big deal!
Big companies &amp; trade associations flooded @USDOL with criticism of this overtime change, but workers spoke up too — and @USDOL listened.
.@USDOL’s new overtime rule guarantees anyone earning less than $47,476/yr will qualify for OT — nearly 40% of full-time salaried workers.
Anyone who puts in a hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. Today @USDOL released an overtime pay rule that helps make that happen.

Read my letter to Chair Mary Jo White about my serious concerns with the SEC: https://t.co/8CHbzCAIpH
This decision is a mockery of the SEC's core mission &amp; the latest example of the SEC failing to punish guilty parties &amp; protect investors.
Just 2 months after Cohen's sanction, the SEC approved the application of a new investment firm co-owned by… Steven Cohen. Seriously.
SAC Capital pled guilty to insider trading in 2013. In Jan, the SEC barred its manager Steven Cohen from managing outside funds until 2018.

Today, our top regulators warned us about the danger of the biggest banks. We would be foolish to ignore their warnings.
This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.
No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks.
Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.
The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.
There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.
Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.
Unless the banks promptly address regulators’ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex.
5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren’t bailed out. It’s a very big deal. It’s scary.
Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. https://t.co/zZNeA8HjrN
The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: https://t.co/knv4GUBu8G
And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.
The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.
It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.
My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.
Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.
Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.
This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services.
Read my office’s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: https://t.co/wXXrLh60T7
That means taxpayers have to spend billions – and share personal info with 3rd-parties – just to file taxes.
The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.

#PuertoRico's debt crisis means young people like Jonathan Zamora have to flee to places like Boston for work. https://t.co/UocBNZmgwx
#PuertoRico's debt crisis means Harvard-trained Dr Lisgelia Santana is afraid for her family to go to the hospital. https://t.co/B7vjLqndPO
After 10 yrs of recession, #PuertoRico is in a terrible hole of debt with vulture funds trying to squeeze every last drop. #PRDayofAction
It is my strong hope @JohnKingatED will make fixing these problems a top priority from his 1st day on the job until his last day on the job.
Watch my new floor speech about @JohnKingatED’s nomination &amp; the state of @usedgov: https://t.co/QUqCCiPa1g
.@JohnKingatED didn’t create these problems at @usedgov – but he has a lot of work to do to get the Dept’s higher ed house in order.
Secretary of Ed is one of the toughest jobs, because for yrs @usedgov has put student loan companies &amp; for-profit colleges before students.
The Senate just voted to confirm @JohnKingatED to be the next Secretary of Education – one of the most important jobs in DC.
Now the @CFTC should act to protect consumers by quickly finalizing the Dodd-Frank-required position limits rule.
.@CFTC Commissioner Giancarlo made the right decision to withdraw this flawed report.
Today, the @CFTC withdrew the advisory committee’s report: https://t.co/UIS5uEIsTv
Two weeks ago, I tweeted about a @CFTC advisory committee report written by industry insiders. https://t.co/gRQyLO6X3U
.@ElizabethBanks isn't from District 12 or the Capitol, she's from Pittsfield! Great to see her (&amp; @Americans4Arts). https://t.co/XRbS5k1AC5
Today groups delivered 800k petition signatures to @SenateMajLdr’s office - urging a vote on the #SAVEBenefits Act. https://t.co/F19uymKJhA
Watch my new floor speech telling the @Senate_GOPs: #doyourjob &amp; consider a SCOTUS nominee: https://t.co/UdPOJ8bayc
The game's over. If @Senate_GOPs want to stand up to extremist candidates, they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate.
.@Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting @POTUS’s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly.
At the same time they’re blocking any SCOTUS nominee, @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.
Glad to intro @RepJoeKennedy's bill in the Sen to strengthen accountability &amp; give consumers better tools for info.  https://t.co/oIYolosPr9
Another sign the bipartisan chorus is growing to make sure Wall Street fund managers pay their fair share: https://t.co/J6sRgItlai
Read my new @TalkPoverty op-ed on why we need the #SAVEBenefits Act to give seniors &amp; vets a SS raise: https://t.co/TZsHxz9LiQ
Any conversation about tackling poverty in the US should include protecting &amp; expanding Social Security.
The @CFPB should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. No delays, and no carve-outs.
The @CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the @CFPB, not sabotage it.
Until the @CFPB, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.
2.5 million households borrow from payday lenders each year, with more storefronts in the US than McDonald’s and Starbucks combined.
FMLA was a huge step fwd, and we must do more. Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed on how to level the playing field: https://t.co/uRk48gJvkM
We need real agency reform to level the playing field - not to give lobbyists more chances to block outcomes they don’t like.
Read my letter to @CTFC Commissioner Giancarlo, calling on him to withdraw this report: https://t.co/naYfAuGNBZ
The @CFTC committee’s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.
The @CFTC report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.
The advisory committee behind this compromised @CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders – violating Dodd-Frank.
Today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the @CFTC’s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.
Under Dodd-Frank, Congress directed the @CFTC to establish the EEMAC – an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.
Today I joined the @SenateDems at the Supreme Court to tell the GOP: #DoYourJob on a #SCOTUS nominee. https://t.co/hVjX9KfnYj
Medical experts agree: Whatever you think of medical marijuana, it's  irresponsible not to study the science:  https://t.co/VTgRzoLmOr
Serious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies.
Medical marijuana might be a viable alternative to opioids for pain treatment, but truthfully, there's a lot we just don't know.
Partial fill policies for opioids can help reduce the number of unused pills in circulation. Watch: https://t.co/ieQoVyTMJx #partialfillbill
Wishing my very best for a speedy recovery to one of the Senate’s toughest fighters, @clairecmc. The whole Twitterverse is here for you!
Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that – empty talk.
The Senate GOP took an oath just like Dems did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution &amp; our democracy.
I can’t find a clause in the Constitution that says “…except when there’s a year left in the term of a Democratic President.”
Art II Sec 2 of the Constitution says the President nominates Supreme Court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate.
.@SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact, they did: when @POTUS won in 2012.
The sudden death of Justice Scalia creates an immediate vacancy on the most important court in the United States.
.@RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to @USDOL about advisors’ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule https://t.co/U7y9ZoFrxi
But when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders, the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say they’ll be fine.
Financial companies have predicted dire consequences from a new rule requiring them to act in customers’ best interests.
I won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen @US_FDA &amp; seriously fund medical research.
Watch my remarks to the HELP Committee today on why Congress needs to commit to funding medical research: https://t.co/mq25Z1DOAX
Heading into an election, it'd be easy for Congress to pass some small bills, declare victory &amp; quit. But that's not good enough.
Last yr, @newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem “takes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.” I agree.
Big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. Instead of funding that research, Congress has spent a decade choking off support.
The Senate HELP Committee approved bills today to advance US medical innovation. I voted for those bills - but it isn't enough.
On #FMLA23, we remember how much more we need to do to level the playing field for workers &amp; families. https://t.co/JRqeMniImE
On #GoRedForWomen Day, I’m fighting to double NIH funding to help millions of women live longer, healthier lives. https://t.co/EoYuUTo0Zl
If we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen’s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: https://t.co/sm3QxIsEFA
Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.
Tell Congress: They work for the American people — not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.
You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
Nope — right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.
You’d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?
Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis – but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.
If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.
Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: https://t.co/NWX8Et2hqA
The American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits – and they didn’t send us here to help the bandits.
Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow, the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
It’s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.
We have one set of law on the books, but two legal systems: One for the rich &amp; powerful, and one for everyone else.
Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss my enforcement report &amp; GOP efforts to weaken Wall St accountability: https://t.co/fbMGC9EVjR
Today I urged Congress to reject the #TPP deal before it makes things even worse for America’s families: https://t.co/h339ZKInfy
Congress will have to vote straight up or down on #TPP.  We won’t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like ISDS.
A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS.
12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.
Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support #InTheRed, then what's your plan for student loan debt? https://t.co/kIjPpgSgRy
Thanks everyone for coming to our Springfield open house today! I'm happy to fight for Western MA in the Senate. https://t.co/g90P757ZaG
The next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.
Read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: https://t.co/BZZSpjm7VS
Today my office released a report on 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015: https://t.co/u0R2JX1BNd
Presidents don’t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference.
Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all.
2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas, but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress.
Today we remember Framingham’s Christa McAuliffe &amp; the astronauts we lost 30 yrs ago on #Challenger: https://t.co/6qRkgUhEFG
I don’t love Wall St bankers who break our economy – but I LOVED #TheBigShort. Great to meet @GhostPanther today! https://t.co/l8cNe1gZ17
Yesterday, @SenateDems announced our new #InTheRed campaign to help students getting crushed with debt. https://t.co/kQ2zexKehN
This Congress doesn’t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them.
Here’s a whole list of things Congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: https://t.co/xjGe3EzdgA
We can – and we should – blame the Supreme Court for #CitizensUnited. But that is no excuse for doing nothing.
Money floods our political system, letting a handful of billionaires shape who gets into Congress &amp; may decide who sits in the White House.
Six years ago today, #CitizensUnited turned loose a flood of hidden money that is about to drown our democracy.
Consumers need a central place to turn to for help when they are denied coverage for mental health care. Watch: https://t.co/oKkdL1ZTeB
Our acting ED Sec @JohnKingatED hit a home run by asking Rohit Chopra to help fix our broken student loan system. https://t.co/vxTmrfEmPl
.@POTUS &amp; the @SenateDems are fighting for students &amp; families #InTheRed. It’s long past time for the GOP leadership to join us.
Our country should be encouraging students like Alexis, but student loan debt is crushing them &amp; limiting their opportunities. #InTheRed
Alexis is working on her BA in math &amp; wants to become a public school teacher, but she’s already taken on over $50,000 in debt. #InTheRed
I’d like for you to meet my #SOTU guest: Alexis, a 1st generation college student at @UMassLowell. #InTheRed https://t.co/AkbYQhcUI7
Very glad to speak to @ShuttleCDRKelly today about ways we can keep fighting to #StopGunViolence in America. https://t.co/DskXFUE3UB
This #KeystoneXL lawsuit shows: ISDS was a bad idea for NAFTA, and it’s a bad idea for TPP. https://t.co/JgmCXPEge8

I strongly support @POTUS’s action to #stopgunviolence. If Congress won’t step up to keep our kids safe, somebody else needs to start.
Gun violence is an epidemic. But day after day, tragedy after tragedy, the GOP has blocked even the smallest steps to #stopgunviolence.
The new CFTC rule sells out taxpayers &amp; jeopardizes the safety of our financial system. https://t.co/YUjwetTTAj

The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. We need smart ideas to solve it, like @GloucesterPD’s work to treat addiction w/o arrests.
Tell your Senators: They weren't sent to Washington to carry water for Wall Street. https://t.co/mgwXPhpKVZ
They're trying to tack rollbacks on leg like the funding bill Congress must pass next wk to prevent a gov shutdown. It's cynical &amp; corrupt.
Wall St lobbyists know they can't roll back financial regulations out in the public, so they tack them onto must-pass pieces of legislation.

Thanks @SenMarkey @SenBillNelson @maziehirono @SenSchumer @SenatorLeahy @SenWhitehouse @alfranken for speaking out on the #SAVEBenefits Act!
That’s why I’ve introduced the #SAVEBenefits Act to give seniors, vets &amp; disabled Americans a one-time 3.9% SS boost on Jan 1st.
