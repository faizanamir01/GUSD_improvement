When the children cry let them know we tried	'Cause when the children sing then the new world begins		Little child you must show the way	To a better day for all the young	'Cause you were born for all the world to see 	That we all can live with love and peace
Little child dry your crying eyes	How can I explain the fear you feel inside	'Cause you were born into this evil world	Where man is killing man and no one knows just why	What have we become just look what we have done	All that we destroyed you must build again

Bernie is anIndependent Democrat both Parties Ideals combined Infrastructure, Education,Healthcare,Income equality,Environment, All issues that matter to me. 	Issues that needs a person who cares about America and the World. Not money over people, Not Party over people. People!!!
They bumped Bernie out from Democratic nomination and kept the lessor threat to them in. For all we know Every level of government seat that filled the House and Senate Republican majority were meddled. Putin succeeded If he was trying to F**k the USA.
Bernie early. So now we know Donald's campaign colluded with Russia and WikiLeaks, Cambridge, They knew Bernie was going to be tough to beat if he were nominated. Don't you think that those guys manipulated the DNC primaries  they are proven to manipulate the Election of Trump.
We already know now that Russia played a huge role disrupting our Voting processes, possibly undermining the DNC in some way turning voters away from HRC, uncovering emails between the DNC chair and HRC. Didn't help her! That with the voter suppression I mentioned eliminated
Allowed him. Those who do have the power to stop him but don't, Obviously the majority of Republicans in the House and Senate are Involved in one way or the other, I truthfully, reluctantly voted for HRC. Voting the lessor of two Candidates that a shrowd of discrepancy cloaked.
I am positive this happened all across the country, and also positive many of you Supported Bernie's Ideals. We really need to convince the Democrats to pull together. Independents and Democrats can Change This Insane unreal time. Don't just blame Donald but the people who have
There are millions of us Independent voters could have changed the outcome early in the Primaries, Those of us living in States like NY only accept votes from 2 parties, Democrat and Republican If you ask me Is voter suppression. I wanted Bernie but couldn't vote in the Primaries

@deppraw Yes you are right it is the past but it really does matter. All states all party primaries . And  Gen election most popular votes . It can't be just ignored it must be addressed and included with all the other aspects of the breakdown of our countries voting processes in 2016
@deppraw At least she writes her own speeches
@deppraw Biden and Kennedy?, Will provide 16 yrs solid leadership	 Biden and Obama? Yes M.O
@deppraw You refuse to admit Bernie got F'ed from the start. Millions of Independent voters were kept from voting in states primaries only recognize 2party , how many more votes would Bernie have gotten? As of current polls 45% Registered Independent, 29% Dem,24% Republican
@deppraw Hillary wouldn't have been in the picture because Bernie would have won the dnc nomination, head of the dnc admitted and stepped out remember?
@deppraw To far left of the madness we live in now?, by your insist makes it no better to be compacent than the right for backing obvious corrupted donald
@deppraw Think about it,. Russians wanted trump and knew bernie was going to be tough competition do by hacking the dnc primaries it would put Hillary in and there was a lot about Hillary in question just threw a lot of people running in the other direction
@deppraw Bernie should never conceded he is the real hero in 2016 for taking the bullet to save the election, He was the only Democratic canidate under investigation for anything! hindsight has proven he would have defeated trump, even the Russians couldn't have stopped him,
https://t.co/1xXxTt8tNa
I agreeand will get the word out, but I refuse to replace a corrupted president with a corrupted canidate.The entire election was a sham, Let the 2016-2020 election be reset, the former president should remain until the next election.

I hope and pray, The DNC doesn't let what happened in the last election ever happen again. Please get Registered and vote. If you care about the future of USA . Voting matters
I'm Registered, I have been registered Independent, Switched to Democrat. The main reason for switching because in NY you can only vote in the Primaries if you are registered Democrat or Republican. The main reason I believe Bernie didn't get the nomination. https://t.co/6NkQCSuXqp

Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!		Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!

machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!
- men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men -
- the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. …..		Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes

More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost….		The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men -
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity.
And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.		Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
- if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone.
