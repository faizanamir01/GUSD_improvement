@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov Its no one's fault be your own that you sexualize women
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov I'm not the one saying that women shouldn't be given the same opportunities as men. If it ain't your sister, you probably have never gotten a girl, have you? (based on your previous statements, I already know the answer)
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov 111 followers on your "real" page vs my 1390 on my "fake" one? one of us isnt doing something right.
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov Slow down there, fella; i can smell ur sister on ur breath.
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov So no, you dont have any connection between the  strengths/weaknesses of genders and the draft.
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov What does strength have to do with the draft? Most of the jobs in the military dont require any sort of physical strength.  Your biological strength has nothing to do with the draft.

@Anom1c @SSS_gov No.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov That's the current rule they have for men.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Can you please rephrase what you said?
@Anom1c @SSS_gov if a woman has a child and the woman is not a key supporter for their household, yes i do.		But i have already said this many times. I assume you are trying to get me to say something contradictory. If you have anything new to say, i will respond. If not, I won't.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov And in most cases they dont punish a man who does that, society does.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov They may just wait 9 months and then draft the mom. What would happen to the child would be different for most cases.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov I wouldnt call it complicated, its just hard to explain through twitter into a closed mind.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov I suppose out of all of the things i have said, that would be the one thing i was mistaken on.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov If she could prove that she was financially needed and it would be a hardship for her dependents, no. But if she couldnt, yes.		Its the same rule they already have implemented for men.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Maybe it is, but again im not the supreme court nor congress, it would be up to them.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Or they could just wait 9 months for the baby to be born and then send her off.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov No, because they would be pregnant. They would have to prove beyond responsible doubt that the woman was lying. If she wasnt, the DOJ and constitution would most likely have her back.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Avoiding the draft is a crime (which this would be), but they could have a sort of policy that prevents prison time because the perpetrator is pregnant. Im not the Supreme Court or Congress, so i dont know 100% what will happen.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov Sorta, yea. Not 100%, but i would think that would be the basis.
@Anom1c @SSS_gov It IS her choice. However, using a child to avoid the draft most likely means she didnt care about it in the first place.		(I also said it would most likely be a crime, the penalty for it could be anything, a fine, jail, or absolutely nothing.)
@beckoh @SSS_gov What kinds of idiotic tweets?
@Anom1c @SSS_gov (Purposefully) getting pregnant after being drafted would be considered a crime for avoiding the draft.		If they are already pregnant, they wouldnt be drafted.		If they are the sole guardian or primary source of food and whatnot, they would also not be drafted.		Pretty simple.
@DC_Matthew @SSS_gov So men are more disposable than women?
@matthewp1979 @SSS_gov Why do you think only men should be drafted?

And just like that, a flag representing humans to other lifeforms should look something like this: https://t.co/EMJJxFvZw4
It could also have a black peace (to show a nonviolent idea of our species) symbol (Hinduism is the first established belief, so the symbol should be from that religion) the middle of the circle (to show that no matter how bright, there is always darkness)
and have a red background (showing how blood that is spilled is all in support of goodness)
The flag could have a white circle (representing the sun and goodness)
If we plan to go to other planets, we will need a flag that accurately describes human history.		If red black and white were the first colors acknowledged by humans (through blood, night, and day) why not just make a flag that is red black and white?
@TourguideJ @VP No, the original (the tweet you are responding to) tweet was congratulating him for his achievement in the Marines (separate to that of the retweeted tweet).		Instead, you should respond to the tweet that Pence retweeted.

@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Yes. Because presidents are human and they are immoral.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris The fact you won't look proves that it is you who is unopen to new ideas.		In addition, your comments only further prove my initial point.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Im simply saying that humans are immoral. Naturally. I have literally no idea how you are trying to disagree with that.

@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Would you like to show me what's moral about their living situations?
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris Its undeniable that Trump's bombings of Syria have resulted in half as many civilian casualties as guilty ones. Might want to fact check that one
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris He has denied the citizenship of people legally trying to enter the country. Walking into girls's dressing rooms and frequently calling women golddiggers isnt exactly moral.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris A bombing that caused half as many innocent casualties as soldier casualties.
@docsmoon @KamalaHarris I would say denying citizenship, allowing racists in washington, degrading women, keeping kids in cages, and many more are fairly immoral decisions.

@Micahsdaddy69 Tell me, if anyone important, read this and was like "omg this is a foolproof explanation for the minimum wage debate! I will be sure to implement this ASAP!"
If it wasnt, we'd have 1 president from 1 political party with 0 advisors. Because this isnt Orwell's 1984 and a difference in opinion will always benefit.
Whether or not you believe in climate change (or anything for that matter), its almost always beneficial to have a difference of opinions. https://t.co/bPSn83DWoL
@Micahsdaddy69 In the end, i think that if you get a minimum wage job, you should expect to live the minimum (next to no luxuries).		However, with only 8% of Americans owning a business and neither of us being a part of that 8%, its safe to say what was said here wont matter in the long run.

@Micahsdaddy69 I may have never been employed, but my immediate family has a combined 130 years of work experience. And they could all atest that free products/employee discounts have only encouraged them to work.
@Micahsdaddy69 That usually a simiar case now with emplotee discounts or free food. It allows employees financial benefits that also benefit the company (employees get food and will be encouraged to work as a result)
@Micahsdaddy69 The same can be saud for hiring. With a minimum wage of lets say $5, a company can hire triple the amount of workers and be able to pay good workers more based on quality rather than cutting the workforce in half because not everyone can do $15 worth of work.
@Micahsdaddy69 But if they raise prices (more than they do know because they will compensate for the profit they will be losing), your new wealth wouldnt do anything because everything is now more expensive, moreso than it would be otherwise.
@Independent His name would be "General Lee" btw
@Micahsdaddy69 Yes, i had a stroke typing that
@Micahsdaddy69 Thats more of a reason to raise prices. Theyll be makig EVEN MORE money. Its that or lose money (im sure I which theyd pick)
@TheWidowmakerX Nothing Semen		What about you, @Micahsdaddy69, @syobevoli, and @Its_Fern_02?

@syobevoli The closest thing they had to a perfect balance was AC Rogue. It had the old story elements, and included a compelling, ORIGINAL story
@syobevoli They should do one about Jacob and Evie's parents about the fall of London to the Templars. Cuz then you know the prologue (Kenway), story (this one), the arc (Syndicate), and the end (The WWI Syndicate) of the Templars in London. It would finish the unfinished story arc.

By this time (if vamps are revealed) town has to kill 3 vamps. In addition, vamps will have bitten a new guy n6. So the vamps can still win.

@crod1906 @thehill Does that make it ok?
I honestly think that there is only a true "Chaos" game in #TownofSalem.		It's a custom game with these roles:		Sheriff	Sheriff	Sheriff	Jailor	Veteran	Bodyguard	Vigilante		Godfather	Framer	Janitor	Disguiser		Executioner	Executioner	Jester	Witch
@townofsalemgame The new role, or "Exorcist" would select any of the 14 players, and if their target was a townie turned vamp, they would become a townie again. It could also be that if Exorcist becomes a vamp, he could commit suicide, or something. Idk, this was just a solution I thought of.
@townofsalemgame I personally think that vampires are to OP in Dracula's palace. Because at least in Ranked/Classic, you knew how many evils there were.		I think it'd be cool if there would be a "new" role for that mode. It'd replace Retributionist, and act like VH.

@DailyMirror This one lady raped a guy and sued him for child support. He lost.
@genedavis47 @blackbirdchron @thesavoyshow Hiw does that have more to do with the video than what I said?
@genedavis47 @blackbirdchron @thesavoyshow I'm just saying that you cannot prove that this police officer wouldn't have acted differently if the guy was black. And before you ask, yes it matters. Not all cops are racist just as not all black people are criminals.

@blackbirdchron @genedavis47 @thesavoyshow That's generalization. What you did is the same thing you get made at cops for doing.
@VSIDO @thesavoyshow No. If you dont like how things are, you have a right to protest.
@genedavis47 @thesavoyshow Was it by this cop?
@scj If they did, they would have to fire all of their underage employees.
@JamesAnthonyMc5 @CJTS7006 @thesavoyshow You dont know the full context of this video. He may shoot the guy, he may taser him, he may arrest him or he may do nothing. However, you also dont know what he would do if he was black.
Did @MrPeanut just bust a nut on camera? https://t.co/1xfheASE7W
@JammyWamii @townofsalembot Prolly cuz literally everybody left the game.
@JamesAnthonyMc5 @CJTS7006 @thesavoyshow He threw his license on the ground. But I wouldn't call that an attack.
@CJTS7006 @JamesAnthonyMc5 @thesavoyshow "The man attacked him". I'm saying I dont see where the guy allegedly attacked the officer.
@CJTS7006 @JamesAnthonyMc5 @thesavoyshow I've watched it a couple times, and I cant see the part where he attacks him. Would any of you provide a timestamp?
@JamesAnthonyMc5 @CJTS7006 @thesavoyshow That still doesn't change the fact that cops are individuals and think differently than one another. For all you know, when the video cut out the man was loaded full of bullets for trying to get out.
@JamesAnthonyMc5 @Call_Me_Er @thesavoyshow You dont know what that cop would've done if he was black. You just know what the ones on the news would do.
@ZombieSkull107 @Kica333 Depends on who you're on a date with. This question could get you punched for being rude, or laid for being inclusive.
@JamesAnthonyMc5 @thesavoyshow Man who stays in vehicle with door wide open is held at gun point
@CJTS7006 @thesavoyshow Because he was talking to the alleged victim not the perpetrator?
@CJTS7006 @thesavoyshow I'm not saying that black people dont have violence committed against them. Just that this video has no relevance to white privilege.

This is why time travel was a bad idea. Stupid Chinese people with their baguettes, tea, and vodka! Maybe if they would have worried about us and not their oil, there would be 2.7 trillion more people on this Earth and not another one.
Why didn't they warn them? They could have saved trillions of lives. No wonder China and America are at a civil war. This is a major factor in China`s loss to the Aztecs in WW2. If they had warned President Cleveland about the terrorists, we wouldn`t even celebrate 9/11!!!
Today at school, we celebrated the memories of 9/11, the awful moment in American history.....but I heard that China was 12 hours ahead! Since they are ahead in time, they could have warned Obama about the terrorists in Pakistan and India that they were hijacking a plane! Right?

@GetFlexSeal When you reach the final lever, you enter a Flex Seal factory, and battle Phil with your collection of products. The game ends with a giant container of Flex Seal encasing Phil forever.....or will it?
@GetFlexSeal However, if you do, you assemble one of Phil's vehicles using the product you collected. (The product will determine difficulty). However, while escaping, Phil crashes your vehicle and you wake up in a forest. Only this time it's more difficult.
@GetFlexSeal If he does catch you, he screams "That's a lot of damage", pulls out a circular saw, screams "how about a little more?", he then shoves the saw in your chest, and you fall. It ends with Phil saying "I sawed this guy in half!"

@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei Yea. Pretty stupid claim isn't it?
@TC_in_TDot @GeorgeTakei So they cant watch the news, but they can watch our movies?

@TC_in_TDot @Leigh_ATL_SAV @GeorgeTakei Well, if they come from such broken countries, they'd take any help, and know you dont always get what you want.
@KJ_Jeller @BlackMrWilson @KyleKulinski The CEO and executives of Walmart arent even Waltons. That isnt a valid argument.
@KJ_Jeller @KyleKulinski Why take Sam's money from the family he worked for? He literally worked for the money to give it to his family. (As all people who make money do)
@Draculess1 @GeorgeTakei If they wanted help, they'd take it. They didn't, so the dont.
@browns_brewer @GeorgeTakei No, I think you're the one not reading the news. America is literally Nazi Germany, and even has Fuhrer Trump. We kill blacks, hate gays, separate families, and side with evil dictators. If America is truly this bad, they should have taken asylum in Mexico (as offered)
