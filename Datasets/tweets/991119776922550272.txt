@Mandys610 @ColMorrisDavis @KamalaHarris @DNAtv Our Veterans Administration sucks! So that’s why you need to write to your representatives and congress and get DAV involved.
@Mandys610 @ColMorrisDavis @KamalaHarris @DNAtv Plus about veterans too they also need to right to both parties Democratic and Republican in their state. I do this regularly. It’s not like fill the papers and and wait. It’s a process. I love helping out vets. But they need to meet ends too. Or they don’t get help.
@Mandys610 @ColMorrisDavis @KamalaHarris @DNAtv With your sons being active they have help. They have Liasons for advocates too if being treated bad by their higher staff. I am a ex spouse of the 82d Airborne Division. Your sons aren’t getting help they need to file grievance with the JAG office.
@Mandys610 @ColMorrisDavis @KamalaHarris @DNAtv Some of these vets don’t go and do the paperwork either for benefits. I support and advocate for vets. I give these homeless and shut in vets information to go get a advocate for DAV. County Chapter Military Advocates. That’s bull what you are saying. Your sons are active.

@CarrieChrryslsh @EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama So this lady that says military supports the Obama’s is dead wrong. He didn’t care about our troops. Nor did he want to pay them. In his term more got out of the military.
@CarrieChrryslsh @EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama Well one my brother in law is is retired military. Obama could care less about him or his family or his soldiers that are active. Another My husband and I paid out more taxes in the last 8 years when he was in office. Now we don’t we get a tax return now for the hard work we do.
@CarrieChrryslsh @EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama They don’t support her here in NC. Maybe the county of Cumberland because a lot of military lives outside the county. I know when they came to FSU I didn’t see no military spouses or active duty there.
@EpicWomenVets @MichelleObama I don’t know what military women you’re talking about. But ours at Fort Bragg don’t support her.
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Dude trump don’t owe you nothing but your client owes him money. About Cohen? Who cares about him. Cuz he’s a scam artist.
