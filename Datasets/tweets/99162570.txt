@Marghayebibi Yep that’s true ... but again the surrounding area make fun of you when you try to use words with decency. I experienced this personally .. pushtana da Americay toyran di hi um kanzalo na kai Walaka dala Charta ye Mara ?Kena kanjara phone de na receive kolo etc lol sorry truth🤐
@sabina_ahmad @NazranaYusufzai It’s because majority pashtuns grown up emotionally sick reactionary extremist type , regardless of issue Pashtuns go above and beyond . and they might didn’t even know the history of hitler so 😂 you should given a lecture before the introduction.
@Marghayebibi In sha Allah when I get them 😂 but I still don’t believe Pashtuns ba thek she . They are emotionally extremist regardless or the issues . Whatever the case will be but reaction is super hard and extreme, so better be good human 1st then pushtoonwali is secondary in my opinion 🧐
@Marghayebibi Lol well women are different then men, men hardly say in real world . Unless they grow to somewhere else or their parents are very well educated . All these comes from your society around you growing up . Lol I grow up very spoiled so it wasn’t like that please excuse me sorry 🤐

@NazranaYusufzai In my opinion it’s super hard with Afg, bcz Pashtuns are really emotional nation good 4 nothing majority are good at bragging abt each other hypocrites,I have never seen Indians on social media or in person disrespecting other people,Indians r more cool&amp;calm compare to afghans 🤐
@VOADirector hi do you think your Pashto team broadcasting honestly? There is a lot of biassed involved between Pashtuns from Pakistan and Afghanistan from VoA, They favor or brag more about Afghanistan mostly baseless issue rather focus on unity for Pashtuns .Take notice please
